The West Pokot government will commission three peace border schools in January next year. Katikomor, Akulo and Kanyerus schools are under construction and will enroll their first learners next year. On Monday, Governor John Lonyangapuo visited Katikomor. "Classrooms, dormitories and administration blocks at the three schools are almost complete ahead of the January intake. I'm impressed by the progress," he said. In his manifesto, Lonyangapuo promised to set up six peace schools in areas that had been ravaged by border conflicts.Â The remaining three will be built at Sabulmoi, Nasal and Chuwuwai, and Kamelei. Also regarded as a peace school is Sarmach Primary School. "We've already bought a 52-seater bus for the school to help pick pupils drawn from far-flung areas and are now in the process of purchasing uniforms for the pupils," the county chief said. He urged the national government and well-wishers to join the efforts to promote peace and education. Katikomor residents said the project has enabled them to live in harmony with their neighbours. Joseph Ruto thanked the governor for the initiative, saying the schools have helped in uniting children from the warring communities. "This place where the school has been set up was a battlefield for cattle rustlers. We have already begun realising the importance of the school since communities have already begun to integrate," he said. Ruto, however, appealed to the Lonyangapuo administration to set up sportsgrounds in the region so the youth from the rival communities can interact through sports. He said peace has been realised in the region and that has enhanced trade between neighbouring communities. Katikomor peace school is located along the Kenya-Uganda border and will accommodate pupils from Kenya's Pokot and Luhya ethnic groups and Uganda's Sebei community. (Edited by F'Orieny)
