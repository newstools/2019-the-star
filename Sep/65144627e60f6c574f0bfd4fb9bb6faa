Police in Kwale county are investigating the killing of a 73- year- old man in Dima village on suspicion that he was practising witchcraft. Matuga subcounty police commander Ludwin Sassati said Ngala Chuphi was reportedly killed by an unknown man who descended on him with a panga. Sassati said Chuphi was preparing supper for his two sons when the incident happened. “The deceased was cooking ugali when a man crept into his house and committed the heinous act,” said Sassati. Police said Chuphi was a widower who lived with his two young sons. Sassati said he may have been accused of witchcraft since people with grey hair have been targeted. He said investigations are ongoing and warned residents against killing the elderly on witchcraft claims, saying culprits will face the full wrath of the law. “A manhunt for the suspect has already been launched. Killing grey-haired people because of outdated primitive reasons is unacceptable and culprits will be dealt mercilessly in a court of law,” he said. The body was taken to Kwale mortuary.
