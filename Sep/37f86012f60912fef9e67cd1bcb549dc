Central Bank of Kenya Governor Patrick Njoroge has said they will not extend the September 30 for the change of new currency of Sh1,000 notes. Njoroge said if by chance you have not changed the old Sh1,000 notes by  midnight of the deadline, then notes will become valueless. Speaking during a live TV event at Narok stadium on Saturday, Njoroge urged Kenyans to desist from culture of last -minute rush to avoid making their notes irrelevant. “We have been doing sensitisation and campaigns on the new notes in radio stations, TVs and meetings in all most place in the country in order to educate Kenyans on the importance of new changes,” said Njoroge. CBK unveiled the new generation banknotes during Madaraka Day celebrations in Narok stadium that was led by President Uhuru Kenyatta as a way to control fraud and money laundering. The rollout of the new notes will also address the proliferation of illicit financial flows in Kenya and the region.
