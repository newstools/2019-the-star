After failing to bridge a single budding Kenyan player to the Spanish market through the last edition of the Chapa Dimba Na Safaricom initiative, La Liga have changed tact and will from next year begin to train grassroots-based coaches in Nairobi and Kisumu. La Liga, who have been in partnership with the Kenyan football through the Premier League will besides taking rookies to Spain, train coaches who will be tasked with the implementation of the Spanish football philosophy at the grassroots. In May, 32-member team comprising of 16 boys and a similar number of girls left for Spain for an exchange program but despite their stellar performance, none was recruited to the academies of the Spanish clubs which had sent scouts to monitor the Kenyan teams. This has prompted La Liga to revert to training local coaches who spot talented players at tender ages and guide them through the Spanish philosophy rather than taking a tactically weak team for tournaments each year. “We are considering bringing Spanish coaches to conduct clinics in Nairobi and Kisumu next year and train local coaches on several aspects of the game. We have opted for this to help drive the philosophy to many players who are not privileged to go for tournaments abroad and it will help reach many at their young ages.” said the La Liga delegate to Kenya Oliver Dodd. Dodd said Kenya had talented players but regretted a late introduction of tactical awareness as the main undoing to their growth to professional football. "I am not a coach but I have seen a lot of potential from the kids we have trained before. Unfortunately, we introduce them to football when they have come of age unlike in Europe.”
