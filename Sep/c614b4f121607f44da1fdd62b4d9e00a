Journalists confronted Senator Mithika Linturi's lawyer on Thursday after he allegedly called them "terrorists". Lawyer George Wajackoya, while making his submissions before Chief Magistrate Peter Gesora, said that the scribes covering the case could be ‘terrorists’ masquerading as journalists. The journalists did not take Wajackoya's sentiments lightly and confronted the lawyer minutes before the case took a break. “All we want is for him to table evidence that we are terrorists. If he can’t, he must apologise,” one of the scribes said. Some journalists threatened to take legal action against Wajackoya. Wajackoya had previously accused the journalists of being 'corrupt', saying they had been bribed to favour Marianne Kitany, Linturi's estranged wife. Linturi has protested against the manner in which his divorce case has been covered, saying journalists were giving Kitany more coverage than they ought to. Lawyer Danstan Omari said it was wrong for a legal officer to call journalists terrorists without evidence. "If he has evidence that these journalists are terrorists, let him record a statement with the police and table the evidence. I do not hold brief for the media, but in legal fraternity it is wrong for him to utter such reckless words,” he said. Wajackoya said his statement had been misunderstood and refused to apologise.
