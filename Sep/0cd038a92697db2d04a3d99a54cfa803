The body of Dutch tycoon Tob Cohen has been found at Kitisuru home, police have confirmed. Last month, the former Philips Electronics East Africa chairman Cohen had complained of harassment and denial of his conjugal rights by his estranged wife. Detectives and Cohen's family members are currently at the tycoon's home at Farasi Lane in Spring Valley. Cohen, 71, was reported missing on July 19 but Directorate of Criminal Investigation detectives failed to locate him. His phone was reported to be off since he went missing. His wife, Sarah Wairimu was arraigned at a Kiambu court on August 22 over links to Cohen's disappearance. Wairimu was detained at Muthaiga police station for 14 days as to complete investigations. A source at the Immigration Department said they had combed through all passenger manifestos for outbound flights for possible dates but Cohen's name was not in any. The senior official said Cohen was still in the country as there was no evidence indicating that he had left through any of the official exit points. Wairimu had allegedly told police at the Spring Valley Station that Cohen had travelled to Thailand for urgent medical attention.
