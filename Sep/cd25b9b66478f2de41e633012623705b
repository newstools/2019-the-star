BY ROBERT OMOLLO @robertomollo3 Southern Nyanza pharmacists have been told to prescribe the right medication to patients and weed out quacks from their midst. Homa Bay chief Health officer Gerald Akeche on Wednesday said professionalism must be maintained to protect the lives. The region is also home to Kisii, Nyamira and Migori counties. He expressed regrets that some people have had to die from wrong prescription drugs. His remarks came in the wake of concerns over an increase of patients developing complications due to use of drugs dispensed by unqualified pharmacists. Akeche spoke during celebrations of World Pharmacists Day in Homa Bay town. He said the number of quacks operating chemists in the region has been on the increase and blamed them for drug-related deaths. He told pharmacists to be wary of quacks who spoil for their image and ruin their profession. "Some patients have developed resistance to drugs due to the use of counterfeit drugs dispensed from unlicensed pharmacies. They cause harm to the life of patients," Akeche said. The celebration was organised by the Pharmaceutical Society of Kenya (PSK) Southern Nyanza branch. Akeche said Homa Bay government has launched a crackdown on unlicensed pharmacies. Ben Otieno, the PSK Homa Bay county liaison, warned residents against buying drugs from chemists without proper prescription from qualified medical practitioners. "We appeal to residents to seek medical advice from professionals to avoid wrong use of drugs," he said. Chief Health officer Akeche said a team of health officials and security officers are on a mission to eliminate quacks and unregistered pharmacies. "It’s important for professionals to work with security officers and ensure we weed out people behind the menace," he said. He urged residents to strictly adhere to medical prescriptions and avoid over-the-counter drugs whenever they fall sick without seeking doctor’s advice. (Edited by F'Orieny)
