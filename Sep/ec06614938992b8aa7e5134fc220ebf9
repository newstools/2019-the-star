Police in Lamu are holding a woman who allegedly torched her house following a domestic squabble with her husband at Kengen area in Mpeketoni, Lamu west. She suspected her husband was cheating on her with another woman. The 22-year-old Teresia Wanjiru is also accused of threatening to kill her husband James Kinyanjui and their one-year-old son during the incident on Thursday night. Wanjiru fled from the scene shortly after setting the house on fire but was arrested hours later by police. The woman is said to have quarreled with her husband over suspected infidelity before she angrily stormed out of the house and reappeared minutes later with a can of petrol and set the house on fire. The husband and child, however, escaped unhurt. Neighbours reported that the couple’s marriage has been riddled with frequent quarrels which in most cases degenerated into physical fights. They are known for being secretive and refusing to divulge any of their marital problems to anyone. “They are always quarreling and it’s obvious theirs is a disturbed marriage and so we aren’t really surprised that she would do that. You can tell their main issue was infidelity. She set the house ablaze and fled but the husband and child escaped,” John Kimani said. Mpeketoni OCPD Harrison Njuguna confirmed the incident and said they had arrested the woman who will soon be arraigned on arson charges and endangering lives. “We shall have her in court anytime from now to face arson charges and also endangering lives," he said. In September 2018, 30-year-old Phillip Ngugi committed suicide at his home in Matanya village in Mpeketoni after he found out his wife was cheating on him. His body was found dangling on a tree, a stone's throw away from his house.
