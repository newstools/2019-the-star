Jamaican dancehall artist Garfield ‘Konshens’ Spence has confirmed his departure from New York to Nairobi for a live concert at the Ngong Racecourse on Saturday. In a Facebook post, Konshens wrote, "My flight leaves NY in a few and I'm so hyped. Kenya had to repost this ." He accompanied the post with a one-second video, showing video samples of his 2013 hit songs like Pull up to mi bumper and Bad Gal. His confirmation comes five days after his wife Latoya Wright announced that she is now a single woman via an Instagram story post. “I am a single woman so whatever Konshens does with his life has absolutely nothing to do with me,” she wrote. Latoya in her defense said she shared the news so Dancehall fans won’t be alarmed when Konshens begin to act like a single man, “I’m not into advertising my personal life online but  I need everyone to know this so if and when he starts with the 'single man acts' then y’all know he really is single and it’s ok for him to act however he pleases.” Konshens and his longtime girlfriend Latoya Wright got married on November 2017 in a private ceremony in Miami. The dancehall veteran shared a few photos on social media from the beautiful wedding. His fans applauded him for the move and congratulated his bride and mother of his son Liam. Konshens and Latoya had been dating for a couple of years. In 2014, the “Realest Song” deejay popped the question and she said yes. After three years of being engaged.
