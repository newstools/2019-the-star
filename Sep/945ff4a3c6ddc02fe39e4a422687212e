Comedian Njugush’s wife Celestine Ndinda turned 27 years yesterday. Njugush, who met her in college, celebrated her with a heartwarming message and thanked her for being supportive. "Seven years later and life keeps getting beautiful with you. I’m so lucky to be in your life. Cheers to many more years of laughter, love and life. Dreaming with you," he wrote. "Thanks for being the greatest support system anyone would wish for! Happy 27 Mtunguyaz." Last week, the comedian said the reason he does not hold birthday parties is that while growing up, he did not have those things at his home. "It is unlike her (Celestine), whose parents celebrated their birthdays, but I am trying to change," he said. His wife responded, "Awwww thanks love."The couple has a son called Tugi.
