A section of leaders from Coast region have said they would oppose the review of the Constitution if it would burden Kenyans. They said they would only rally behind a referendum that would transform the lives of the people. Speaking during a development tour of Kilifi on Friday in the company of Deputy President William Ruto, the leaders said the proposed chang was aimed at creating more seats for a few communities and politicians. The leaders were Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa, Galole MP Said Haribae, Lunga Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani, Nominated Senator Christine Zawadi, Bura MP Ali Wario, Tana River Woman Repe Rehema Hassan, Lamu East MP Shariff Athman, Jomvu MP Badi Twalib and Kaloleni MP Paul Katana. “We would not respond to a call that is for reviving the political fortunes of some leaders,” Jumwa said. The Malindi lawmaker said Kenya had pressing issues where its resources can be channeled to such as the healthcare, infrastructure, education, agriculture and security. Katana said Kenyans did not want more positions as some leaders were proposing but service. Mwashetani said the current clamour for review of the Constitution was meant to stop Ruto from ascending to the presidency. Ruto said the country was not ready to be put under another supremacy battle through a referendum that would only benefit a few individuals. “We have a debt to Kenyans; that if making their lives better as promised in the Jubilee manifesto and the Big Four agenda,” he explained. The Deputy President said he would endeavour to support President Uhuru Kenyatta as he seeks to transform Kenya. He said a lasting legacy of the President is that of empowering Kenyans.“We must, therefore, divorce ourselves from the politics of ethnicity and division and instead, embrace unity and development-focused leadership,” he said.
