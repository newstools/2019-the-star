Rastafarianism is a religion just like any other and they should be treated as the rest, the High Court has ruled. Justice Chacha Mwita read the judgement in a case in which a minor was chased away from school on January 10 for having dreadlocks. The court ruled that the decision by Olympic High School to exclude her from school because of her dreadlocks is unconstitutional, saying it's a manifestation of her religion Her parents had argued that the locks signify their faith and she can't shave. "A child has a constitutional right to basic education," Mwita said at Milimani Courts on Friday. "Keeping rastas is her way of professing her faith and it's wrong to compel her to shave which is against her religion." The minor indicated in her admission form that her religion was Rastafarian.Â  The stance taken by the school is contrary to the law. The father in the suit papers says the action of the school amounts to discrimination on the basis of her Rastafarian beliefs. Article 30 (1) of the Constitution states that every person has the right to freedom of conscience, religion, thought, belief and opinion.
