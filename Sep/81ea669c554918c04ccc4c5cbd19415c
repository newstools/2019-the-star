 A 51-year-old trader was found dead yesterday morning in Embu market. Shocked colleagues said they found Peter Karanja hanging from the roof of one of the stalls with a sisal rope around his neck at 5am. Karanja, a fruits and vegetable trader, was from Nakuru. His wife, who also has a stall a few metres from where Karanja operated, had not arrived by the time the body was removed to the mortuary. The businessman normally arrived early and the watchman did not suspect anything and let him in as he always did. The body was later found by other traders. Police arrived at 7am and took away the body to the Embu Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary. The traders said Karanja had been jovial the previous day and could not understand why he committed suicide. Embu market gets busy from mid-morning and is frequented by traders and customers from neighbouring counties of Kirinyaga, Tharaka-Nithi, Kitui and Machakos. It is next to the busy matatu stage from where transport is available to Chuka, Meru, Mwingi, Kitui, Kutus, Kerugoya, Nyeri, Nairobi, Nakuru and nearby Runyenjes, Kirititi, Siakago, Ishiara and Kianjokoma.
