The Mombasa High Court has ordered for the release of embattled principal magistrate Edgar Kagoni on a Sh100,000 bond or an alternative cash bail of Sh20,000. Kagoni through lawyers Nelson Havi, Vincent Omollo, Daniel Wamotsa, Manasse Anada and Titus Kivui had filed a petition asking the court to stop his prosecution urging that a magistrate cannot be arrested over his judgments. “It is necessary that further criminal processing and prosecution of the petitioner be stopped by this court as a matter of urgency and during the present vacation hence the urgency of this application,” Kagoni’s petition which has the DPP as the 1st respondent and Attorney General as the 2nd respondent. Havi, the lead counsel, noted that the DPP cannot only disagree with judgements delivered in court through a revision or appeal adding that a magistrate cannot be arrested because of his judgments. The Kenya Judges and Magistrates Association had also filed a similar petition seeking the release of Kagoni pending hearing and determination of any application by the DPP. High Court judge Reuben Nyakundi noted that Kagoni’s individual independence was at stake and under threat from the executive. He further ordered the DPP be served with the ruling vial email, WhatsApp, SMS or by word of mouth to fast track the release of Kagoni. He was picked at Kilindini Police Station on Monday morning and flown to Nairobi after spending two nights at the cells. The matter will be mentioned on September 12th. Kagoni and three other court officials were arrested last Friday over the disappearance of heroin exhibits worth Sh30 million at the exhibit store.
