Three people died on the spot after the wall of a factory collapsed along Likoni Road in Makadara constituency on Thursday. Confirming the incident, Nairobi regional police commander Philip Ndolo said six others sustained serious injuries in the 11.30am incident. “The wall belonging to Gillion company that is located opposite House of Manji caved in,” Ndolo said. Ndolo spoke to the Star on the phone hours after the incident was reported. He said the company had hired people to break down the tall perimeter wall when the incident occurred. “The whole wall came down. They did not know that there were some kiosks the other side of the wall,” Ndolo added. He said it is suspected the factory was bringing down the entire perimeter wall with the intention of replacing it. The police boss said those who died including the ones who sustained serious injuries were in the kiosks on the other side of the wall. He said the injured persons were rushed to the Kenyatta National Hospital while the bodies moved to City Mortuary awaiting postmortem. Ndolo said police had launched investigations into the incident. He cautioned company managers, including Nairobi county residents, to be more careful whenever they are doing constructions in their premises, especially where there are other commercial and residential houses.
