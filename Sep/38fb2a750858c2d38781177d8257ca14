 Kiambu Deputy Governor James Nyoro has been barred from interfering with the composition of the county’s executive committee. Employment and Labor Relations Judge Onesmus Makau yesterday told Nyoro not to appoint, reshuffle, dismiss or in any way interfere with the line-up of the county’s executive secretaries, chief officers, enforcement officers and any senior officers. The ruling is likely to exacerbate the leadership wrangles at the county government that began after magistrate Lawrence  Mugambi barred Governor Ferdinand Waititu from office for his arraignment over Sh580 million tender award.  Since then, Nyoro has been acting governor and has made several management changes including cabinet reshuffles. Yesterday, resident Marion Njoroge told the Employment and Labour Relations court that Nyoro’s changes are unconstitutional. She said Nyoro had appointed David Njuguna as chief of staff, reassigned Francis Kigo Njenga from Finance to Trade and dismissed enforcement officers and casual workers. “Nyoro has openly flouted the law and abused and usurped power and authority which the law does not confer on him,” Njoroge said. She said Nyoro had violated section 32 (4) of the County Government Act that says that "when acting in office, the deputy governor shall not exercise any powers of the governor, to nominate, appoint or dismiss...” But Nyoro, through lawyer Kibe Mungai said the labour court had no jurisdiction to hear the matter and grant any orders sought. He said the issues raised are matters of a case at the High Court case due for hearing on October 4. He said it would be against the judicial policy for the two cases to be adjudicated concurrently. But Judge Makau said all those issues will be canvassed on October 2.
