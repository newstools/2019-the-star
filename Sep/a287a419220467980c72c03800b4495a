City Hall has unveiled an electronic payment system for motorists to pay parking violation penalities. Testing for the smartphone-based system started in July and is aimed at maximising revenue. City Hall's director of parking services Tom Tinega on Monday said already over 500 smartphones have been issued to the parking attendants for the purpose. "The smartphones have been configured to receive a notification when a motorist pays. The parking attendant will unclamp the cars after the notification," Tinega said. Tinega said the department will ensure that the whole city is covered in order to promote compliance. City Hall charges Sh2,000 penalty for motor vehicles caught with parking offences. Motorists whose cars have been clamped will dial *235# and follow prompts to making payments. The *235# shortcode offers residents options for different services provided by City Hall including parking, business permits, rent, bill payment and other services. It is part of the county's revenue collection system which consists of all the 139 revenue streams and all payments are done through it. The county introduced the shortcode on June 9 after it ended a contract with JamboPay, a tech firm that had been collecting its revenue since 2014. Before the new systems motorists had to pay the penalty through the bank. They would then bring the receipt to the parking office at City Hall for verification before an attendant is sent to unclamp the car. "We want to eliminate the need of having motorists walk to city hall to have their cars unclamped. We have already started to implement the new electronic claiming charges system and it is much more easier for paying the penalties," Tinega said. This manual payment system has been blamed for losses in revenue, with parking attendants accused of taking bribes to write off penalties. The new system will boost efficiency, Tinega said.
