A courageous driver who ejected a burning fuel tanker from an Embu petrol station and averted a disaster has been rewarded. James Mugo, 50, in a heroic move, risked his life after he sped the Isuzu lorry (KBS 356D) out of Independent petrol station in Rwika town, Mbeere South, on Thursday morning. The vehicle mysteriously caught fire as he offloaded petrol into the station. Embu county commissioner Abdullahi Galgalo rewarded the father of two with Sh10,000 cash, thanking him for saving lives and property. Mugo drove 200 metres away from the place. The surrounding is densely populated and the effect of a tragedy would have been of an inconceivable magnitude. He hurriedly disconnected the pipes and jumped into the tanker before speeding off as fire engulfed. Once he was out of the inhabited areas, he jumped out. The tanker soon burst into flames and burnt into a shell. County firefighters later arrived at the scene and put out the fire before it could spread. Galgalo urged other Kenyans to follow his example and be ready to sacrifice for the benefit of others. Mugo is from Othaya, Nyeri county. He said he had yet to believe what happened as it sounded like a dream, wondering where he got the courage. As he received the gift, he was overwhelmed with joy and occasionally wiped his tears in disbelief. "I can’t believe I came out of the tragedy and saved all the people occupying all those houses. I greatly thank God for the miracle. Family members and friends are also not believing and have been flooding me with frequent calls,” Mugo said. Galgalo also hailed Rwika residents for staying away from the burning tanker. (Edited by F'Orieny)
