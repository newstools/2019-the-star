At least 900 pedestrians have lost their lives this year due to road accidents across the country, Traffic Commandant Samuel Kimaru has said. Kimaru said reported accidents have increased by about 15 per cent compared to last year. “We want to take measures to reduce the accidents by making sure we follow traffic rules,” he said. He spoke in Meru town when he met matatu, taxi, boda boda operators, traffic police and the National Transport and Safety Authority officials. Kimaru said pedestrians should also follow the law when crossing the road. “As a country, we lose a lot of money on medication of accident victims. Loss of life is also a loss to the state,” he said. He cited the Subuiga area as a black spot. He also said miraa vehicles were driving at very dangerous speeds, putting lives of other road users in danger. The transport commandant said courts should not give lenient charges to traffic offenders. He said Kenyans can organise themselves to prevent accidents in their areas. National trainer for NTSA Samuel Nyaribo said that driving school instructors need to keep on refreshing their knowledge. Nyaribo said drivers of public service vehicles should also undergo refresher courses. He said all Matatu Saccos will be trained after every two years. Meru Nissan Sacco chairman Raymond Ikiara said the road safety education is good and all Saccos should embrace it.
