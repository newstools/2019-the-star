Farmers from  Ntima West ward, in North Imenti constituency, have received 7,000 improved kienyeji chicks from the agriculture research organisation. Area MCA Paul Bagine said that this was a big boost for the farmers who will receive about 200 chicks per group.  The project is funded by the county government. Bagine spoke at Kathumbi on Thursday when farmers received the one-month-old chicks. “Farmers should take care of the chicks so that they can produce more eggs, meat and also hatch other chicks,” Bagine said. He said the project is estimated to cost about Sh3 million. Meru county executive for agriculture Carol Mutiga said they will continue to support poultry farmers in such programmes as the sector is worth about Sh8 billion annually. “We will partner with South Korea Embassy in a similar project,” Mutiga said. Peter Alaru, the coordinator of non-ruminant research programme at Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation in Naivasha, said the improved chicks were better than the ordinary ones. He said in egg production, the Kalro improved indigenous chicken produces about 220 - 250 eggs in one year compared to ordinary ones that produce 80 - 100 eggs in that period. “In meat production, the improved cockerel after four months weighs about 2kg compared to the ordinary one that weighs the same kgs after eight months,” he said. Alaru said Kalro will train farmers on production methods and poultry diseases. (edited by O. Owino)
