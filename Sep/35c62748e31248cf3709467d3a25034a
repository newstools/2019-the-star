A Kiambu court on Thursday issued a warrant of arrest against a doctor for failing to appear  to plead to the charge of killing unborn child through abortion. Senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo issued the arrest order against Dr Samuel Kibira who is a doctor in public hospital following an application by a prosecutor that he had gone underground since last December. Several summons had been issued for the doctor to appear but he has not honoured them, the prosecutor said. Dr Kibira is jointly charged with Paul Wandagwa, a relative of the  13-year-old girl they allegedly helped to abort. The prosecution alleges that on December 7, 2018 at Bethsaida Catholic Dispensary in Toritu area, Kiambu, Dr Ndirangu and Wandagwa conducted an abortion. Wandagwa is charged separately with defiling the girl on several occasions at Mwandus area in Kiambu town. He is in remand after failing to raise bond of Sh300,000. However the magistrate reduced the bond to Sh200,000 pending mention of the case on October 11.
