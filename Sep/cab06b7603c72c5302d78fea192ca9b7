US President Donald Trump has fired his National Security Adviser John Bolton. Trump on his Twitter page on Tuesday said he asked Bolton to resign on Monday. He said Bolton heeded his request and submitted his resignation on Tuesday morning. “I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Adviser next week,” read part of Trump’s tweet. He said, “I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration”. But Bolton in his response said it was him who had offered to resign contrary to what Trump had implied. “I offered to resign last night and President Trump said, ‘Let's talk about it tomorrow,” Bolton wrote on his twitter. Trump’s move to order Bolton to resign comes amid speculations on his stand on Iran’s move to produce Nuclear. Bolton had twitted condemning the Iran in what he termed ‘a web of lies’, on Syria an issue Trump seems to have disagreed with. “Now that we’re two weeks from UNGA, you can be assured Iran is working overtime on deception. Let’s review the greatest hits, starting with the most recent,” Bolton wrote. He said, “Iran denied the Adraian Darya-1 was headed to Syria, then confirmed today its oil was offloaded there”. “As we reflect this week on the horrific 9/11 attack, it’s important to remember how far we’ve come in combatting radical Islamist terrorist groups but also how much work is left. We stand strong against regimes that sponsor terror & encourage violence against the US & our allies,” Bolton added.
