A cleric yesterday raised concern over the increasing number of street children in Kisii town. Rev Abel Onchari, the director Keumbu Holiness Children Home, said that the situation is worrying and needs urgent action. He said there is need to profile street children, counsel and reintegrated them with their families and relatives. “The aging street children should be profiled, counseled and reintegrated with their families and relatives. Some can resort to committing crimes to survive and risk being killed” Onchari told the Star in Kisii town. “A good number of street children happen to be boys of between 10 and 18. There is need for an urgent intervention by the county government,” he added. He appealed to well-wishers to adopt underage children and educate them to promote their welfare, noting that some are bright and can perform well if supported. The cleric said they are ready to offer land to the county government to construct a rescue centre for the children. Onchari said that the home takes care of not only orphan children but also those rescued from the streets a number of years ago. “We have been able to take care of eight street children who we rescued from the streets. Out of the number, six have joined various universities to pursue their degree courses,” Onchari said. The director urged Governor James Ongwae to partner with the children home since they have enough space to build a rescue centre. He noted a number of the children have either both or single parents who have ignored their responsibilities of giving proper parental guidance.
