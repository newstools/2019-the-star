Justus Madoya was the leading Kenyan as this year’s Uganda Open teed off at Lake Victoria Serena Resort course. Madoya, one of the local pros who made the cut at last year’s Kenya Open, posted a decent round of 2 under par 70 to wrap up the opening day among the leading players. Madoya recovered from three first-nine bogeys in the 2nd, 4th and 7th to manage scores of 37 and 33 on both nines. South African Irvin Thato Mazibuko took control of the day’s proceedings with a one-stroke lead and indeed a round 4 under par 68. The Great Rift Valley pro finished joint second with Harare born Zimbabwean Tongoona Charamba aka TC. Robson Chinhoi of Zimbabwe is lying fourth on 1 under 71 while Zambia’s Madalitso Muthiya who shot an eagle on the par-five 2nd hole settled for fifth on level par. The score wasn’t that impressive yesterday going by the high score by many golfers including Kenyans. Philip Kasozi of Uganda and Kenya’s trio of Sujan Shah, David Odhiambo and Dismas Indiza wrapped up day one play with 1 over par 73 in joint sixth. A total of 105 players including six amateurs are taking part in the event. The Uganda Open is being sponsored by Nile Breweries through its flagship brand of Castle Lite. The event has been taking place annually since 1932, hence this year’s tournament marks its 78th anniversary. The professionals were, however, included for the first time in 2006. The pro event is being preceded by the ladies and the elite men amateur events as well as Tuesday’s Pro-Am event which attracted a sizable field of pros and amateurs. The pro event will see players from 19 different countries including Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Africa, Botswana, Nigeria, Cote D’Ivoire, Ghana, Senegal, Seychelles, Swaziland, USA, Spain and Portugal battle for the $50,000 (Sh5 million) prize
