Three Kenyan fishermen are currently detained in Uganda after being arrested for alleged trespass while fishing in Lake Victoria. The fishermen, who operate from Remba Island in Suba North constituency, were arrested by the foreign insecurity officers on Friday morning. They were rushed to Hama Island in Uganda after the arrest. The foreign security officers, who are often accused of extorting Kenyan fishermen, confiscated a boat the fishermen were operating in. They also lost their valuables during the arrest. Remba Island BMU chairman Semekiah Okoth said the Ugandan security officers also took the fishermen's gears and catch. Okoth protested frequent arrests of his colleagues by officers from foreign countries. “Ugandan security officials have formed a tendency of accusing Kenyans fishermen of trespass for monetary gains,” Okoth said. Speaking to journalists over the matter, the BMU official defended Kenyan fishermen against the accusation of flouting fishing rules.
