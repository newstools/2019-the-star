Kiambu Deputy Governor James Nyoro has been barred from appointing, reshuffling or interfering with the composition of the county government's executive committee. Employment and Labour relations Judge Onesmus Makau said Nyoro should not violate provisions of Sec 32 of the County Government Act pending the hearing of a case filed by a Kiambu resident. The Petitioner, Marion Njoroge on Tuesday filed a petition against Nyoro claiming he is acting in violation of his powers. Njoroge filed the suit claiming Nyoro in the past few weeks has been violating article 179 (5) by exercising powers only limited to the governor. "The 1st Respondent (Kiambu Deputy Governor) is basically acting in clear violation of his powers and the abuse amounts to an abuse of his office as the deputy governor, "reads the petition. The matter will be heard on October 2.
