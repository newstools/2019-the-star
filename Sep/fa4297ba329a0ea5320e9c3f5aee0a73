Tana River county has received 6,000 bags of supplementary livestock feeds from the national government in drought relief aid. The animal feeds include drought pallets and mineral tabs and are meant for weak and lactating animals left at home as others migrated to Tana Delta in search of pastures and water. County director of livestock production Nzioka Wambua said the feeds will be distributed to pastoralists in Galole and Bura Tana subcounties. The supplementary animal feeds which were channelled through the National Drought Management Authority will be equally divided to the two subcounties heavily hit by the drought. Speaking to journalists in his Hola office on Monday, Wambua said the department was expecting another 2,082 bags of livestock feed from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The director called for urgent intervention from the authorities to ease the water shortage in the drought-hit northern parts of the county. Over 80 per cent of water reservoirs have dried up, he said. “I am calling for help from both the county, the national governments and donors to help us provide water to this drought-hit area,” he said. As we solve the pastures issues, we have to do something about the water shortage too, the director said.
