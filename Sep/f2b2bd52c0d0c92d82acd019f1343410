Results from three DNA tests have confirmed that Kibra MP Ken Okoth, who died in July, is the father to Nairobi MCA Anne Thumbi’s son. According to Lawyer Danstan Omari and Elkanah Mogaka, samples from international and local laboratories have confirmed that the late MP indeed sired the minor. “KEMRI results have confirmed that the probability of Okoth being the biological father of the minor in dispute is 99.999%. Conclusively, the late Member of Parliament, shujaa Ken Okoth is the biological father of the minor who was a subject of dispute,” Mogaka said. In an affidavit filed in court yesterday, Anne Thumbi argues that her son is the only living heir of Ken Okoth. “The purpose of my application before the court as pertains the paternity of the child in the matter before this court is settled,” read part of her affidavit. In the affidavit, she confirmed that the DNA sampling and testing were performed and released and the results confirmed her initial statement. By consent, the parties on August 2 agreed before the court to have the DNA samples collected for testing, which was done in the presence of four pathologists. “After the DNA samples were collected, we did have the same transported to the Kenya Medical Research Institute for testing to ascertain the paternity of my son which was being contested by the family of the late Okoth,” Thumbi said. Mumbi had moved to court on August 1 seeking to have the burial of her secret lover stopped until the controversy surrounding Jayden’s paternity was resolved. She demanded that her five-year-old son be recognised as  Okoth’s biological son and be included in the legislator’s burial plans. In the case, she sued Okoth’s mother, Angeline, his widow Monica, and the Lee Funeral Home as the first, second and third defendants, respectively.
