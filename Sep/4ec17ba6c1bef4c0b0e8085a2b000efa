Phil Foden claimed he is now ready to start featuring regularly for Manchester City. The central midfielder has played just 10 minutes for the Premier League champions so far this season after City rejected inquiries from Roma and Rangers to take him on loan. Foden has not wanted to leave the Etihad Stadium on a temporary basis but believes he should be geared up for more opportunities. Pep Guardiola told the 19-year-old to start beating his door down and demand chances but Foden insisted he will do his talking on the grass. “He has his own opinions and I stick by how I am,” Foden said. “I just know that I’m ready to play. I feel like I am. I try to show him every day in training. “There is a bit of team-mate telling me to be patient but obviously I’m hungry and want to play now. I’m going to fight for it every day. I’m ready to play whenever.” Foden was in sparkling form for England’s Under 21s as they came from behind to beat Turkey 3-2 on Friday night. The playmaker twice picked out Arsenal’s Eddie Nketiah to score, making sure Aidy Boothroyd’s new group got off to a flyer ahead of their second qualifier against Kosovo on Monday in Hull. “It will be nice if Pep watched the Turkey game but maybe he’s taken a little holiday to play golf or something! I wouldn’t blame him,” Foden added. “It’s massively important to start with a win. It gives your team a boost; when you don’t get off to a good start sometimes it can affect you. “It’s going to take a couple of games. We can already see the potential that the group has and we are only going in the right direction.” Central defender Jonathan Panzo echoed Foden’s sentiments that this England team may take a few matches and training camps to gel. “It’s the communication,’ the former Chelsea man said. ‘Even off the pitch, mingling together and things, to get to know each other. “It’s been a positive atmosphere, everybody has been talking to each other. There is already that togetherness in the group.”
