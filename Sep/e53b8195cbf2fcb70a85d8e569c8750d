Nairobi Woman Rep Esther Passaris' team on Wednesday traced a lady who had been denied access to the Dandora Health facility and was forced to deliver outside. It is alleged that the woman was forced outside the facility due to Sh20 registration fee which she did not have. According to area residents, the woman delivered outside the facility after being denied access to the facility by the staff. The team was able to buy her basic necessities such as food and other items. Passaris has urged well-wishers who wish to support the lady to do so through her. She has condemned the act and has promised that she will follow up on the matter. "It's a shame the state let her down at a critical time and I'll look into that. Meanwhile, if you have baby clothes, bedding, dry food, household stuff you wish to donate, let me know," Passaris said. The incident also led to a protest by angry women at the Dandora health center inÂ  Embakasi North Constituency. County Health executive Mohammed Dagane visited the health center on Tuesday and established that the woman was denied admission after she refused to pay the registration fee. This led to the suspension of two nurses who were in charge.
