 Basuba ward residents have reason to be happy after the opening of a Sh7 million health centre at Kiangwe village six years since terrorists torched their dispensaries. They have been without a medical facility since 2014 when al Shabaab militants looted, vandalised and torched their dispensaries. The health centre will serve the over 3,000 residents from the Boni villages of Kiangwe, Basuba, Mangai, Mararani and Milimani. Lamu Medical Services chief officer Mohamed Kombo said the new facility is fully equipped with drugs, equipment and staff. “We can’t allow terrorism to win and that’s why we are ensuring our people continue to access the services they need,” Kombo said.
