The 2016 Rio Paralympics T11 1,500m silver medallist Nancy Chelagat is targeting to break the world record at the World Para Athletics Championships set for  November 7 -15 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Chelagat, who clocked 4:42.12 at the 2016 coveted global sports carnival, to finish behind  China's Jin Zheng,  is keen to erase the latter’s world record of 4:38.92 set at the Rio Paralympics. The Paralympian said she has fully healed after picking a hip  injury at the fourth International athletics meeting in Morocco in April and she has nothing to worry about. With 43 days to the competitions, Chelagat who trains under coach Paul Kemei’s stable at Lemotit Camp in Londiani, Kericho County, admitted the assignment ahead was huge but remains focused to conquer the world. Dubai Club for People with Determination will host the Championships. “I have recovered fully and I now have ample time to prepare for the Championships. We have stepped up our training and we will keep polishing on speed work and lane discipline,” intimated Chelagat who is guided by her brother Geoffrey Rotich. Although the 24-year-old also competes in the 400m race, she is only keen on the 1,500m record and her target in the shorter event is podium finish. “I am aiming at the world record which I missed by a few seconds (3.20) in Rio. This time around, we have to break the Chinese dominance in this race,” she added. Meanwhile, the Kenya National Paralympic Committee secretary-general Elijah Mwandihi said only athletes who qualified from Morocco (Marrakesh) meeting will represent Kenya at the Championships. In Marrakesh, despite tripping, Chelagat finished fourth in the race after timing 5:11.03 and qualified for the Dubai Showpiece.
