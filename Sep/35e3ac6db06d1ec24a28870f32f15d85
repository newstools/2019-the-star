 The Teachers Service Commission Meru branch has finished interviews for secondary and primary school teachers and forwarded applicant’s credentials to the TSC headquarters Nairobi for appointments. The commission’s county director Esther Musani told the Star the selection panel which she chairs had finalised 145 slots advertised and successful candidates forwarded for vetting at the TSC headquarters for subsequent employment and deployment to 131 schools in the county. ‘’We had 145 slots to be filled in 131 schools that were recruiting. We had only 21 primary school slots. We started interviews for secondary schools on Thursday last week and ended on Tuesday this week. We are now processing them to TSC headquarters for vetting and employment,” she said. Musani, who spoke in her office in Meru town on Friday, said like many other counties, Meru county suffers from under-staffing due to shortage of teachers who may have left the profession.
