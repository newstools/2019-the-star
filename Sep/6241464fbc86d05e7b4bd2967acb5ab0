Deputy President William Ruto on Monday visited victims of the Precious Talent School tragedy at KNH. He said the Ministry of Education will carry out an audit to ascertain the safety of all school buildings countrywide to avert incidents that put the lives of learners at risk. "We must ensure a conducive learning experience for our children, including laying proper infrastructure and enhancing safety standards. Learners should concentrate on class work and not worry for their safety," the DP said. Government Spokesman Cyrus Oguna had earlier said the government will cater for the medical fees of the 64 injured pupils. Ruto sent condolences to the families that lost their loved ones.
