Development activities in Naivasha's Dry Port and Industrial Park have been banned until a comprehensive plan is in place. Naivasha deputy county commissioner Mbogo Mathioya said the development plan will indicate, among others, industrial and residential locations. The plan will be issued by the Nakuru county and national governments. Mathioya, who issued the ban, said the recently gazetted 1,000-acre special economic zone will be a "city within a county" controlled development. “We do not want to see shanties and structures that do not fit the standards. If anyone dares to erect an unauthorised structure, it will be demolished,” he said. He spoke during a community meeting at Satellite, on the Mai Mahiu highway, the site of the dry port. Mathioya urged residents to support the project as it will positively affect their lives. Naivasha MP Jayne Kihara, who was present called on the youth to enrol for courses at Naivasha Technical Training Institute and learn skills that will put them in an advantageous position when work starts at the dry port. “Everyone here is talking of employment at the port when operations begin but first enrol at the institute and get the necessary skills,” Kihara said. She at the same time complained of missing names from the list of those to be compensated for land taken by the Standard Gauge Railway. The MP promised to take up the matter with relevant authorities. Elder Joseph ole Kishau asked on the government to build schools and other amenities where families have been relocated to pave way for the project. “We are moving to a place with trees only and as much as compensation is being done, the government should help us build schools and other facilities,” Kishau said.
