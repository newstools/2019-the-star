National Super League leaders Nairobi Stima should underrate former Premier League side Mt. Kenya United at their own peril as they face off tomorrow at Ruaraka Sports ground. Stima coach Leonard Odipo said they will handle their opponents cautiously as they seek to guard their good run. Stima are unbeaten after five matches with  13 points from four wins and a draw. He said: “We respect them because they are an experienced side who have played in the top tier. Maximum concentration is therefore needed if we have to overpower them. We have to remain grounded because we have played only five matches and we are yet to achieve anything.” Mt. Kenya have suffered defeat once and are fifth on the table. Second-placed Nairobi City Stars take on Northern Wanderers, formerly Eldoret Youth, who are still searching for their first win. Wanderers' shaky defence has conceded 19 goals and City Stars will look to exploit them.
