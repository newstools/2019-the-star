Sauti Sol member Savara Mundigi is looking for a wife in Tanzania. In a recent interview with LilOmmy TV, Savara said, "I am saying this right now that I am in a big problem and I am looking for a Tanzanian wife." Adding, "If I get, I will be so happy, but if I don't, ni sawa pia." Early this year, Savara had been rumoured to be dating Yvonne Endo after the two were spotted at a restaurant in Westlands.
