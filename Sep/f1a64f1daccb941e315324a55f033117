Police on Sunday gunned down four suspects after a botched robbery along Juja Road, Nairobi. The suspects were part of a gang of six which had been terrorizing members of the public along the highway. Police officers caught up with them at around 4am. Nairobi regional police commander Philip Ndolo told the Star the suspected gangsters had robbed two White Castle residents and attempted to escape before they were killed. “The four suspects were among six others who have been robbing residents especially motorists and their passengers in that area. Police had no option when they were alerted by the public. A fire exchange between the suspects and officers ensued leading to the deaths,” Ndolo said. He said the gang is suspected to be part of a syndicate that robs members of the public of their money, mobile phones and other valuables. They are also suspected of being involved in carjacking within the city. The police boss said two fire arms with several rounds of ammunition and four knives were recovered from the scene. “On receiving the report from the victims, detectives based in Pangani police station launched a manhunt and caught up with the gang of six who disobeyed orders to surrender and engaged in a gun fight,” he said. The bodies of the suspects were removed to Kenyatta National Hospital mortuary. Those who survived escaped to Kosovo area and were being pursued by the police. A victim told police he was waiting for his gate to be opened when armed men ordered him to surrender his valuables. Ndolo said the victim reported to have been hit on the head and sustained injury after he raised the alarm, alerting police officers who were on patrol in the area. Ndolo said the suspected thugs were killed only a day after one of his officers was attacked by gangsters in the same area.
