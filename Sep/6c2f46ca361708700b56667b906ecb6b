An enumerator in Kenya is being celebrated on Twitter after being filmed dancing with children who were shouting at him: "Mtu wa census" - which means "census official" in Swahili. Collins Kiprono, who was going to count people at a rehabilitation centre in Kericho, about 275km (170 miles) north-west of the capital, Nairobi, stopped to join them in their dance. The hashtag #MtuWaCensus began trending over the weekend after the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) thanked him for making some people happy during the week-long count, which ended on Saturday. ''You showed up, put in the work and put a smile on someone's face - we celebrate you today," KNBS tweeted on Sunday: NTV then tracked down Mr Kiprono, who told the local television station what motivated him in life: "If I don’t be the reason as to why you change, I be the reason as to why you learn. "If I don’t be the reason as to why you learn, I be the reason as to why you smile." He told NTV that he had finished his university studies but had been unable to graduate because he had not paid all of his fees. He said he was digging boreholes and latrines with the hope of being able to pay off the arrears.
