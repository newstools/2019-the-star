Embattled Mombasa Principal Magistrate Edgar Kagoni has been flown to Nairobi. Kagoni was picked at Kilindini Police Station at the wee hours of Monday and flown to Nairobi. He spent two nights at the cells. Confusion was still rife whether he would be charged in Mombasa Courts, Shanzu Courts or Nairobi. There are speculations that he could be flown back to Mombasa for trial. Meanwhile, the Kenya Magistrates and Judges Association have moved to court seeking to stop Kagoni from taking plea over the loss of heroin valued at Sh30 million. KMJA says they are concerned about the threats to liberty of one its members -junior principal magistrate Edgar Kagoni - who is a judicial officer serving in the capacity of Principal Magistrate in Mombasa Law courts. Kagoni is expected to be presented before JKIA law courts this morning to take plea.
