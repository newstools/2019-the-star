Former MPs want the Parliamentary Pensions Act amended so that they can be paid at least Sh100,000 monthly. Currently, only those who served for at least two terms from 2010 are pensionable. The ex-legislators say their life out of power is miserable. It is not bad enough that Kenyaâ€™s legislators are among the highest paid in the world. They want more money upon leaving public office. Last week, Labour and Social Protection CS Ukur Yatani said at least 17 million Kenyans live below the poverty line, surviving on less than Sh100 a day. That is not what should worry the nation. It is the lives of politicians. Who in Kenya has the privilege of renegotiating their terms of service after retirement? Chapter Six of the Constitution defines public office as a responsibility to serve the people, not an opportunity to make money. Tens of millions of Kenyans struggle each day to put ugali on their table. What is so special about politicians that taxpayers must take care of them until they die? The huge public wage bill is already a national concern. It must not be increased through payments to former MPs. They should find ways to earn an income.
