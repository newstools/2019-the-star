The body of a middle-aged man was on Thursday morning found in Nairobi River. Members of Komb-GreenÂ Solutions, an organisation of young people involved in cleaning the river, stumbled on the body at 8am in Korogocho. Fredrick Okinda, the organisation's chairman, said it was the sixteenth body they have found since they started cleaning the choking river several months ago. Eight of the bodies were picked at Korogocho. The young men are used to removing foetuses, dead pigs, cats and dogs besides rotting garbage from the once clean river. "The task is daunting," Okinda told the Star by phone. At times, the young men and women dispose of the foetuses and the bodies of small children. Komb Green Solutions is made up of about 70 youths based at Korogocho, one of the slums in Eastlands. The group was founded two years ago. Nairobi River is sluggish at Korogocho. It chokes with, among others, industrial waste and sewage. Recently, the National Environment Management Authority closed over 50 companies for polluting the river. There are 102 discharge points identified along the river. Among companies closed were Synresins Chemical Factory, Modern Lithographic (K) Ltd, Apex Limited that manufactures paints, Thorlite Kenya Ltd and Kamongo Paper Recycling Company.
