A police informer charged with murder of Lawyer Willie Kimani and two others suffered a major blow after the court declined to review it's decision allowing the use of his confession as evidence in the case. Peter Ngugi who is charged alongside four other cops had asked the court to set aside it's earlier orders admitting the said confession. In the confession, Ngugi allegedly confesses to police how the three victims were brutally murdered. In her ruling, Justice Jessie Lessit has ruled that she cannot interfere with her own orders it will be like sitting on an appeal. Judge Lessit directed them to appeal the said ruling because she already made a ruling on the issue and can't review her own orders. The confession testimony of one of the accused persons had been put on hold by the court. The defence objected to the admission of the confession tape claiming they needed time to consult their clients. Four APs including Fredrick Leliman, Stephen Cheburet, Sylvia Wanjiku, Leonard Mwangi and Ngugi, have denied the charges. The Director of Public Prosecutions objected to the release of accused persons on bail on grounds they are likely to interfere with witnesses. There are only six witnesses remaining, 38 have already testified.
