Calvins ‘Kanu’ Omondi is looking to haunt his former side Police as he leads Butali in their Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) Premier League duel on Sunday at the City Park Stadium on Sunday. Kanu spent three seasons with Police, winning the Premier League title in 2017 but this time, he will be shooting from the opposite side. “As much as I had a good experience with Police who were more family, Sunday will be a different ball game,” he noted. The former Homabay Rhinos’ player said he will approach the match like any other and he is optimistic Butali will bag all the three points. He said: “It is good we are meeting them for the second time although the first encounter came too soon and I had hardly settled in the team. I am under no pressure and I hope to announce my arrival in a big way. Not scoring against Police will give me a bad feeling.” The forward, who scored twice against Parklands in Butali’s 6-0 win, feels a win for his new side will push them closer to winning their fourth trophy. “We have nine games left and I am working hard to become the club’s top scorer. Currently, I have four goals and I want to score  15 goals, which I think is achievable,” he said.
