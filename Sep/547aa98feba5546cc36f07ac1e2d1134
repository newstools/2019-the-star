Police, chiefs and assistant chiefs in Kiambu have 30 days to eliminate bhang and illicit brews in their areas, failing which they will be deployed or sacked. County commissioner Wilson Wanyanga yesterday said the ultimatum has been given under the rapid response initiative (RRI) framework. He spoke in Kiambu town during a meeting with the security team in the county. “We don’t want to call chiefs and assistant chiefs here again to talk about illicit brews or bhang. We will focus on a particular location and deal with the individuals if the brews and bhang persist in their areas. We must separate those who are working from those who are not,” Wanyanga said. He ordered chiefs to take data of all pupils sitting their KCPE exams in their areas so that in January they will follow up on them to make sure they all join Form 1. “Last year, we achieved 93% transition and we need to achieve 100%,” Wanyanga said. He said the chiefs have the responsibility to ensure all children go to school. “Next year, we do not want to see children who have attained the age of enrolling in school, loitering around. If the problem is the parent, that parent should be arrested and charged. If it is because of school fees, parents should come forward to seek for bursary,” Wanyanga said. County police commander Ali Nuno said the security team will neutralise organised gangs that have been terrorising Kiambu residents. “So far, the security in the county is at manageable levels, and we are focusing on illegal groupings that we are pursuing within the next 100 days,” he said. Nuno said they have restructured traffic management by removing some officers from the roads. “We have put a vibrant team to manage traffic,” he said.
