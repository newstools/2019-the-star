Diamond Platinumz and other WCB artistes did not attend Harmonize's wedding over the weekend. Harmonize said “I do” to his Italian fiancé Sarah Michelotti at a Muslim wedding, where only 100 guests were invited. It was held at Serena Hotel in Dar es Salaam. “Unforgettable day, I can’t wait to start a new life soon,” Harmonize said. He later serenaded his wife with a love song. Sarah was overwhelmed by the love to a point where she shed tears of joy. His former pal and label-mate, Diamond Platnumz, was not invited, nor did Harmonize invite anyone from Wasafi Crew. It is rumoured that Harmonize was not happy with Diamond when he alleged in his song 'Inama' that his wife, Sarah, cheated on him with his bodyguard, Mwarabu Fighter. Harmonize termed the disclosure wrong and disrespectful.
