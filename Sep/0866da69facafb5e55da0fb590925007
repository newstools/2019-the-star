Kenya’s Brigid Kosgei set a new world half-marathon record at the Great North Run, clocking a time of 1hr 04min 28sec. Joyceline Jepkosgei held the previous mark of 1:04:51 set in Valencia, Spain in 2017 Kenya’s women filled the top four places, but Kosgei finished more than three minutes ahead of the second-placed Magdalene Masai (1:07:36), with Linet Masai third and the three-times winner Mary Keitany fourth. Britain’s Charlotte Purdue finished fifth in 1:08:10 and will be buoyed by her form as she prepares for the World Athletics Championships in Doha later this month. Britain's Mo Farah won a record sixth successive Great North Run after setting his personal best time. The Olympic gold medallist raced ahead of Ethiopian Tamirat Tola in the final mile to cross the line in 59 minutes and six seconds. Farah, double Olympic champion at both 5,000 and 10,000 metres, said the race was an ideal preparation for October's Chicago Marathon, with his sights set firmly on running at the Tokyo Olympics next year. "The crowd was so loud I didn't know if he was closing the gap so I kept looking behind," the 36-year-old told BBC Sport. "I've really enjoyed it but the past couple of years has been in the middle of marathon preparation. It was good to test myself. Things are looking good and I'm happy with the win. "Tokyo is definitely on the cards - as an athlete you always want to represent your country. You just have to take it one year at a time. Hopefully, come Tokyo time, we will be in the mix. Britons were also strong in the wheelchair events, with Simon Lawson third behind Canadian Brent Lakatos in the men's race. Former women's wheelchair champion Shelly Woods, who only returned to competition in May following the birth of her son in 2017, finished second behind compatriot Jones-Hall, with Poland's Martyna Snopek third.
