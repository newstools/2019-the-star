Meru Senator Mithika Linturi's lawyer Muthomi Thiankolu told the court on Monday that the exchange of miraa does not constitute a marriage. Muthomi said that Marianne Kitany's acceptance that she is not Meru indicates that she would not know anything about it. He also claimed that drinking mursik is not a symbol of marriage as Kitany told the court previously. Muthomi made the submissions while cross-examining Kitany in her divorce case with Linturi at the Milimani Courts in Nairobi. He added that the senator attended a different function in Nandi and not marriage ceremony as claimed by Kitany. Muthomi told the court on that Kitany lied by saying that Linturi was in Nandi for a wedding when he was there for functions that had nothing to do with marriage. He argued that engagement and marriage are not the same things, ruling out Kitany's document showing the court an engagement invitation. Muthomi said all documents on customary marriage shown by Kitany had different dates, hence showing inconsistency. He added that Linturi's parents never and siblings never attended the function and his client was not there when the supposed wedding took place. Muthomi also said that Linturi's friends who Kitany claims were there during the ceremony were out of the country. Kitany told the court that her witnesses from Meru who attended the marriage have been threatened not to testify. Taking over from Muthomi, lawyers George Wajakoya said that the court should declare Kitany a hostile witness and also have her to undergo a psychiatric test. He added that Kitany's parents visited Linturis home after their traditional wedding and Linturi never paid any dowry. The lawyer told the court that  Kitany's mum was the director of Atticon, that's the reason why the car which was a gift to Linturi was never transferred to her name.
