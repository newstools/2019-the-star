Kenyan boxing legend Nick Abaka is determined to shape the next generation of pugilists after hanging up his gloves earlier this year. The soft-spoken but hard-hitting KDF boxer has been crashing the gym with youngsters at the Kariobangi Social Hall, where he honed his skills in the mid-nineties to become one of the most recognisable fighters in the country in recent years. “I think it is important for those of us who have been in the ring for years to nurture the next group of boxers. Not all of us can be coaches at the senior or elite level. But even if we are, it’s crucial that we  are able to mould eager novices,” he remarked The former welterweight and light heavyweight champion revealed that support from parents and the communities is key if the kids are to achieve their potential. “So far the kids are coping up well. The exercises are keeping them busy from drug abuse and other vices in the community. Most of them are just very happy to join the boxing world,” said Abaka. The boxers initiative is run through his ‘King Abaka Foundation’.
