A man was last week charged with stealing three roles of tissue from Strathmore University. Benard Kibet was charged with stealing the rolls of toilet paper valued at Sh300, which was a property of Strathmore University. Kibet was arrested and charged after Strathmore through the security controller Christian Angwenyi made the complaint to the police. Angwenyi said that on August 29, 2019, within the university located in Langâ€™ata subcounty in Nairobi stole the toilet paper. Alternatively, he is charged knowingly with handling stolen goods and keeping it for his own use. Appearing before Chief Magistrate Joyce Gandani, Kibet admitted to committing the offense. In his defense, he said he was not aware that it was a crime to take the toilet paper. He was fined Sh5000 or a jail term of one month.
