WESTERN Delight have been relegated from the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) Premier League, according to competitions secretary Joseph Amoko. He said the Kakamega-based side’s fate was sealed after they lost their two weekend home fixtures. They have won only one of their 19 matches and have three games left to play. Coach Donald Liru, who has ensured the team remain in the top tier for the last nine years, said he has played his role and it was time to let go. “I have played my part. It has been a long journey and now I will no longer have any role to play in the team,” conceded the Kabkara secondary school headmaster. Delight suffered heavy defeats at home over the weekend going down 105-33 and 74-35 to Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) and Africa Nazarene University respectively. “They have only three matches left and they surely will not make it. One of the three university sides will join them in the drop,” disclosed Amoko. He said Delight are likely to be joined by either Kenyatta University, Africa Nazarene University and United States International University. “These three varsity sides have the least wins in the race to survive the axe. One of them will join Delight,” said Amoko. Delight will host the University of Nairobi Dynamites this weekend before travelling to the city on October 12 for their last two fixtures. The race for the top spot ahead of the play-offs intensified with the KPA win moving them one point behind leaders Equity Bank Hawks.  The bankers have 37 points having lost only one match to KPA. The porters are on 36 points with two loses to Storms and Equity Hawks. Zetech University are third while Strathmore University are fourth all on 33 points. Storms and Eagle Wings have 31 points and are fifth and sixth place respectively.
