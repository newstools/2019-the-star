FKF National Super League side Shabana have received a major reprieve after the Kisii County government allowed the financially struggling club to use Gusii Stadium for free for six months. Club chairman Jared Nivaton yesterday said he held a fruitful meeting with Governor James Ongwae and his Deputy Joash Maangi who issued an order to waive stadium charges for a period of six months with an option of extension. Nivaton said the governor assured him that the clubs expenditure will be factored in the country's supplementary budget.  “It was a very positive decision from our leaders to grant as the stadium waiver and I'm looking forward to a very positive outcome,” said Nivaton. Shabana have been paying Sh20,000 to use the stadium per game. Last season, the club was only paying 15 per cent of gate collections for the use of the facility. Besides paying for the stadium, clubs also fork out Sh10, 000 for referees. Shabana have relied on contributions from Nivaton, his vice Nyandoro Kambi and fans to honour their home and away matches. Shabana are scheduled to host Kibera Black Stars at Gusii Stadium on Sunday,  looking to return to winning ways. On Monday, the former giants lost 2-0 against Administration Police at Camp Toyoyo in Nairobi.
