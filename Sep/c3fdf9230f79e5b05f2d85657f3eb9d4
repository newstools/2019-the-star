A man is recuperating at Mama Lucy Hospital after he was shot by thugs at Dandora estate on Thursday night. Daniel Mungai, 40, sustained bullet injuries after armed gangsters stormed his Green Shop Mini Supermarket in Kamkunji constituency and shot him three times. His injuries were on the stomach, left hand and shoulder. Kamkunji subcounty DCIO Adan Guyo told the Star on Friday that the matter was reported to Dandora police station at 8.30pm. The incident was recorded at the station under OB Number 66/12/9/2019. “A group of three young men armed with a pistol entered into the said supermarket and ordered the owner to give out all the cash he had. He gave out an unknown amount,” Guyo said. The shop has since been closed. A witness said the gangsters posed as customers visiting the mini-supermarket before they made the attack. “They first robbed a client whom they first met at the shop. They later turned to the business's proprietor whom they ordered to give them all the money in his possession. “He surrendered money of unknown amount but later started following them as they escaped from the shop,” she added. The source said that the thugs turned their gun on the man when he ran after them shouting ‘wezi, wezi, wezi’ (thieves, thieves, thieves). “I heard three shots from my hiding place, the thugs then ran away.” Guyo said that some police officers who were on patrol within that area were alerted, rushed to the scene and found the victim lying on the floor. The robbers escaped on a waiting motorcycle of an unknown registration number. He said the officers rushed the victim to Mama Lucy Hospital where he has since been admitted and is in a stable condition. “The scene was visited by Stapol and his team who recovered six spent cartridges of 9 mm. The officers are still combing the area,” Guyo said. (edited by O. Owino)
