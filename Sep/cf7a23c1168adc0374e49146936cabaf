Roy Hodgson has warned Crystal Palace fans to prepare for ‘suffering’ and ‘heartache’ this season as he predicts another difficult campaign to beat relegation. The 72-year-old Palace boss guided the club to 12th last season but limited high-profile arrivals has seen Hodgson remain pessimistic despite a strong start to the latest campaign. As reported by the Evening Standard, Hodgson, who was speaking at a Palace for Life event, has looked to keep expectations realistic for the campaign ahead. When quizzed on whether Palace can kick on from last year and trouble the top order, Hodgson was largely dismissive. He said: “I would like to say that to you but if I’m realistic I’m not certain I can. I think staying in the Premier League is always going to be the be all and end all for us and always going to be a fight, a bit of suffering.” “There’s not going to be rainbows and blue skies and rose coloured spectacles all the way through. There’s gong to be plenty of fighting and heartache along the way.” Palace mark their return to domestic action with a London derby away against Tottenham tomorrow.
