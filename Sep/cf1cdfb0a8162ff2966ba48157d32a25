ULINZI Warriors coach William Balozi believes the road is all clear for Ulinzi Warriors to top the log heading into playoffs despite struggling to beat World Hope 56-51 over the weekend at the Nyayo Stadium gymnasium. Balozi said going by the statistics and the way Ulinzi are playing, they are bound to top the regular season and go into the playoffs as top seeds. “I have done my mathematics and my goal is to finish ahead of Thunder and KPA,” he observed. He explained that he has only two matches left against Umoja and second-placed Thunder before he completes his fixtures. “I am the only team with one loss in the league. If I get even one win, I will be fine for the summit and that is all I am targeting,” he added. Ulinzi took the first two quarters and led 35-28 at the breather. However, World Hope snatched the third 12-8 before trailing 13-11 in the last. Alvin Nyangweso nailed 14 and John Washika added 10 for Ulinzi. Equity Bank recovered from an 88-78 overtime loss to Ulinzi the previous day to humiliate United States International University 76-35. Titus Musembi scored 17 points and Lenson Kisia added another 13 for the bankers who went on a 26-5 last stanza blitz to win easily against the Tigers. In Eldoret, debutants Eldonets eclipsed Emyba 83-66 at home to send strong signals about their play-offs intentions in only their debut. Eldonets took a strong 47-37 lead at the break but Emyba rallied to take the third 17-15 before they were overwhelmed 21-12 in the last.  Clifford Mumbo sunk 13 points and George Oyoo added 11 for the host.  Emyba had 18 from Tony Mwendwa and13 from Eugene Adera.
