Debora Makandi allegedly could not endure living with a son from her estranged husband and her new lover. A Meru court on Friday heard that Makandi, 23, killed her son Noah Mutethia Mutuma within the Meru Township Imenti North on May 29. Resident judge Alfred Mabeya ordered her detention until October 24 when a probation report will be submitted, determining whether she will be freed on bond. The Meru woman denied strangling her six-month-old son after being caught in between a love triangle with her son’s biological father and another man. She had at first reported that the child had died of malaria and diarrhoea upon arrival at Meru Teaching and Referral Hospital but the child’s father Dominic Mutuma dismissed the claims. Mutuma demanded an autopsy that determined the child had been strangled. The two met in 2013 when the suspect was a student. Mutuma is a secondary school teacher in Igembe North. After Makandi finished her studies, the two separated and she went to Nairobi where she fell in love with another man, Isaiah Mwongela. She has lived with him since then. Last year in February, Makandi and the teacher started dating again and spent a night together which resulted in the pregnancy, the court was told. The teacher at first declined to take responsibility but later changed his mind and invited the woman to stay with him. Police say Makandi decided to kill her son in order to break up with Mutuma after Mwongera set up a business for her at Gitimbine in a show of love. Through her lawyer Joy Kinoti, Makandi applied to be supplied with copies of the charge sheet and all evidence and statements the prosecution intends to use. She also asked the court for lenient bond terms saying she was the sole breadwinner of her family. The court ordered the prosecution to supply the defence with the documents within two weeks and a pre-bail report to be availed within 30 days. Edited by R.Wamochie
