Yuvraj Rajput and Zameer Verjee have sealed the KCB Kenya National Autocross Championship titles following brilliant racing displays. The two had their title campaigns effectively sewn up with during the penultimate round of the series at new Moi International Sports Centre (MISC), Kasarani racetrack. Yuvraj, who has swept the ground with all his opponents in Bambino Class, savoured back-to-back titles after restricting his teammate Tsevi Soni to the title. “It feels really good to finish the job at the penultimate stage. The track was really loose today, but I soldiered on to the very last heat,” Yuvraj said. Zameer Verjee took top honours in 2WD non-Turbo class on his first full year in class and savoured the championship title. Yuvraj was fastest through early practice where he beat Tsevi by 5.10 seconds. But Tsevi bounced back to take first heat by almost a minute. Yuvraj was at it again in the second heat where he beat Tsevi by 17 seconds. Yuvraj was fastest again by 5 seconds in the third heat. The 4WD tussle between Bengi and Omar was breathtaking. Sahib didn’t finish the practice lap after he broke the gear-lever of his Subaru Impreza. Bengi lost the first heat to Sahib by a mere 5 milliseconds. He then picked himself up in the second, where he beat Sahib. “I broke the gear-lever in practice but sorted it well in time for the first heat. We had a good fight with Bengi and it’s always good when you have someone pushing you.” Bengi said. Bengi, on the other hand, said: “We came to Kasarani to have some fun and I’m glad the race went well. The track was quite slippery and the track all over the place. The autocross set up has always been a good platform to practice for the rally,” said Bengi. Mombasa Motor Club will host the last round of the series at the MCL track in Vipingo on October 13.
