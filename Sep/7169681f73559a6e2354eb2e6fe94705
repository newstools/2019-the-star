The government will from this month disburse Sh12 billion for water projects at the Coast. Deputy President William Ruto said the disbursement follows an agreement the state signed recently with governors from Kilifi, Kwale, Mombasa, Taita Taveta and Tana River counties. Ruto expressed optimism that the funds will address water challenges in the region. The DP spoke in Kilifi after commissioning the 5-million-litres water reservoir on Friday. The reservoir will serve Kilifi, Mariakani, Mtwapa, and other towns. The project which included a pipeline from Baricho, Kakuyuni to Kilifi cost Sh2.3 billion “The government is committed to ensuring every home has access to clean and adequate water. That is why governors from this region came to my office and we signed an agreement to release funds for water projects,” Ruto said. The deputy president said Kilifi county will receive Sh2.5 billion this month. Ruto was accompanied by Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa, Nominated Senator Christine Zawadi, Lamu East MP Sharrif Athman, Garsen MP Ali Wario, Galole MP Said Hirbae and Tana River Woman Representative Rehema Hassan. Coast Water Services Board chairman Mustafa Idd said the project will greatly improve water reticulation in Kilifi and other major towns in the county. “We now expect Kilifi county government to do their part by making sure villages are connected to water pipeline,” Idd said. The project was done under Water Supply and Sanitation Improvement Project (WaSSIP) with funding from the World Bank. (edited by O. Owino)
