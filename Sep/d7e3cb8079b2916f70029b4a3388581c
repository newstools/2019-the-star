Police in Bomet are trying to unravel an incident in which a man was found unconscious with an ear chopped off and his left hand broken. He was found at the same spot in Bomet town where another man was found murdered on Thursday night. The middle-aged man was discovered by a passerby at around midday who alerted the residents and the police. The man was found naked and bore wounds similar to those on the body of the murdered man. He was rushed to Tenwek hospital where he is currently receiving treatment. The lifeless body of the 35-year-old had the left ear chopped off while his eye was gouged out. The body lay in an open field next to a Kenya Breweries depot a few meters from Kings Outreach Church. The body also had a deep cut on the thigh. Bomet Central subcounty police commander Musa Omari said they were yet to establish the motive of the killing and the latest attack. He called on anyone who might have information that might lead to the arrest of suspects to volunteer it. The two men, according to residents, had been working in Bomet town as mechanics but in different garages. “We are yet to establish the motive behind this incident because when you try and look at their bodies they have not been hit with blunt objects or with anything sharp,” Omari said.
