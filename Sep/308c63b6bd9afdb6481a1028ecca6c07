A section of Tana River leaders has dismissed those opposed to relocation of the county headquarters from Hola to Dayate in Galole constituency. The transfer  will cost Sh800 million. Tana River  Governor Dhadho Godhana told residents to differentiate between politics and development if they were keen on the transformation of the county. Speaking in Hola, Godhana said the move was meant to open up the area for development under the municipality program initiated by the national government together with donors. Already the county government received Sh180 million to kick start the project of relocating the county headquarters. “For long you have been cheated and lagged behind in development. We sat as leaders and agreed to forget other voices from outside and deal with elected leaders," Godhana said. The governor said he would not allow residents of Tana River to suffer in terms of development because of a few individuals who were trying to oppose the location of the new headquarters. Tana River county has delayed in implementing the project which has a deadline of three years due to the politics surrounding the investment. At the same time, the governor announced buildings constructed on road reserves will be demolished in Hola town to pave way for tarmacking of the roads. Godhana said areas to be affected include Laza, Mikinduni, Kalkacha and Hola Mishe. “I even told the MCA to to be prepared as I will pass by the area one of these days.  I don’t want people to suffer in terms of access to water and electricity," he said. Senator Juma Wario commended the county assembly for passing the bill which approved relocation of the new county headquarters to Dayate. Two weeks ago residents protested against the county government's move to relocate its headquarters on proposed land, claiming there was malice in the proposal. The residents drawn of Dayate village, the area proposed for construction of the county offices, claimed they were not consulted on the isseue.
