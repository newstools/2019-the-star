President Uhuru Kenyatta's agenda for the Blue Economy has gained momentum. The President has personally been overseeing the development of the Shimoni Fish Port, the Lamu Port and the Kisumu Port. The marine sector has been neglected. While touring Lamu on Sunday,  Uhuru announced that the first berth of the new Lamu Port will be opened on October 20. He said during the launch, a ship will dock and offload cargo. “Offloading of cargo will be the beginning of jobs not just for you but also for the youth of Lamu and the entire country," he said. On Saturday, the President visited the Shimoni fish landing site in Kwale. The government, through the Kenya Ports Authority, is upgrading it into a modern fishing port. The Sh500 million project will be completed in eight months. The government plans to put up cold storage facilities,  modern offices for various state agencies and berths for light cargo vessels. President Kenyatta Uhuru said the fishing port and supporting infrastructure will spur the economy. The government, he said, will sponsor 150 youth from the area to attend coxswain training at the new Bandari Maritime Academy. The head of state also went to Kibuyuni town to insect construction of a fish processing factory by a Chinese investor. It will process 200 tonnes o per day. The factory will directly employ 500 people from the area and provide a ready market for hundreds of fishermen from Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Somalia and Madagascar. The President also toured the Kibuyuni Seaweed Farmers factory, a project by a local women group. The government-supported group is engaged in crop to make soap. In Kisumu, the President is personally monitoring the Sh3 billion rehabilitation of the Kisumu Port. Edited by R.Wamochie
