  Detectives are looking for the boyfriend of a police constable seized in connection with the theft of Sh74 million from an ATM in Nairobi. The man, identified as James Macharia, is suspected to have escaped with part of the money. AP constable Florence Wanjiru Karuku, who was guarding the Equity Bank ATM, is said to have told detectives that she handed over a money bag to her boyfriend Macharia. The disclosure followed the arrest of three police officers and a KDF soldier on Thursday night. Constables Simon Gichui, Karuku and Caroline Waithera were arrested alongside KDF's corporal Eunice Wangari attached to Kahawa West Garrison. According to the DCI, Gichuhi and his wife, Waithera, were arrested in Thika town where they had gone to see a lawyer to apply for an anticipatory bond in connection with Nairobi West ATM theft. “The two led the police to Kahawa Barracks where it was established that their sister, Eunice Wangari Karuku, (KDF officer) with whom they had allegedly left the money had gone to Nyahururu for a burial,” a detective said. The suspects told the detectives that the money bag was one of their sisters, Florence Wanjiru Karuku, who guarded an Equity Bank. “When the detectives found Wanjiru, she informed them that when she got the bag she called her boyfriend, namely James Macharia, who escaped with the money bag in a motor vehicle KCB 841X to an unknown destination.” Corporal Eunice Wangare Karuku was arrested in a police ambush. She was found in possession of a Toyota Mark X, KBX 779R, suspected to have been bought with the stolen money.
