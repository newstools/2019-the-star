Some couples ride on horseback. Some on chariots. Some drive in limousines. Yet others walk from the church wedding venue to the reception. But a  boda boda operator in Embu and his newly wedded wife on Saturday took this ritual to another level. Julius Muchui and Sherine Kathambi took a three-kilometre ride on the bucket of an excavator from the  Full Gospel Church Kianjai to Kianjai Primary School. Friends and residents of the busy Kianjai village in  Tigania East subcounty in Meru county were both amazed and amused at their choice of transport. The excavator was decorated with purple, white and pink fabric, the wedding theme colours the couple had chosen. The newlyweds were driven slowly and carefully to the reception venue. They were flanked by high-end vehicles the couple had used to come to church. Boda boda riders joined the procession and onlookers thronged the sidewalks to catch a glimpse of the new couple in town who smiled and waved as the rode. Perched on the excavator bucket Julius Muchui was dapper in a fitting three-piece purple suit, pink tie and brown shoes. Kathambi, on the other hand, shone in a well-fitting snowy white flowing gown. She wore white gloves, a  white necklace, white veil and held a bouquet of white and pink flowers. The wedding was presided over by Bishop David Kaibunga. Earlier, the bride and groom had been separately driven to the church in Toyota Prados only to leave the comfort of the cars and opt for the excavator. Muchui told the Star they wanted to show that they are ready and determined to make their marriage work and also improve their living standards. “We don't want to just live in luxury in our marriage but we also want to join hands in everything so that we can succeed. We hope God will guide us in our endeavours,” Muchui said. He said he wanted their wedding to be unique, saying his bride did not object to the idea of riding on an excavator during their wedding.
