 The rehabilitation of the City Stadium is expected to be completed before the end of this financial year, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has said. The 10,000-seater stadium – the oldest in Nairobi – has been shut since 2015 when the Kenyan Premier League condemned it as unfit to host competitive football matches. On Monday, Sonko announced, “Rehabilitation of City Stadium is underway to ensure the historic stadium is upgraded to the required standards.” Past administrations were never short of promises to bring the stadium to the highest standard possible. Former Governor Evans Kidero and his Sports minister Anne Lokidor announced in December 2016 that Sh200 million had been set aside for the renovation of the stadium. They did nothing towards that end. Sonko was elected governor in 2017. Among his many pledges to Nairobi residents was the restoration of the City Stadium and "improve it to international standards in order to give youth an opportunity to nurture their talent." That statement was made last year in November. The governor said three other stadia would be erected in Ziwani (Kariokor), Ndurarawa (Riruta) and Kihumbuini (Kangemi). Already, the county is doing final touches on Dandora Stadium. The renovation of the City Stadium includes the replacement of the astroturf, redoing the running tracks, construction of terraces and changing rooms. The other facilities will be a VIP lounge (to be installed), refurbished washrooms, new street lights and a squash court. Also to be erected is a perimeter wall for enhanced security. There is a proposal for a gymnasium with rooms for indoor games.
