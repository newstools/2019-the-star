Quins coach Dominique Habimana has set his sights on winning the Kenya Cup crown this season. The Ngong Road giants last won the league crown in 2012 and the  Rwandese-born tactician said their goal for this season will be to go all out and bag the league. “We have fallen short in the last couple of years and we need to come back stronger this season and compete against KCB and Kabras,” noted Habaimana. Quins reached the Kenya Cup semis finals last season but were blown away in the semifinals, losing 46-13 at the Lions Den in Ruaraka. Quins then lost in the semifinals of the Enterprise Cup, going down 54-11 to eventual winners Kabras. Habimana, who is making a second return to Quins, said he will be using the Impala Floodlight tournament which starts over the weekend as preparation for the Kenya Cup next month.  "The floodlight event is a good pre-season event to test our combinations, systems and execution in both defence and attack," he added.  Quins play Nakuru in the  Floodlit quarterfinal and Habimana is expecting a stern test from the Wanyore. The winner of the match will face the winner of the Impala v Menengai Oilers quarterfinal in the semifinal.
