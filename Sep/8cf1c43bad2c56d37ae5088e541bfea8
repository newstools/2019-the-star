A company tarmacking a Murang'a road has been told to relocate water pipes along the route before it can proceed with the work. This followed a court order sought by Kahuti Water and Sanitation Company MD Ephantus Kamau, who accused S.S Mehta Construction Company fo destroying the pipes along the Kiria-Kagaa-Githambo road. The destruction cut water supply to many institutions and families, prompting a public outcry. Resident magistrate Victoria Ochanda granted the application barring the road firm and the Kenya Rural Roads Authority (Kerra) from proceeding with works. “An urgent temporary injunction is hereby issued restraining the respondents from wasting, damaging and interfering with claimant’s pipelines along the road under construction pending an inter-parties hearing,” she said. In an affidavit, Kamau said residents of Murarandia and Mugoiri areas of Kiharu constituency were left without water after earthmovers wrecked the pipes. He said schools, dispensaries and other public institutions have turned to a stream for water and that exposes them to the risk of contracting waterborne diseases. "The company is losing revenue that it collects from the supply of water from the residents, and risks the inability to pay salaries, among other expenditures," Kamau said. In the past five months, Kahuro residents have decried massive destruction of water pipes leading to acute water shortages. Barely two months ago, another water firm — Murang'a Water and Sanitation Company (Muwasco) — raised concerns after a road construction company destroyed water pipes along the Mukuyu-Gwathamaki road in Murang'a East. The Chinese company was compelled to replace the pipes before it was allowed to continue its construction works. (Edited by F'Orieny)
