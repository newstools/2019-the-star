Wolverines coach Gordon Oduor has warned his players against complacency as they chase promotion to the Kenya Hockey Union Premier League. The Super League team has been in to form winning seven matches on the trot to perch at the top of the standings with 21 points, eight more than second-placed Orange Leonas and UoN. Since suffering 1-0 losses to both University of Nairobi (UON) and Multimedia University (MMU) in the opening two matches, Wolverines are yet to taste defeat again and Oduor hopes a continuation of this form with five matches to go. “We are enjoying a winning-streak and we would like to maintain that until the end even though it won’t be easy. The prospect of playing in the Premier League thrills the girls,” said Oduor. “We cannot afford to rest on our laurels. We need to train hard, remain calm and be positive going forward. We have to fight to the end and win matches no matter the scoreline.” Oduor lauded the performance of the new faces after losing a number of senior players. He said: “We lost some of our players for a course and family matters but those who have replaced them temporarily have done a good job. Even though we have played differently, results are evident.” Wolverines will be keen to bag three points when they take on Technical University of Kenya (TUK) on Saturday.
