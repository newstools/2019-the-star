Deputy President William Ruto has said the government will come up with a working mechanism to restructure and conclude the programmes under the reformed NYS, to the benefit of the Kibra community. He spoke during a rally in Kibra on Wednesday afternoon. He was accompanied by MacDonald Mariga who is vying for the Kibra MP on the Jubilee Party ticket. "Truly we had a programme that helped the youth and not only in Kibra but many Kenyans. But a while back the programme developed some difficulties so we stopped it for a while so as to take care of challenges that were in there so that we can see how the programme can move forward," Ruto said. He added that the new director general of NYS, Matilda Sakwa, will sit down with her officers since NYS did not have a board or council to help management run the NYS. "But now the President has elected a council that is led by Major General which will make sure NYS has a council and management that will help solve issues so that nothing goes wrong again," Ruto said. Mariga said that he doesn't want an office but rather wants to go round Kibra to know the challenges the people of Kibra face. "When there are any issues we address them together and I said I don't want an office. My office will be here speaking to everyone. I don't want an office whereby when someone comes in the office you lean back on the chair. We want to walk all over Kibra so as to know the challenges facing us." He added, "We have decided to leave the football world for the youth to also play so that they can get to where we are. And I will also teach them football. So sports in general we will fix it."
