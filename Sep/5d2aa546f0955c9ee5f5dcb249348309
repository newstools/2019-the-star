Former Kenyan Premier League side Mt Kenya United have not hidden their intentions of returning to the top flight at the end of the current National Super League. United were axed from the top flight after finishing bottom last season but the club has its sights trained on automatic promotion after gathering eight points from four matches—four behind Shabana who now top the league. Yesterday, Thomas Okong'os charges came from a goal down to hold a winless Kenya Police to a one-all draw at Camp Toyoyo to register their first draw of the season. United seemed headed for their second loss of the season but Clement Masiko netted in the final minutes of the match to cancel Peter Njoroge's goal. Okong'o, who replaced Melis Medo, said automatic promotion will be theirs to lose if they finish in the top three by the end of the first leg. “We want to finish in the top three at the end of the first leg then seek to go top in the second leg. We have young players who play according to my instructions and it will be easier to attain our target with them. We are hoping to return to the top flight at the end of the season.” In other matches played, Shabana bagged their fourth win of the season without breaking a sweat after their opponents St Joseph Youth failed to turn up for the match earlier planned for Gusii Stadium. The walkover lifted Shabana to the top of the league with 12 points, one ahead of Vihiga United who beat Murang'a Seal 3-1. Administration Police saw off Kibera Black Stars 1-0 at Camp Toyoyo while Bidco United's unblemished run came to an end after going down 1-0 to Nairobi City Stars. Debutants Vihiga Bullets beat Modern Coast Rangers while Nairobi Stima played Ushuru to a barren draw at Karuturi grounds.
