Ulinzi Stars striker Enosh Ochieng is keen to retain the golden boot in the 2019-2020 season. “This season, I want to score more goals and retain the golden boot. I know it's not going to be easy but I must work hard to achieve it,” he said. Last season, Ochieng scored a hattrick in a rescheduled match against Mt Kenya United to win the golden boot beating former international Allan Wanga of Kakamega Homeboyz to second place. Wanga notched 18 goals while former Sofapaka striker Omaru Kasumba was third with 17 goals. “Last season, I scored 20 goals. This time around, I want to score more goals. I pray that I remain injury-free throughout the season,” said a confident Ochieng. Ochieng 28, spoke to the Star after bagging a brace in their 2-0 win newbies Kisumu All-Stars at Moi Stadium in Kisumu on Saturday. The battle for the golden boot this season is likely to be hotly contested with Gor Mahia captain Muguna and Tusker's Boniface Muchiri both scoring twice on matchday one. Gor Mahia pipped the brewers 5-2 in an entertaining seven-goal thriller match at Moi Stadium. Ochieng said he is also keen to cement is place in the national team Harambee Stars. “I'm looking forward to more call ups to the national team. I know competition will be stiff but if I continue scoring goals I'm sure I will achieve my goals.” Ochieng was recently named among 10 reserves by new national team coach Francis Kimanzi for the friendly match against Uganda on September 8.
