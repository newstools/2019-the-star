Singer Akothee has of late been meeting the who is who in the government. On Wednesday, she visited Parliament to invite MPs to the launch of Akothee Foundation. Last Friday she met Rachel Ruto. Speaking to Word Is, Akothee described Rachel as a humble leader. “Having met Rachel has changed my mind. She is humble and after sharing my journey with her she is proud of me and promised to support me in whatever way.” The foundation will be opened on September 28 and will support people in Turkana. “I plan to sink six boreholes, build a school and a church in every rescue centre. I have other government officials from other countries like Italy,” she said. Akothee says she is not interested in politics and will not run for office. “I wouldn’t change my lifestyle and dress code for anyone. Politics for me is still a no. Not today, not in 20 years but I will try and help where I can and bring more investors to the country.”
