National Hit Squad will take a tentatively one month break before resuming training ahead of the Olympic qualifiers after scooping silver and four bronze medals in the just concluded All Africa Games in Rabat, Morocco. After a fairly good outing in Rabat, assistant coach David Munuhe praised the pugilists who competed at the 12th edition of the continental sports extravaganza. He said: “This was the second-best performance for Kenya after the 2007 All Africa Games in Algeria. We had really strong opponents from the likes of Egypt and Algeria and I am happy we returned home with medals," he added. Shaffi Bakari of Police scooped silver in the flyweight category, while Elly Ajowi (heavyweight), Fredrick Ramogi (super heavy), Boniface Mugunde (welterweight) and George Cosby (middleweight) settled for bronze medals. Munuhe revealed that their participation in the AAG gave the team a chance to gauge their performance. He said their training has so far yielded results and they can only build up on the same in as far as their tactical and technical approach is concerned. Meanwhile, the boxers will compete in the local leagues starting next month as they await Olympic Qualifiers. “Focus has now shifted to the Olympic qualifiers early next year and we kick off our training in a month time or so. In the meantime, we will return to local league action," he noted Munuhe said their Morocco tour opened their eyes on a few things both tactical and technical and they hope to make improvements. " We have had a few challenges with speed work and getting our target right. We hope to work on that and I am hopeful we will qualify for the Olympics,” he added.
