 Two Dandora health centre nurses have been suspended for allegedly denying a pregnant woman access to the facility for refusing to pay Sh20 registration. The woman gave birth outside the health centre. All maternity services are cost-free across in public health facilities. County Health executive Mohammed Dagane visited the health centre on Tuesday and established that the woman was denied admission after she refused to pay the registration fee. "No one is supposed to be subjected to inhumane delivery experience in or outside our health facilities. Maternity services are free in all county facilities," Dagane stated. He said the nurses had been suspended until investigations are completed. Governor Mike Sonko said any health practitioner found to have disregarded their professional duty will be sacked. Just last month, a video of a woman giving birth on the floor as nurses at Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital sipped tea went viral on social media. The woman was lying on the floor with her baby wrapped in shuka.
