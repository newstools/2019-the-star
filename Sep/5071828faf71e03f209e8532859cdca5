 Homa Bay schools are financially constrained to effectively conduct the assessment of their Grade 3 learners. Headteachers said they had no resources to finance the downloading of assessment papers from cyber cafes. At Shauri Yako Primary School, 170 Grade 3 pupils are ready to be assessed. Headteacher John Omollo said it was costly to download the papers but they just managed to do so. The institution lost its computer and printer three weeks ago to burglars. “The theft was a setback to our institution because we now have to rely on the cyber,” Omollo said. Lake Primary School headteacher Erick Koyier had a similar complaint. The school has 102 Grade 3 learners. “We do not have machines to produce test papers. We had to depend on a local cyber to download them from the Kenya National Examinations Council website,” he said. Monica Odhiambo, the Nyalkinyi Primary school head said her institution has 33 learners to be assessed. She also complained of high cyper cafe costs.
