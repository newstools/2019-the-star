The perimeter wall of the Sh13.8 million Githongo Stadium collapsed on Saturday, putting the Meru administration on the spot. Abuthuguchi West MCA Patrick Muthuri expressed his shock "after learning that the wall is being constructed by unqualified people". “This is public money running into waste. Why has the contractor not displayed a signpost to show the ongoing construction as per the law?" Muthuri said. We do not know who the engineer is. I have complained before the start of its construction but my plea fell on deaf ears, Muthuri said. "The engineer should be arrested for threatening lives," he said. Muthuri said the substandard work at the stadium despite huge sums of money allocated must be investigated and culprits brought to book. On Wednesday, the contractor had begun reconstruction works on the collapsed side of the wall. “There are no toilets anticipated for construction. We have no changing rooms. I ask the EACC, public works office and county sports ministry to account for the projects. Residents want value for their money," the MCA said. He added, "I have heard those constructing the perimeter wall have never joined any masonry polytechnic. They are well known." He said his oversight role should not be misunderstood to be political. “Someone had told me there are demons within this field preventing proper construction. There are cracks on the wall,” he said. Githongo market chairman Peter Koome and secretary Peninah Mutwiri said they have tried to reach out to the contractor but he was nowhere to be found. Reached for comment, Deputy governor Titus Ntuchiu, who is also in charge of Finance, said he would reply shortly. Edited by R.Wamochie
