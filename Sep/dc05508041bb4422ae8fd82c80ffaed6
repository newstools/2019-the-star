Deaf Athletics Association of Kenya (DAAK) president Jones Kirui is elated with Team Kenya’s performance and he is looking forward to more medals today. “ I am very proud of the Kenyan athletes. Prior to the event, I urged them to take advantage of home soil and they have done exactly that.  I am hopeful we can collect more medals in the remaining events,” intimated Kirui. Team Kenya’s head coach Sammy Kibet projects that Kenya will finish at the top of the medal table with over 40 medals. He noted that the country has strong athletes in the remaining events. The tactician added that he is looking forward to a podium sweep in the men’s 3,000m steeplechase today and a half marathon tomorrow. In the water-and-barrier race, Kenya will be represented by Jacob Kibet, Henry Kipsang and Lucas Wandia. The trio will come up against Algerian Abdelwahid Zeghbib. John Koech claimed the men's 800m, clocking 1:57.95 as compatriot Rondi Francis timed 1:58.83 to claim the silver medal. Koech said he has shifted focus to the 1,500m set for tomorrow where he is keen on attacking the world record. “The 800m race was just to jump-start my body in preparation for my speciality (1,500m). I really don’t know the kind of competition I will face,” noted Koech. Other events set for today include men and women’s 400m, shot put (w), long jump (w), javelin (m) and discuss (w).
