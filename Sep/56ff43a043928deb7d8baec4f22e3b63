Former Boston Marathon champion Sharon Cherop returns to Ljubljana Marathon on October 27 seeking to improve on her performance. After finishing fourth in 2:25.05 during last year's race won by former Paris Marathon champion Visiline Jepkesho, Cherop said her focus is to run her best time and win the race after a long wait for a title. With Jepkesho competing for the country at the IAAF World Championships in Doha, Qatar, later this month, Cherop is expected to capitalise on the situation to bring the crown home. In an interview, the former world junior 5,000m bronze medallist said her focus will be to win the title. She said she was using Chemususu Marathon last weekend as a build-up for Ljubljana Marathon. “I came to Chemususu as part of my training for Ljubljana Marathon. Running at home gives me power and serves as a good training base. Remember, this is a hilly and hard course,” said Cherop. Cherop, who won Humburg Marathon in 2010, stated that her training has been good and achieving the best results will be great for her. Apart from making her name in marathon running, Cherop also won the Toronto Waterfront Marathon in 2010.
