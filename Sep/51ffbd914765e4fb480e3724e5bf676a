The Anti-Corruption Court has extended a warrant of arrest against two men who attempted to extort Sh30 million from Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi. The suspects pretended to be investigators from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. They asked for the money ostensibly to protect the governor from a corruption probe in the county. Senior principal magistrate Lawrence Mugambi extended the arrest warrant after the court was informed that suspects George Ngugi and Abdul Aziz Alim have not been arrested. Prosecutor Jennifer Kaniu applied for extension of the arrest warrant, saying police had not traced the two. Ngugi and Alim are charged alongside Moses Musee Maluki and Noah Akala Aduwo who have since pleaded not guilty to the charges and granted cash bail of Sh600,000. They are represented by lawyer Lewis Kanyoka. Kaniu said a letter addressed to the court from a Mombasa hospital did not disclose the ailment and treatment prescribed for Ngugi and Alim. She said their lawyer urged the court to defer plea taking three times to enable the suspects travel from Mombasa to Nairobi to answer to the charges against them but they have failed to comply with court directions. Mugambi said the defence had been given the opportunity to present the two suspects but they abused the goodwill extended to them on August 26. Ngugi,  Maluki and  Aziz have been charged separately with introducing themselves to  Ahmed Ibrahim, a liaison officer to  Kingi, as EACC officers investigating corruption in Kilifi county. The alleged offence was committed on June 20 last year at Gracia Hotel within Kilimani Area Nairobi City County.
