The Impala floodlights rugby tournament has received Sh3m sponsorship from Blaze by Safaricom, an increase from last year's Sh1.8m. Winners in the club competition will pocket Sh200,000 with the runner up going home with Sh80,000. Winners in the varsity category will go home with Sh60,000. The Blaze sponsorship includes Sh1m in cash and an additional Sh2m in airtime, trophies, pitch branding and a fully-kitted media centre. Safaricom chief executive, officer Michael Joseph said they were looking forward to an exciting event. “Blaze seeks to continuously inspire young Kenyans to pursue and excel in unconventional careers. By supporting our young sportsmen and women, we look forward to making Kenya a great hub of rugby talent through our G.R.I.T (Greatness Requires Internal Toughness) message,” said Joseph. Ahead of the September 28 – October 12, Impala chairman Bob Asiyo said: “Rugby requires a lot of stamina and many youths are increasingly actualising their dreams by taking part in this tournament." "Safaricom has for the last four years created opportunities for many and enabled us to discover and nurture talented players who eventually join the Kenya Cup League,” added Asiyo. Champions KCB are expected to defend the title they have won for the last three years with hosts Impala, Quins, Homeboyz, Menengai Oilers, Nakuru and Stanbic Mwamba among clubs expected to feature at the extravaganza. In the varsity category, Mean Machine, Strathmore Leos, Blak Blad, Catholic University of Eastern Africa and Egerton are expected. Asiyo noted that preparations are ongoing with the draw set for next week. "Preparations for the event are going on and we will do thee draw in due course,” he added. In 2018, the tournament attracted over 8,000 spectators with great sports talents on show. The tournament has run for 38 years.
