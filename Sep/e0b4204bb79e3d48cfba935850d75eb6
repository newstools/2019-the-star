The Kenya Urban Roads Authority will give a Sh100,000 reward to anyone who exposes those vanadalising public utilities. According to Kura's acting director general Silas Kinoti, for the past three months, more than 30 street poles worth Sh2.5 million have been vandalised in Nairobi county in an organised crime syndicate. "We wish to condemn this unscrupulous and barbaric behaviour which not only endangers the lives of road users but also renders the maintenance of roads expensive," he said on Tuesday. Some of the most affected roads include Thika Superhighway, Outering, Ngong and Langata roads. The road authority has appealed to the public to shame and expose those vandalising public utilities. Kinoti said the culture of vandalism has threatened residents' enjoyment of vital components of modern road infrastructure. Kinoti also said the government is investing over Sh300 billion each year for provision of road infrastructure intended to drive Vision 2030. Kura issued telephone numbers 020-272222 and 0717105233 for the public to report vandalism The public can also email info@kura.go.ke or report to the nearest police station.
