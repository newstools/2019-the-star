Billionaire Humphrey Kariuki will not be able to travel to the United States and Switzerland after the court set aside earlier orders directing the release of his passports. Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot on Tuesday said the application for the release of the passports was merited but should be made afresh before chief magistrate Francis Andayi, who handled the matter when the parties were first arraigned in court. Kariuki's case involves three files, which are being heard in different courts. Cheruiyot issued the directive after the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions raised the issue of the existence of two other case files and the different bond terms issued. Kariuki, through lawyer Cecil Miller, had urged the court to allow him to travel to the United States, Gabon and Switzerland for urgent business meetings or engagements between September 23 and September 27, October 12 and between November 26 and December 6. His Kenyan and Cypriot passports had been deposited in court when they were granted bail by Andayi. Kariuki was arraigned in court last month in connection with tax evasion claims, amounting to Sh41 billion.
