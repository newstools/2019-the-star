Kevin De Bruyne says he’s promised former Manchester City team-mate Vincent Kompany he’ll join him at Anderlecht when he eventually leaves the Etihad. Kompany was appointed player-manager of the Belgian first division club after calling time on an 11-year stay at City in June. City were expected to say a belated farewell to Kompany at his testimonial at the Etihad last night but De Bruyne says he hopes to link up with him again in the future. “I hope his career will be just as amazing at as it was at City,” he told The Sun. “I’ve told him to keep a place in his team for me in a year, or seven, when I’m finished here. “If he does do that for me I will already have my next destination lined up; my next job,” he said. “I will definitely miss him being around City.” De Bruyne told how Kompany became influential in him moving to City in a £54 million move from Wolfsburg four years ago. He recalled: “At the time City were trying to sign me from Wolfsburg and Vinny was pushing for me to move to Manchester to play alongside him. “He would constantly ask me when I was coming. He would say ‘you need to come’, constantly encouraging me to join City.”
