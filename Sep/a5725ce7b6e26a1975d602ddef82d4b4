Residents of Kavaari in Mbeere North subcounty are set to benefit from a Sh3.2 million earth dam. The 10,000 cubic metres earth dam will serve 120 needy households in the region. The water will be used for irrigation and domestic use. While reporting to County Development Implementation Coordination Committee, Upper Tana Natural Resources Management Project coordinator Agnes Muchira said Upper Tana has pumped Sh2.7 million to commence  construction. She said the project, which started in May this year, is 90 per cent complete and is expected to be fully done in two weeks. “Currently, the community is being served by Thura River, which is seasonal and only serves them for three months,” Muchira said. She said when the river dries up, the nearest water source is six kilometres away, meaning residents spend most of their time looking for water. “The dam is expected to resolve this problem by harvesting rainwater for use throughout the year. This will save time used to look for water and use in other economic activities,” she said. Embu county commissioner Abdulahi Galgalo said other government agencies and the county government are coming on board to ensure the lower regions of Embu, which experience perennial dry spells, are supplied with water for both domestic and irrigation use. Kavaari residents said the dam will end their water problems and will improve living standards. Resident Albert Njagi said residents have been living in pain as they walk long distances in search water.
