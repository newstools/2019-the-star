The Women’s Premier League encounter pitting defending champions Vihiga Queens and Makolanders planned for today at the Mumias Sports Complex has been rescheduled. According to Vihiga’s head coach Alex Alumira, the match was shelved after Makolanders failed to settle for a second opponent. Lack of funds has forced clubs in the women league to honour two away matches in a single weekend as a way of cutting costs. Makolanders, who are two places above the red line did not get a second opponent forcing the Football Kenya Federation competitions committee to postpone the match indefinitely unspecified date. Vihiga are joint league leaders with Trans Nzoia Falcons on 55 points. “We were looking to host them today but they did not get a second opponent thus the match was called off to a later date. The latest move does not impact negatively on our plans even though we fear one of the Trans-Nzoia strikers may be awarded goals in a controversial manner now that we will not be in action,” said Alumira. Other matches lined up for the weekend will see third-placed Gaspo Women seek to go top when they accost Wadadia at Mumias. Gaspo have amassed 54 points and a win will catapult them past the duo of Trans-Nzoia and Vihiga. Gaspo will later travel to play Kisumu All Starlets at the Moi Stadium Kisumu the following day. Fifth-ranked Oserian will play Thika Queens at Thika Stadium while Eldoret Falcons will take on Zetech Sparks at Eldoret University grounds.
