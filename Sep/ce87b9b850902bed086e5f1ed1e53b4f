Parents have been urged to teach their children good morals so that they do not bring shame to the community in the future. Thiong’o Gitau, who was installed as Kikuyu King last Saturday at Nyamweru Secondary School, said he will start speaking to young people on the value of hard work and self-reliance so that they can become more responsible. He said there are a lot of cases where schools are set ablaze by students, lack of respect for elders, use of vulgar language and a rise in theft. Gitau said this is caused by lack of counselling among other issues. The king who spoke at his Raini Njeke home yesterday, called upon churches to add more counselling sessions for Sunday school children and the youth. Gitau, who is the retired chief of Githirioni, said if children are brought up well,  then good morals can be instilled in them easily so that they can become respectable members of the community. “It is unfortunate that in a village full of people of all ages, you cannot find someone to speak on their behalf because no one is presentable, respectable or even speak in a language that is acceptable by the community,” he said. “We need to share qualities of leadership with our children and our neighbours. That way, we can get the best out of us,” he said.
