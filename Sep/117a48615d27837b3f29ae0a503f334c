President Uhuru Kenyatta has said despite being in a patriarchal society, his government has made significant strides to attain gender equality. Uhuru added that his government had succeeded in enrolling the highest number of women to Cabinet and they lead dockets previously held by men. His speech was read by Sports CS Amina Mohammed. Amina was speaking during the opening of the Commonwealth Women's Affairs Ministers Meeting in Nairobi on Thursday. The meeting began on Monday and will end on Friday. The Countess of Wessex Sophie Helen Rhys-Jones said to realise the women peace security agenda, it is important to move to action and implementation. She encouraged increased participation of women in leadership, education and economic empowerment opportunities. Commonwealth Secretary General Patricia Scotland said it is time to plan, strategize and implement if the future of women is to be better than the best. "If we don't get gender equality... we will not be able to deliver on our Sustainable Development Goals," she said. Cabinet Secretary Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs said women economic empowerment is the determinant. "We must reflect to see which development agenda has the most impact and costs the least to implement," she said. Kobia said poverty takes away the dignity of women.
