The late Ken Okoth wife Monica Okoth has disputed the DNA results produced in court that confirmed Nairobi MCA Anne Thumbi's son was sired by late Kibra MP. Monica on Wednesday said she has different DNA results. The court has directed she produce her results within the next 14 days. Earlier this month, three DNA tests results confirmed that Thumbi's son was sired by Okoth. KEMRI confirmed that the chances of Okoth being the father of Thumbi's son were 99.99 per cent. Thumbi had moved to court to have Okoth's family recognise her son as his and involve him in burial arrangements. Last month, the nominated MCA told the Star that she was ready to take a DNA test to prove that her five-year-old son was sired by the late MP. Ann had moved to court through her lawyer Elkana Mogaka suing Okoth's mum Angeline Okoth and wife Monica Okoth along with Lee funeral home. She wanted her son to be recognised as Okoth's son before the send-off.
