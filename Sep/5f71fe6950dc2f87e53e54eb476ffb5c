Former Kasarani MP John Njoroge began his defence in a Sh100,000 bribery case on Wednesday will a plea to be acquited citing lack of evidence. His lawyer Kiraithe Wandungi told  Anti-Corruption Court senior principal magistrate Lawrence Mugambi that the case was politically motivated. The former legislator has previously denied pocketing a Sh100,000 bribe to facilitate payment from Sh3.3 million from the CDF kitty on June 4, 2013. The money was pocketed from Abdirahman Abdullahi. The bribe was to facilitate payment for the completion of a tuition block at Baba Dogo Secondary School. Abdullahi said the MP also demanded another Sh50,000 in bribe for  CDF committee officials to share for facilitating the payment. Abdullahi told the court that he reported the matter to EACC who laid the trap through which the lawmaker was arrested at the parking at Continental House. Ndirangu had two years ago been acquited by previous magistrate Peter Ndwiga after Abdullahi dropped his complaint. But the DPP appealed and the High Cout directed the trial to continue. Mugambi on Wednesday adjourned the case to September 19.
