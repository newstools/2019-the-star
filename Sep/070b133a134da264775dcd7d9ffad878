Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga on Tuesday said Homa Bay Women Sacco is not her personal property but has got registered members to run it. Wanga said more than 10,000 registered members are guided by a constitution, which they passed during the last annual general meeting. Wanga has been on the receiving end from individuals who have failed to repay their loans and whose property have been auctioned. They accuse the lawmaker ofÂ  running the Sacco as personal property. "I'm just but the patron of the members who decided to join the Sacco. My main duty is to look for funds. I have no control of how it is being run or managed," she said. "Take, for instance, a father, a mother and two children owe the Sacco over Sh1 million and they have completely refused to pay. Does it add to corruption or mismanagement if their properties are auctioned by members so others can also get an opportunity to borrow their money?" The MP has secured Sh10 million from the Women Enterprise Fund to boost the members' saving. She hit out at those opposing the initiative, saying most politicians are afraid of taking such risks for fear of failing, which "they think might lead to the end of their political lives". "The Sacco will be there even if I'm not in politics. I want to leave a legacy for our women to remember me with even if I'm gone," she told the Star on the phone. "The initiative is somehow challenging but it's a step of faith. It's not an easy task but we must soldier on." The Sacco has won awards during Mashirika celebrations as the most progressive Sacco in Homa Bay. Wanga has promised to continue supporting women and youths to ensure that their incomes rise. Women from 80 markets have benefitted from Sh15.1 million Abedo grant funds to promote their small businesses. (Edited by F'Orieny)
