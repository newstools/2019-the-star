Kenyans extended their dominance at the ongoing inaugural Africa Deaf Athletics Championships as Jacob Kibet led compatriots to a medal sweep in the men's 3,000m steeplechase final at Moi Stadium, Kasarani yesterday. This is Kenya's third podium sweep in the championships following other stellar performances in men's 10,000m and women's 200m. Kibet won the water-and-barrier race in 9:15.90. Lucas Wandia was second in 9:15.91 as Henry Kipsang sealed the medal bracket in 9:44.71. The hosts' closest challenger was Algerian Abdelwahd Zeghabib who completed the race in 10:51.86. Kibet said: "I am happy all the medals in my race have remained in Kenya. Given our numbers, it was not as competitive as I would have wanted. I must thank God for strength. Gold would have slipped through my fingers if I never had the energy to sprint in the last 50m" "Wandia was running hot on my heels so I had to push myself harder and I got the reward." Kilifi-based Simon Meza claimed the pole position in men's 400m finals by timing 49.42. Meza, a class eight pupil at Kibarani School for the Deaf said he had his focus on finishing the race and he found it easy that way. Isaac Atima crossed the line in 49.84 to bag the bronze medal after Nigeria's Olaniyan Temitope timed 49.67 to spoil the Kenyan party. "I won my heat so I was confident I will replicate that feat in the finals. The final was an easy one. I had trained very well ahead of this championships so I anchored my confidence on that. When the light flash, I concentrated my efforts on finishing the race," noted the 21-year-old Meza, who trains with his father. Linet Nanjala grabbed in her second medal of the championships when she won the women's 400m final. After settling for the silver medal on in the women's 200m finals, Nanjala clocked 1:00.48 to grab a gold medal. Her compatriot Ruth Awuor was second after she stopped her watch in 1:00.80 as Nigerian Assurance Omoira timed 1:01.18 for the third.
