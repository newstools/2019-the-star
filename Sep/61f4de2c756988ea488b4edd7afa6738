Two university unions have called for the resignation of the Maasai Mara University vice chancellor over allegations of corruption. The Kenya Universities Staff Union and the University and Academic Staff Union termed Prof Mary Walingo is unfit to occupy public office. This follows an expose that ran on a local TV station, putting her at the centre of abuse of office and embezzlement of public funds in the institution. Uasu secretary general Constantine Wasonga on Tuesday asked Walingo to step aside to allow for investigations. Kusu secretary general Charles Mukhwaya said the professor, who is accused of presiding over runaway graft at the institution, fails to inspire confidence and should step aside until she is cleared by investigating authorities. "She demonstrated that she will go an extra mile to have staff standing on her gravy train route harmed," he said. The expose put Walingo at the centre of the scandal, which might have led to the loss of over Sh190 million at the university in Narok county. The unions also called for the dissolution of the university council to protect public resources. They argued that some members of the council have become the vice chancellorâ€™s trojan horses for the plunder of resources. Kusu leaders also called for mandatory vetting of all public university VCs, saying public university councils have become an avenue for them to plunder public resources. Edited by R.Wamochie
