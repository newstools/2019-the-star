A Facebook post claiming that President Uhuru Kenyatta has signed the Copyright (Amendment) 2019 Bill into law is TRUE. The post further adds that the law aims to address concerns about intellectual property rights, collection of licencing fees and the disbursement of royalties to copyright owners. The bill amends the Copyright Act of 2001, and was introduced in Parliament in 2017 to address concerns over royalty rights in the country, especially the collection and disbursement of fees and dues to copyright holders. The bill was passed by the National Assembly, with amendments, on July 25, 2018. A post on the website of the Presidency as well as a tweet posted on September 18 by State House Kenya indicates that President Kenyatta signed two bills into law — the Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2019 and the County Allocation of Revenue Bill, 2019. The Copyright Act established the Kenya Copyright Board as a State Corporation, and provides protection for musical, literary, artistic and audiovisual works. PesaCheck has looked into the claim that President Kenyatta has signed the Copyright (Amendment) 2019 Bill into law and finds it to be TRUE.
