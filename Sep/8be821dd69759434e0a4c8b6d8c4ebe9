Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko's firstborn daughter Saumu Mbuvi has revealed that her baby daddy Ben Gatu was violent. Gatu, a businessman-cum-politician, schooled with Saumu at JKUAT and were close friends before they took it to another level. In an interview with Massawe Japanni on Radio Jambo, Saumu said, "We started as friends and dated for nine months and we broke up when I was heavily pregnant. He used to beat me and after sharing with friendsd I went to my dad and told him 'I couldn't take it more. I know I've wronged you,' and he accepted me back as a father." "I was young and naive. I rushed to get married. I got into a relationship with Gatu after graduating. I wouldn't advise women to be in a toxic relationship, which will drag you emotionally. Don't allow violence in a relationship." Saumu is raising her daughter alone and advised single women to remarry. "I wouldn't advise women to stay single after they break up with their baby daddies. Look for a father figure. A dad is very important in every child's life," Saumu adds. She said she's lucky to have a father figure for her child. "My lover right now (Senator Anwar Loitiptip) is a very amazing father to my daughter," Saumu said. Saumu's mother passed away when she was 14. "She died from Meningitis. I was in Class 8, waiting to sit for my KCPE examination," she said. Saumu them moved to Nairobi to live with her father and stepmother Primrose Mbuvi. Talking about the Nairobi Country first lady, she said, "She is a good mother. She has been there for me. When I came to Nairobi she took me in as her own daughter. She's a good woman." She said that at the time her mother passed, she and her father Sonko were co-parenting.
