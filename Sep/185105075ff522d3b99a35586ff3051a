Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has said that the Sh20 million traced to his account by EACC  was from businesses he engaged in before he became the county chief. The governor has been accused of pocketing the Sh20 million from a lucrative garbage collection contract for 2017-18 and 2018-19. Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission detectives claim that some of the firms that won the Sh357 million tender wired more than Sh20 million to Sonko’s bank accounts. Sonko on Thursday denied engaging in corruption. "I would never touch a coin from the public," he said. He also said the county has paid all its taxes, except for the amount inherited from former Governor Evans Kidero's regime. Sonko said,"Currently we don't have a problem. We have paid more than Sh5 billion in taxes. The problem that has arisen is from the previous regime." He said his government is yet to remit about Sh50 million from this month's salary to city workers. The governor was interrogated on Tuesday for eight hours at Integrity Centre, where he recorded 13 different statements.
