A team from Kenya Revenue Authority met Nairobi county officials to discuss the accrued withholding taxes totalling Sh5.8 billion. The meeting came after an application made by KRA on Wednesday requiring the entire county top leadership to appear before them. Governor Mike Sonko, County Executive in Charge of Finance Charles Kerich, Chief Officer for Finance Halkano Waqo and the Acting County Secretary Leboo Morintat attended the meeting held on Friday. It was noted that some of the tax arrears were accrued during the previous county government's leadership. KRA said that tax arrears comprise PAYE, Withholding Income Tax and Withholding VAT. Sonko's team asked the taxman to be allowed to immediately make part payment of the amount due as a show of good faith in their attempt to regularise all their tax matters. The governor had earlier appeared before the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission over tender irregularities. The investigations were initiated after the county assembly’s Public Accounts Committee revealed that officials at City Hall’s Environment department could not account for more than Sh160 million that was paid to companies contracted to collect garbage. As a result, director of investigations Abdi Mohamud wrote to the governor summoning him to Integrity Centre last Friday. The governor has said that he is ready to bear his own cross if he is found guilty, including stepping aside as Nairobi governor in order to allow the investigation team to carry out their exercise.
