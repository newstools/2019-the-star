Windsor resident professional Rizwan Charania was in a class of his own as Uganda Open Gold Championship entered hallway stage at the Lake Victoria Serena Resort and Spa. Five birdies, four in the front nine and three in the back nine, saw the former Professional Golfers of Kenya chairman move up to the fourth place. After a disappointing 2 over par 75 on Day 1, Charania wrapped up day tied in fourth with Breyten Meyer of South Africa with a gross total of -2. Charania shot a scintillating 5 over par 67. Other Kenyans in the money bracket are Mohit Meddiratta of Sigona on T8 with Stephen Feeairra of Zimbabwe. Edwin Mudanyi is tying in 13th place after round two with Royal Nairobi’s Eric Ooko on T17. Speaking on phone from Kampala, Charania said: “I had some help on putting this week from a friend and this made all the difference as that’ has always been my weakness. In Round 3 and 4, I will continue to be aggressive. My swing and putts are pretty good now,” said Charania. Zambian Madalitso Muthiya has taken the lead of the event after a round of 68 which now places him on a three-shot lead ahead of Zim pro-Charamba Tongoona. Madalitso leads the pack with a gross total of -6. Yesterday’s round also decided the cut for the top 32 players. Among those making the cut were youngster Mathew Wahome, Sujan Shah, CJ Wangai and Njuguna Ngugi of Nyali among others. Top Kenyan pros Greg Snow, Kopan Timbe and Dismas Indiza found the going tough but still made the cut tied for 23rd. Kenya’s best in Round One Justus Madoya also made the cut after he dipped to T17. Madoya played a disappointing round of +6 after five double bogeys on both nines.
