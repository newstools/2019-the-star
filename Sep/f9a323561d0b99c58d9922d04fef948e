A woman was on Tuesday charged in a Meru court with refusing to give data to census officials. Linda Gakii, 29, was accused of declining to be counted. She allegedly told the officials she did not want to be involved in the exercise because the questions were irrelevant. Gakii pleaded not guilty to the charge before chief resident magistrate Hannah Ndung'u. The court heard that on August 30 in Meru township, the accused willfully failed to give information regarding her family to an enumerator collecting statistical information for the 2019 census. Prosecutor Antony Musyoka said Gakii failed to give information to an authorised person, Daisy Kanana, contrary to the Statistic Act 2006. Musyoka said Kanana visited Gakii's homestead on two occasions but she refused to be counted. "The accused locked her house and left for Gakoromone market despite being explained to the need to be counted during the census exercise," the prosecutor said. Kanana returned to Gakii’s home with his supervisor Nicholus Gatobu but she refused t give details. The two officials informed chief Mercy Murithi who arrested the accused with the help of police officers. The court granted the accused a Sh50,000 bail. Ndung'u directed the case be mentioned on September 9 before hearing on October 8. Earlier in the same court, two men were fined Sh10,000 for touting. edited by peter obuya
