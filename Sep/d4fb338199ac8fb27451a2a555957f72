Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ng'eno has been arrested for allegedly inciting Mau forest settlers not to move out of their farms. Ng’eno who was in the company of his Chepalungu counterpart Gideon Koske and over 15 MCAs, were on their way to visit the affected families but the security officers had barricaded the leading to the area. The leaders opted to use boda bodas to access the area. In a video seen by the Star, the police officers are seen roughing up MP Koske as he was trying to free Ng’eno. Ng'eno is currently being transferred to Narok Police station for questioning. The eviction of Mau settlers has taken political angle even as President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have remained mum on the matter. Already the National Assembly has cautioned Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko to ensure that that there is public participation and engagement with local leaders of the affected communities.
