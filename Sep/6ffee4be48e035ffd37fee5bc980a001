Hosts Kakamega Homebyz extended their excellent home record against AFC Leopards after registering a deserved 1-0 win in a tough and entertaining Kenyan Premier League match played at Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega County yesterday. The hosts, under the tutelage of Nicholas Muyoti, started strongly with Allan Wanga, Ali Bhai and Steven Etyang proving very dangerous to visitors' porous backline winning the first corner as early as the fourth minute. However, their pressure remained unfruitful as Moses Chikati's header from the corner went over the bar. Homeboyz defender Kennedy Onyongo saw his free header hit the top corner of the post with David Odhiambo, skewing the rebound with Benjamin Ochan already beaten. As the first half progressed Leopards settled into the match with Malian international Ismail Diarra seeing his shot inside the box being blocked by Homeboyz defender George Odiwour. Immiadetely after the breather, the hosts' winger, Peter Thiongâ€™o, made a powerful run on the right-wing before releasing an inviting cross that found Odhiambo inside the box but he was not precise with his effort as it went wide. Leopards fate was sealed in the 83rd minute after Christopher Masinza, who came in for a tired Allan Wanga, spotted an unmarked Etyang at the edge of the box and served him with a delicious cross which he made good use to beat Ochan. Excited Homeboyz coach Muyoti was happy to stick one past his former team as he praised Etyang and the rest of the players. His opposite number, Casa Mbungo blamed the loss on lack of gelling amongst his players.
