Sarova Hotels & Resorts has announced its plan to cease management of the Spirit of the Masai Mara starting November. In a press statement sent to newsrooms on Wednesday, the hotel said the move follows a mutual agreement between the lodge owners and Sarova Hotels. Sarova Hotels Managing Director, Jimi Kariuki in the statement said from November 1, the property will no longer be a member of the Sarova Hotels Signature Collection brand. Sarova took over management of the lodge located within the Siana Conservancy in the Maasai Mara in April 2018. According to the statement, Spirit of the Masai Mara will continue to focus on wildlife conservation in close cooperation with the World Wildlife Fund. “The agreement to discontinue Sarova’s management of the lodge is mutual between us and the lodge owners, the McCarthy family,”  Kariuki said. “Sarova will continue to have a strong presence in the Masai Mara Game Reserve through our tented lodge Sarova Mara Game Camp.” He dispelled fears that with the move, the agreement will affect any of the current Spirit of the Masai Mara employees. “Sarova employees who were deployed to Spirit of the Masai Mara will be retained by Sarova Hotels and employees of Spirit of the Masai Mara will be retained by the lodge,” he said. Kariuki said Sarova Hotels, through their Central Reservations Office in Nairobi will continue to manage all bookings for the lodge up to October 31, 2019. According to him, for all future bookings and correspondence, Spirit of the Masai Mara can be reached at info@spiritofthemasaimara.com. Spirit of the Masai Mara consists of 10 solidly built air-conditioned suites, uniquely blending modern design and traditional building materials. Its suite comprises of a large lounge with a private bar, spacious bedroom and beautiful bathroom with tub and shower.
