Barcelona players are reportedly unhappy with how the club apparently offered several of them to PSG to try and complete a move for Neymar. According to Marca, Barcelona’s squad were in favour of Neymar’s return but several players have been unsettled by being offered up to PSG to entice them to the negotiating table. Players such as Ousmane Dembele, Ivan Rakitic, Nelson Semedo, Arturo Vidal and Jean-Clair Todibo were all mooted to make up part of a deal to sign Neymar. Barcelona are widely expected to return with a fresh bid for Neymar and Spanish media reported on Tuesday that the striker wants to try and get back to the Nou Camp in the January window. The Catalan side had to offer players to meet PSG’s terms after spending big on another striker in Antoine Griezmann. He arrived from Atletico Madrid in a deal worth around £108m (Sh13.7bn).
