Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro has astonishingly admitted the team need to make improvements all over the pitch after their underwhelming draw at Villarreal. Zinedine Zidane’s men twice trailed but Gareth Bale struck back both times to ensure Madrid did not walk away empty-handed. The result leaves Madrid with just one victory from their three opening La Liga games and Casemiro admitted that it is not acceptable. On Sunday’s performance, the Brazilian said: “We are lacking everything. We have to score goals and be better defensively. This is a team. If we defend, we all defend. If we attack, we all attack.” The 27-year-old added: “Real Madrid are obliged to win, always, this jersey makes it an obligation. This is a complicated place to play. We had control for 65 minutes but they got into it and scored.” “This is the way forward, a draw and keeping adding points. The international break is here and we can change our mindset. You have to keep working. We had control. We had opportunities. I think that we played well but with this jersey, you always have to win.” ‘It’s normal [to be criticised] but people have to see the work we do. You have to keep working to get as far as we can in La Liga.” Zidane’s men don’t play in the league again until September 14, against Levante, before their Champions League campaign gets underway away at Paris Saint-Germain four days later.
