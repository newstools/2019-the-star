The African elephant is now more protected than ever before, Tourism CS Najib Balala has said. "We now want to implement the African Elephant Action Plan and need support to the African Elephant Fund for Kenya and other African countries," Balala said. The CS spoke on Tuesday at the Kenya Wildlife Service headquarters ivory burning site on the outcome of the August 16-28 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The Kenyan delegation to the CITES was led by Tourism CAS Joseph Boinnet. It responded to the extinction crisis by strengthening international trade regime for wildlife. Around 25,000 plant species and 5,000 animal species are covered by the provisions of the convention. More than 130 species were listed for the first time under CITES. CITES is an international agreement between governments that aim is to ensure international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. Kenya presented eight agenda items five on species listing and three on the revision of resolutions for better implementation of the provisions of the convention. A joint proposal by  Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe and backed up by South Africa to trade in their ivory stockpiles was voted down by 81 per cent. This was after a spirited fight put up by Kenya with support from the African Elephant Coalition, the EU, USA, Latin American and Caribbean States and other countries. "This in effect means the international trade ban in ivory continues to remain in place," Balala said.        Balala said 57 species listing proposals and over 100 working documents were being considered. "The 57 proposals presented over 500 species to be considered for protection through the regulation of international trade in their specimens," Balala said. He said nine species of animals were offered increased protection from international trade through listing in Appendix I. Species listed in Appendix I are threatened by extinction and as such, trade in specimens of these species is permitted only in exceptional circumstances. Those in Appendix II include species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but whose trade must be controlled for their survival.  CITES was signed in Washington D.C. on March 3, 1973, and entered into force on July 1, 1975. Currently, there are 183 parties, Kenya being one of them. Balala said the draft resolutions focused on providing a better interpretation for the implementation of the convention. This, he said, is by providing for enhanced control of trade in elephant ivory and rhino horns and calling for the closure of ivory and rhino horn markets, and better management of the horn stockpiles. "Our proposals to transfer Pancake tortoise from Appendix II to I and to list giraffes, wedge fish and teat fish in Appendix II were overwhelmingly passed," Balala said. Decisions of the conference on the species listing will enter into force for full implementation by all parties on November 26.  Noting that giraffes have declined by 36-40 per cent over the past three decades due to habitat loss and other pressures, the conference added the animal to Appendix II. There are nine different subspecies of giraffe, three of which are found in Kenya. These are the reticulated giraffe also known as the Somali giraffe whose populations are 15,524, Rothschild’s giraffe (609) and the Masai giraffe also known as the Kilimanjaro giraffe (12,717). All three sub-species are facing increased threats of poaching for bushmeat and other parts for both domestic and international market. Edited by R.Wamochie
