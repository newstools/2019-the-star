More than 400,000 pupils in Grade 3 have started their Competency-Based Curriculum assessment test. During an inspection tour of the progress of the exercise, which started on Tuesday, Eastern regional director of education Patrick Khaemba said the assessment would gauge the performance of certain tasks. “Unlike in the past, where we relied on written tests, the CBC assessment focuses on evaluating the learners' ability to perform certain tasks,” he said. Khaemba said the CBC assessment has created anxiety among teachers and learners. He said he saw learners tasked with improvisation of wheelbarrows and aprons but noted they are not competing for positions. “There is a misconception that one can learn only when tested through writing and ranking,” he said. Iveche Primary School headteacher Joyce Njamiu said CBC has made learning interesting, leading to a rise in enrolment and learners are already identifying talent. “The enrolment of the school has increased by five per cent, and we are receiving learners who have been transferred from private schools,” Njamiu said. She said that the use of improved materials makes it interesting and cheaper for parents.
