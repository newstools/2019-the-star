Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko said on Thursday through his Facebook page that he will stay away from his main office to avoid being accused of interfering with the official records that can be used as evidence against him. Sonko said that he was ready to step aside to allow the investigation to probe him if he is found guilty. This comes two weeks after he was linked to irregularities in the award of a garbage collection contract. "I'm on record promising to step aside if I will be found to have a case to answer on any of the allegations under investigations touching on Nairobi County," Sonko said. Sonko said that he has no tolerance for corruption. "As Nairobi City County Governor, I stand out for two main things: I do not shy away from controversy and I always walk the talk on zero tolerance on corruption!" the statement read. The governor said that he did not fear EACC and availed himself for questioning. "I could have allowed throngs of my supporters to accompany me to EACC," he said. " I insisted on going there alone based on my belief that everyone should carry his own cross and the summons were directed to me in my capacity as the Governor of Nairobi and not the people" He said that the reason why he has been silent in the two weeks since he was questioned was that he did not want to interfere with EACC investigations. He warned county staff whom he said thought he would step down. Sonko added that he was going to appoint his deputy governor after the County Government Amendment Bill is forwarded to the President for signing.
