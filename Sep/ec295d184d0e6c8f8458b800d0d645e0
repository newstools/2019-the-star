Relegation worries have hit United States International University after succumbing to a 57-55 defeat against University of Nairobi Dynamites at their own backyard. A concerned Flames coach Cliff Owuor said the turn of events was a serious drawback to their fight against relegation but promised to continue working hard to avoid the drop. “This was a crucial match for our survival in the Premier League but we did not turn up to play at all. We were sluggish and lacked energy. I must work hard to escape relegation,” said Owuor. He said they will work hard in training starting this week to ensure the two-time national champions survive the drop. The home team took a 27-22 lead at the breather and seemed to be on course for a win before UoN turned the tables. Valery Kemunto led the scoring tally by 18 points and Faith Atieno made 11. Linnsey Wanyonyi scored 13 and Jemimah Omondi hit 10. It was double gloom for the institution as their men’s side, who are also battling relegation, went down 53-48 to Umoja. Owuor, who also handles the successful national side says the Tigers now have a tough road to travel to save their top tier status. USIU were ahead 26-22 at half time and like their women counterparts, collapsed when it mattered. Nick Ogol hit 19 and Michael Munene shot 11. Ariel Ortega led the losers scoring tally by nailing 13 points but it was not enough to save their blushes. USIU have managed only two wins. “We were under a lot of pressure and this win gives us a push for a better position when we travel to Kisumu this weekend to face Lakeside,” said Umoja coach Steve Kuta. “Our focus was to secure a play-offs slot that we have made. Now we will play for a much better position in our remaining matches,” he noted. In the lower division Coastal Kings lost the second game gong down 88-72 to Kenya Christian Industrial Training Institute.
