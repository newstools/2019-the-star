People who traveling using public service vehicles along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway have complained of matatu’s breaking traffic rules. They allege that the PSV’s were overloading them, overlapping whenever there is an incident on the road, because there were no traffic police officers manning the highway. The most affected area is from Kinale area in Lari constituency in Kiambu county up to Kangemi area in Nairobi. Residents of Lari, Limuru, Kikuyu and Kabete who living long that route, are now urging Inpector General of police Hillary Mutyambai to reconsider withdrawing them traffic police from manning the road and inspecting vehicles especially the PSV’s. “If you are moving Kimende up to Limuru, you will not see any traffic police. This is the major highway in the country. There were four passengers in all seats instead of three of a 14-seater matatu, ending up in carrying about 19 or 20” said Jecinta Gathoni, a Kimende resident. Gathoni adds that if Mutyambai has directed commanders to decide where and when to place check up points and roadblocks, then they should consider returning several in that region since issues might get out of hand especially in the PSV sector. “The worst thing is that touts are so rude ," she added. According to a police source at the headquarters, the traffic police were directed to be attending to accidents only. A circular issued to the police stations, the traffic police were directed to be on standby at their offices to attend cases involving traffic being reported. However, residents also urged Mutyambai to reconsider the decision since whenever accidents, some idlers rob victim their valuables instead of assisting them. “We have witnessed few cases of accidents where victims are robbed if the police were far. If they were patrolling the highway, no is robbed since they arrive on time and people will ill motive do not get a chance” said Njoroge Wanjihia from Kinale.
