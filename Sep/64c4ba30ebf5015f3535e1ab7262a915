A former presidential hopeful has been charged with stealing NTV journalist Kenneth Mijunguâ€™s car. Justus Juma is accused of stealing the vehicle valued at Sh5.6 million with another suspect still at large in Nairobi on June 13. In a second count, the accused is charged with conspiracy to commit a felony. Juma wanted to vie for president in 2017 but his papers were rejected by IEBC. He denied the charges before chief magistrate Martha Mutuku and was released on a Sh800,000 cash bail. Apart from being a news anchor, Mijungu runs a company called Execar-tive CarHire which imports cars and machinery. About two months ago the news anchor appealed to the public to help him trace a stolen car. The anchor took to his Twitter account to announce that the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado VX had been stolen. The matter will be mentioned on October 23.
