A group of civil society organisations wants Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong'o's administration to involve residents in development and projects implementation to avoid conflicts. Head of Grassroots Trust Lawrence Apiyo said public participation is crucial in county governance and projects implementation and county leadership must fully promote it. Apiyo said residents should be part of development plans as they are affected either positively or negatively. “We want to see county government embracing dialogue with the locals. They understand best the projects that can uplift their living standards as well as cost implication,” he said. Apiyo spoke during a meeting in Kisumu, which brought together various civil society groups to discuss housing and city cleanliness. He said a lack of public engagement with the people will lead to developments that are not people-driven. Apiyo said it is only prudent to prioritise programmes needed by residents. The plan to set up new housing units on estates such as Arina and Ondiek should not be done without proper consultation with current tenants, he said. Jane Anyango, the coordinator of Polycom Development Project in Kibra slum, Nairobi, said the county must involve residents in every project. She said the recent demolition of structures in Kisumu was done without giving adequate time to the affected traders. Proper plans for alternative spaces for those to be affected have to be in place to enable them to resume their normal life, she said. Hundreds of traders whose shops were demolished are yet to be resettled by the county government. The majority of those affected have been left jobless. “We are not opposing development, but it must be done in consultation with the public to avoid cases of property loss,” Anyango added. She noted that several traders lost their livelihoods in the demolition but with adequate time, affected people are always prepared on their next cause of action. Edited by R.Wamochie
