@robertomollo3 Officials in Homa Bay have ordered the closure of a private primary school in the area citing poor infrastructure. In an impromptu visit led by county commissioner Herman Shambi, officials said Sodea School was unfit for learning. They said the school lacked enough latrines, did not have access to clean water, had dusty and uncemented classrooms. The one latrine available was being shared by both boys and girls. The school started operations in 2015 and has a population of 203 pupils, including learners from pre-primary to Standard 6. The school has nine teachers. Shambi said the poor infrastructure was exposing pupils to health risks. “It is unfortunate that pupils scramble for only one toilet. This can endanger their lives,” Shambi said. The commissioner said it was shocking that the school was registered with the Ministry of Education. “The fact that the institution is unregistered indicates that it does not meet the threshold.” An Early Year Education tutor was found to be teaching pupils in Standard 4. “I recommend to the Ministry of Education that this school be closed down,” Shambi said. The administrator accused school owners of going after money instead of considering the welfare of children. He said government officials will conduct random inspections across more schools and take appropriate action on those that do not meet requirements. Area education director Jacob Wanyama said the school was non-existent. “We are waiting for a directive from the ministry headquarters because we had written a report about this school,” Wanyama said.  edited by peter obuya
