World 5,000 metres champion Hellen Obiri faces a stiff test in the Diamond League final in Brussels on Friday. Obiri has had an inconsistent season on the circuit, winning the 3000m season opener in Doha in 8:25.60 in May. She came home 12th in Stockholm in 15:07:70 in the 5000m, ranked sixth at the Prefontaine Classic in the 3000m, where she timed 8:27.26 and won the 5,000m event in London in July where she clocked 14:20.26 She will have world 10,000m bronze medallist Agnes Tirop for the company alongside World Under-20 5000m champion Beatrice Chebet and World 3000m steeplechase record holder Beatrice Chepkoech. Others in the 12-lap race include Eva Cherono, Margaret Chelimo and Caroline Kipkirui. Dutch Hassan Sifan, who is currently enjoying top form, will provide a litmus test for the Kenyans in the event together with Great Britain's Eilish Mcolgan and Germany's  Konstanze Klosterhalfen. Fresh from winning the All Africa Games last week in Rabat, Ben Kigen will be hoping to reproduce similar form in the Belgian capital. Kigen will have world and Olympic 3000m steeplechase champion Conseslus Kipruto to contend with. Kipruto, who sustained a hip injury last month,  dropped out of the All African Games final last week. Nicholas Kiptanui, Abraham Kibiwott and Wilberforce Kones are the other Kenyan challengers. The Kenyan quartet will though have to deal with the challenge of Moroccan Soufianne El Bakkali, Ethiopia's Beyo Chala and compatriot Getnet Wale. World 1,500m silver medallist Timothy Cheruiyot leads a top-quality field over the distance In the absence of World and Commonwealth Games champion Elijah Manangoi, Cheruiyot starts as a favourite and will have Bethwell Birgen, Vincent Kibet, Boaz Kipkurgat, Timothy Sein and Charles Simotwo for company. Djibouti's Ayanleh Souleiman, Ronald Musagala of Uganda, Ethiopia's Samuel Tefera and Norwegian siblings Filip and Jakob Ingrebrigsten will be the other big names watch. Peter Kiprotich will be the sole Kenyan entrant in the 5000m and will battle it out against Ethiopia's Aba Gashahun and Ben True of the United States.
