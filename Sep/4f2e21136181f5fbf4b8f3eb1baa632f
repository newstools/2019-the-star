Knut chairman Wycliffe Omuchenyi has been directed to appear in court on October 8 after he defied an order allowing Wilson Sossion to remain as secretary general. Employment and Labor Relations judge Hellen Wasilwa on Tuesday found that Omuchenyi and the Registrar of Trade Unions were in contempt of court orders issued on August 28. She said the two should appear in court to explain why they should not be punished. On August 28, Judge Byrum Ongaya stopped Knut’s national executive council  from convening, attending or proceeding with a meeting scheduled for August 29 allegedly to remove Sossion. But Sossion's deputy Hesborn Otieno swore an affidavit saying on August 29 Knut through the meeting of NEC resolved to expel Sossion in accordance with the union's constitution. The resolution was passed by all the 29 NEC members at the meeting. Court documents show NEC made the decision based on Sossion’s questionable conduct like issuing strike notices without a resolution and sacking and sending on compulsory leave full time employees without consulting NEC. He was also accused of refusal to execute decisions of NEC arrived at various meetings and employing permanent staff without consulting NEC. Sossion challenged NEC’s move and temporarily obtained an order from Justice Wasilwa reinstating him. Sossion argued that only the annual delegates conference in December can remove him from office. The delegates will decide on allegations raised against him.
