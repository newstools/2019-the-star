The recent expose dubbed ‘Mara Heist’ is just a glimpse of the financial impropriety in public higher learning institutions. The Maasai Mara University corruption scandal showed how top officials including its vice-chancellor pocketed money unlawfully. For a long time, universities have not been subjected to auditing. Lack of accountability of top officials has also provided an environment for corruption to take root. The national government had once ordered a special investigation into financial mismanagement at several public universities, led by then Education CS Fred Matiang’i. Lifestyle audits should be conducted especially of top university management staff who have amassed wealth shortly after getting into office and those properties confiscated. Mombasa
