The government must foster public-private partnerships in order to enhance the sustainability of the country’s development agenda, experts have said. The experts said that the public and private sectors play a pivotal role in advancing Kenya’s development agenda but can achieve more if they work together. They spoke during a two-day sustainable innovations conference organised by Zetech University in Ruiru on Friday. Kasneb representative Kariuki Ng’ang’a said that the state must formulate a coherent legal framework that supports innovations by the private sector. “The government should also promote research and the generation of knowledge in all levels and institutions of learning,” he said. Ng’ang’a said that the government should strengthen the necessary supportive physical infrastructure especially ICT and other strategic facilities. He also noted that the state should facilitate the establishment of linkages, within and amongst universities to promote research and innovations. “Also, the government has a mandate of establishing a robust institutional framework to source, mobilise and manage resources directed at the innovation agenda,” he said. Zetech University vice chancellor Njenga Munene called on higher learning institutions across the country to work together to enhance the sustainability of the country's development agenda. Munene said that Zetech is ready and open to partnerships that will promote the students’ skills and knowledge so as to make them solution providers. He also noted that the university is more focused on research and supporting innovations that will assist the country to tackle some of the problems it faces. (edited by O. Owino)
