United States International University Africa (USIU)-A men team will be without the injured midfielder Felix Kiptoch in today’s KHU Premier League match against Wazalendo at City Park. The midfielder has a hairline fracture and will be out for the next two weeks. Despite that, coach John Kabuu is still optimistic that they will pick maximum points in today’s match. He asked the team to improve on their defence considering they have conceded 14 goals and scored 13 in nine matches. USIU beat Wazalendo 1-0  in the first leg match courtesy of Lawrence Makhatsa’s 55th-minute strike and will be seeking repeat performance. USIU ‘A’ are currently placed seventh with 10 points. “We have conceded some easy goals and we have worked on our defensive lapses. We also need to score more if we have to get away with points. We can beat them for a second time this season,” he said He said: “We have trained for a month so I expect a good response from the whole team. We can hurt them with our pace and quick ball movement.” Wazalendo on their part will be out to get their third consecutive victory after wins against Police and Sikh Union propelled them to the second spot with 20 points. Coach Fidelis Kimanzi is worried about his opponent’s pace but remains upbeat their recent good run will continue. “We respect them because they are a good team with a great coach. They have good young players and we will have to stop them. My players are motivated ahead of this game.” A win for Wazalendo will undoubtedly enable them to dethrone leaders Butali from the top spot. The defending champions will return to action on Sunday against Police.
