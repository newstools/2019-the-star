Embrace team chairperson Rachael Shebesh has lamented that the majority of Jubilee women leglistors have refused to join the movement. "Wale wamama wako kwa Embrace movement ni wadogo sana ni wa mama wa Uhuru Kenyatta, Jubilee tuko kidogo sana but ODM ni wengi (The women in Embrace are President Uhuru Kenyatta's supporters, but there are very few frowm Jubile. The movement is dominated by women from ODM." she said. "Sasa zingine tunakaanga tunaona tuko peke yetu ... Kuna problem hapo." This translates to, "Sometimes we feel alone... There is a problem." The Embrace group has come under criticism from rival group Inua Mama Jenga Taifa under Kandara MP Alice Wahome, a supporter of Deputy President William Ruto. Team Embrace brings together elected women leaders who supportÂ  the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition chief Raila Odinga. Embrace is seen to support the handshake, while Inua Mama Jenga Taifa is seen to lean towards Deputy President William Ruto.
