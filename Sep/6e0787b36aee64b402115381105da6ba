All Africa Advisors is a London-based, multi-disciplinary advisory firm, specialising in commercial and developmental projects in Africa. The firm has conducted projects in nearly every country across the continent, covering diverse requirements. It was established to provide insights and analysis on African matters. The recent research, which reviewed the impact of devolution in Kenya, was carried out between June and August 2019. AAA indicated that it was prompted to carry out the survey since six years after devolution, no in-depth examination had been undertaken to ascertain if devolution delivered its promise to transform lives of the people and generally improve the quality of life and the impeding factors that need to be resolved. AAA devised a three-pronged strategy in the survey. The research had a self-assessment survey for each county, an opinion poll in all counties and a county development verification exercise. The three approaches were deemed to provide a more robust evaluation as opposed to “populist” surveys. Counties were required to provide evidence to support their scores on the questionnaire. The poll and verification exercises were done in all counties and in several towns and villages, especially during market days. The random samples ensured a gender balance. Ten people were interviewed per town or village, thus producing a sample of 1, 410 respondents. Thirty-five per cent of the respondents were aged between 30-50 years, 38 per cent were aged between 18-30 years while 27 per cent were over 50 years old. AAA directors Steven Kanyatte and James Michael said data collected was used to scientifically and accurately rank the governors. The study also documented that each devolved unit is facing. The firm plans to conduct another survey in 2023 to take stock of improvements realised over four years . It called for more engagements with county governments aimed at assisting them to improve service delivery and performance.
