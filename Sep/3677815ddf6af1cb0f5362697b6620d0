Despite being inexperienced at the World Athletics Championships stage, fast-rising 5,000m sensation Jacob Krop has vowed to end the 14-year wait for a gold medal over the distance in today’s final at the Khalifa International Stadium Doha Qatar. Kenya last savoured victory in the race in 2005 through Benjamin Limo in Helsinki, Finland but Krop, who sailed to the finals alongside compatriot Nicholas Kimeli is keen to upset the form-book and quench the undying thirst for the gold medal. Fortunes swung in favour of the Form 3 student as he miraculously finished fourth during the trials but made the cut to represent the country as a replacement for Michael Kibet and Daniel Simiyu, who had not attained the required three out of competition tests threshold. The 18-year-old student at Chewoyet Secondary School finished second in the heats and feels he has what it takes to withstand the competition in the final and deliver the elusive gold medal. “It’s my first time to be at this stage and I know I am not one of the favourites. That said, I am here to prove a point and announce my arrival on the global stage. “The last time the country won the race I was a kid but I hope I will make the difference today. We have a good plan with Kimeli and hopefully, we will deliver.” Born in Kapenguria, West Pokot, Krop was enrolled at the Foot Steps Academy for his primary school studies where he says he discovered his talent. With the controversy surrounding his late admission to the Kenyan team, the diminutive athlete revealed that he will justify his inclusion on the track. “A lot was said after I made it to the team but that will not stop me from achieving my objective. I am not under pressure to show that I am equal to the task neither am I afraid of our opponents. In future I want to establish myself as a force to reckon with and break the existing record in the race before upgrading to 10,o00m,” he said.
