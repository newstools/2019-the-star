About 50 farmers from 13 subcounties in Kiambu benefited from a trip to Yatta, Machakos county, organised by the County Development Implementation Coordination Committee (CDICC). Kiambu county commissioner Wilson Wanyanga who chairs the CDICC led the delegation which comprised senior county officials. On Friday the farmers thanked the government for the trip to learn  about irrigation. They said they learnt new farming techniques to boost food security for the growing population. They were hosted by Bishop Titus Masika of Yatta ACK Diocese who shared with them his success in irrigation. Kenyatta location in Yatta has 4000 water pans which now enable residents to grow food for consumption and export. Beth Kamau, a farmer from Kijabe in Limuru subcounty, said for the country to be self-reliant in food security, it was important for farmers to be patient, acquire new skills and seek professional advice. Duncan Kariuki from Githunguri said Bishop Masika had transformed his entire location, enabling residents to produce their food in an extremely dry area.
