The government has commenced vetting and registration of persons on the Lamu-Somalia border to issue them with identification cards. A similar exercise was halted six years ago following fears that al Shabaab militants would would get IDs. Many residents of Kiunga, Ishakani, Ras Kamboni, Mkokoni, Kiwayu and all villages within the Boni forest have no IDs. Others affected areas are Faza, Kizingitini and Ndau. The situation has locked many youth out of employment. On many occasions, residents without IDs are arrested on suspicion of being terrorists. County registrar of persons Wilson Onyango said on Sunday the vetting and registration was already underway. He said residents must provide all the necessary personal information to acquire the deocument. Onyango said the exercise will go on until every adult person gets an ID. “The turnout has been awesome. People are coming in large numbers. We, however, insist that they bring along all the necessary documents otherwise it will be tough. We will do this until all adults acquire the cards,” Onyango said. Residents are excited about getting the cards. Mohamed Shee said the exercise couldn’t have come a better time. “So many of our youth here who are 18 years and above don’t have IDs.They have been tormented by security officers day in and out. They can’t go anywhere without being arrested. Convincing them that you are Kenyan without IDs has been impossible,” he said. Fishermen said their major economic activity has been hampered due to lack of IDs. “Here we are under rules as fishermen. If you have to work at night, you have to carry your ID with you and show the Navy. Those of us without it have been tormented enough. But we are glad that this will soon end,” said Takwa Salim from Kiunga.
