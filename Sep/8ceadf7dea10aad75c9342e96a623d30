The Will of Dutch Tycoon Tob Cohen will be read tomorrow. A letter from the law firm Kirundi & Company states that the Will will be read on Friday at their offices at 11:30 am. The announcement comes a day after Cohen's body was identified at Chiromo Mortuary following a postmortem. Cohen will be buried on Monday in a private ceremony at a Jewish cemetery in Nairobi. Director of Public Prosecution and Director of Criminal Investigations have been asked to facilitate the compromised arrangement.
