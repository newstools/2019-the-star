Nakuru county will build a solar energy plant to reduce escalating electricity bills. Deputy Governor Eric Korir said the county has been paying millions of shillings to the power supplier monthly. “Once the solar power system is installed, the county will use saved funds to pay the power bills to other development goals,” he said. He spoke during the opening the annual Solar and Renewable Energy Exhibition at Kabarak University. “Green energy is one way of ensuring environmental conservation," Korir said. Research Innovation and Outreach Director Moses Thiga said the exhibition aimed to demonstrate to the community the importance of renewable energy. “We have added a new dimension of other renewable energies like biogas, which can be used in homesteads," Thiga said. Petmary Solar Center's Kennedy Kipkurui called on the community adopt clean energy, saying it can cover most remote areas not connected to the national power grid. “The community needs to shift their focus to green energy," he said. Kabarak University is planning to build a 10MW power plant at the proposed Sh45 billion Kabarak University Teaching, Research and Referral Mission hospital.
