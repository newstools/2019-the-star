Nyeri residents have opposes the Bill by Uasin Gishu Woman Representative Gladys Shollei to increase the number of women MPs. County speaker John Kaguchia said increasing representatives in the national and county assemblies will be a big burden to Kenyans. “Noting that already Kenyans feel overrepresented, this proposal will increase the burden. The government has made various efforts to empower women in Kenya, some of which are still ongoing,” he said. Political parties, he said, ought to sensitize and empower women more so that they can compete the men for the available seats. Francis Ndegwa, a Nyeri town resident, said the number of MPs should instead be reduced to 180 and not increased saying nomination seats, Woman Representative seats and the Senate should be abolished. Uledi Majid said Kenyans want ways of reducing the burden of representation, not adding to it. He also proposed that women be encouraged to compete with men for the available seats. The amendment presented by Shollei is meant to address the two-third  gender rule stalemate in the National Assembly, Senate and county assemblies. She has proposed that for counties with even number of constituencies, every two constituencies elect one Woman Rep. Three constituencies from the rest and those with low population should produce one representative. Residents also opposed the amendment to have someone nominated to represent those in the diaspora, saying they should be represented by their local MPs and send their grievances through the embassy.
