Some 250 households in Butula subcounty are to be supplied with water from a Sh6 million borehole. Butunyi Primary, St Monica Butunyi Girls Secondary and St Monica Catholic Church will also benefit. The borehole is a project of the Lake Victoria Water Works Development Agency. County chief officer for Water, Irrigation, Environment and Natural ResourcesÂ  Moses Weunda said three more boreholes will be dug in Khwirare, Benga and Oshalai. Pipes, a storage tank, a solar pump and a water kiosk have been installed. Another borehole is supplying water to Kapina Dispensary in Bukhayo North/Walatsi. Weunda encouraged residents to pay their water bills. He also told the board of management to install metres for all customers and open an M-Pesa pay bill number for ease of payment and accountability.
