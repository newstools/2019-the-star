The Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry has signed an advisory agreement with the World Bank Group's program to enhance the Public-Private Dialogue frameworks at the county level. The program, Kenya Competitiveness Enhancement Program (KCEP) is expected to pave way for the implementation of business-friendly reforms and unlock additional investment for Kenya’s private sector. KCEP is a four-year program financed by UK Aid and is being implemented by the World Bank Group’s Finance, Competitiveness and Innovation Global Practice. As part of the agreement, KCEP will support the chamber to review and enhance the institutional and advocacy framework required to facilitate Public-Private-Dialogue in Kajiado, Kilifi, Kisumu, Mombasa, Nairobi, Narok, Nakuru, Turkana and Uasin Gishu counties. The agreement also includes support towards the development of a database of new laws, regulations, licenses, taxes and fees that have implications on the county business environment to enable tracking and analysis of the business environment. KNCCI president Richard Ngatia has said the program will help promote better diagnosis of the investment climate problems. “A project of this stature is commendable as it shall design of policy reforms, build an atmosphere of mutual trust and understanding between the public and private sector and improve social cohesion,” Ngatia said. “At the national level, Kenya has received regional recognition as a benchmark amongst her peers when it comes to matters PPD and it is a high time we cascaded the learnings to the county level,” the Program Manager Sarah Ochieng said.
