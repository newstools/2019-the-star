The government has embarked of a programme to rescue homeless children,  chairperson of the Street Families Rehabilitation Trust Fund, Lina Chebii Kilimo, has said. Kilimo said the street families menace can be effectively addressed through the rescue, rehabilitate, reintegrate and re-socialise (4Rs) programme. The former Marakwet East MP spoke yesterday during the 6th Thika Institute of Business Studies graduation ceremony held at Blue Post Hotel in Thika. She called on chiefs to ensure that all street families in their jurisdiction are enrolled in the programme. Kilimo said the increasing number of street families is as a result of decayed society fabric. "We should all take steps to rescue street families," she said. Kilimo said it was unfortunate that Kenyans watched as street families lacked  food, clothing and shelter. "We should take charge of rescuing street families and stop waiting for 'others' to play the role. Let's be our brother and sister's keeper,"she said. Kilimo urged the youth to help the government in its agenda to bring up responsible families. "Poverty should not be an excuse to having street families," she said. Kilimo also said people leaving with disabilities should not be ignored and hailed the government for setting up a fund for them. Kiambu county education board chairperson Ruth Wanjau commended TIBS for producing all rounded graduates with knowledge and competence that helped in national prosperity. She said certificates and diplomas were papers which the graduates should utilize Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina said that the role played by learning private institutions cannot be taken for granted noting that the government uses over 30percent of the GDP to fund education.
