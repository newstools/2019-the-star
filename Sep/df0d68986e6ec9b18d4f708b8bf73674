Sauti Sol song 'Extravaganza' is Tanzanian President John Magufuli's favourite. It is a song in Kiswahili with a touch of Rhumba. The head of state praised the boy band for the beautiful song, drawing his inspiration from the song. "Hawa vijana hawazuiliwi kufanya kitu, ule wimbo wao wa 'Extravaganza'," he said, addressing Tanzanians during the launch of a new radar system. He mentioned lyrics from the song "'...Na wakifunika wanafunua, sasa sisi ni hivyo hivyo.' They always do anything they want to and no one stops them from doing anything," he said. Speaking to Word Is, Sauti Sol's Bien says it is a big appreciation to Magufuli for recognising young people. "We feel so good that the message of the song can get to Tanzanian audience. Sauti Sol is now presidential," he said. He says it is not a small thing to use a song to explain morals, and that has encouraged Sauti Sol's new signees. If they were to meet him, Bien says they would encourage him to keep doing the good work he is doing for Tanzanians. "That is an opportunity opened for us to do more. Magufuli is a good president and he is doing so many developments with the taxpayers' money without seeking help from other countries like what our own country is doing," he said. Sauti Sol is working on a new album.
