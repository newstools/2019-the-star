Fred Matiangi's passion for his job as Interior Cabinet Secretary is not in doubt. He was in Kiambu onÂ Friday, together with a retinue of police advisers because the infamous and dreaded Mungiki criminal gang seems to be on a revival. He took the rare decision to apologise to Gatundu residents for security failures. The tour was triggered by the brutal hacking to death of shopkeeper Joseph Kibe by a gang of ruthless criminals. Matinag'i promised to transfer police officers and employ chiefs. Run-away crime is not limited to Gatundu. It is a monumental national challenge that must be approached with a robust and coordinated police effort. Last month, Matiang'i was in Mombasa where he promised his team would deal ruthlessly with criminals. His visit was prompted by a gang attack in which scores were injured in Nyali. But as if to mock him, the Mombasa gang again struck. It is apparent police must up their game. They must work with communities to curb crime. Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai and his team must develop a national crime prevention strategy that can deliver results. He might be well advised to revamp community policing because the criminals do not live in isolation - they are part and parcel of our communities.
