Many minors have been defiled either by their parents or members of their community resulting in abortion and school dropouts. Cases of teenage girls getting pregnant, giving birth then throwing the infants in latrine are raising an alarm. Some of them throw away the babies to be able to go back to school or out of fear their parents will punish or neglect them. Only very harsh laws will protect these teens from predators by locking them up for a very long time. Anyone charged with defilement should also be denied bail to protect other minors.  Mombasa
