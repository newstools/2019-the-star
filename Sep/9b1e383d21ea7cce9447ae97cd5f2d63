Victor Wanyama’s proposed move to Brugge is in danger of collapse. Despite Tottenham believing they had an agreement in place to sell the Kenya international for £13m last week, financial issues remain unresolved. The 28-year old, who has two years left on the contract, is having to take a pay cut to join Brugge who were offering a four-year contract. While he is keen to revive his career after being on the periphery of Mauricio Pochettino’s plans, Wanyama is hesitant of rushing into the wrong move just because the transfer window is closing on Monday. Other clubs such as Celtic, Monaco, Valencia and Bologna have shown interest but ideally wanted an initial loan deal and Tottenham want a permanent sale. Meanwhile, Sporting Lisbon midfielder Bruno Fernandes has confirmed he had agreed to a move to Tottenham but his club could not agree a fee. Talking to GQ Portugal, the 24-year old said: “Tottenham made a lot of proposals to me. Everything was right with me or practically. But Sporting said the value was not enough and I have to respect that.”
