Migori county police have increased security patrols at Got Kweru Hills, which is considered holy ground by Legio Maria sect, ahead of their annual pilgrimage. Last Sunday, scores of worshippers at the site in Suna West subcounty were injured and the windshields of two vehicles– a Toyota Probox and a Toyota Corolla–smashed in a night attack. Members are worshipping at a site called Jerusalem in Amoyo village, Nyatike subcounty, and will on September 12 walk over 40 kilometres to Got Kweru. Migori police commander Joseph Nthenge said they are on alert despite not going at the holy ground. “We are on alert and will respond when needed by the church, but we hope they will solve the matter,“ Nthenge said. Legio Maria Pope Raphael Adika said he was aware of the existence of a few disgruntled members but assured that the coming event will sail smoothly. “We are going to war at Got Kweru, we are in for peace,” Adika said. The pope, however, urged faithful to remain peaceful during and after the pilgrimage. On August 8, Migori High Court reinstated Adika as the pope and his rival Romanus Ong’ombe as a patron ending protracted court battles. Justice Antony Mrima ruled that Adika remained the only pope of  Legio Maria Church according to the constitution of the sect. Mrima further ruled that all church members were at liberty to access every worship centre of the church without hindrance from either faction. Edited by R.Wamochie
