Popular Kikuyu artiste Kamande wa Kioi has asked Kenyans to pray about the worrying spate of accidents happening in Kenya. This is after he was involved in a road accident on Thursday night on his way home. His car collided with a Nazigi Sacco bus on Kamiti road. Speaking to The Star, Kamande has confirmed he is finally discharged from hospital. “I am out of the hospital and the scans have confirmed I am doing well after that accident and I thank God,” he said. He escaped with minor injuries and was rushed to the Nairobi Women’s Hospital. This comes barely a month after popular Kikuyu artiste John DeMathew lost his life in an accident. DeMathew died on August 18 after his vehicle rammed a truck at Blue Post, Thika. On Sunday another Kikuyu pop musician Samidoh escaped unhurt after he was involved in an accident after performing at Mugithi Festival on Saturday at Barclay’s Sports Club, Thika Road. Taking to social media, the popular musician posted a photo of his car with a dent. “It’s hard to understand how somethings happen. Thank you, God, you saved my kids and me,” he captioned it. Kamande has urged matatu drivers to be vigilant and careful on the roads and above all, they ensure they signal even when they are dropping off passengers. He urged the nation, especially Benga lovers across the country, to put their artists in prayer. “There is an accident spirit roaming around and people should pray a lot. To my fans I am well and thank you for your prayers,” he said. Other musicians also sent in messages wishing him a quick recovery. Ngaruiya Junior, took to his Facebook page to assure Kioi’s fans that he was fairing on well. “Kamande Wa Kioi was involved in an accident and I want to thank God because he is fine. We are at the Nairobi Women’s Hospital and he is receiving treatment,” his post read.
