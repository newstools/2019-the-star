Kenyan artiste Esther Akoth popularly known as Akothee has responded after she caused a stir at parliament in revealing clothes. The controversial artiste earlier on Wednesday visited nominated MP David Sankok, causing commotion when she was blocked by Parliament security from accessing the members-only restaurant. Akothee was dressed in a revealing green micro mini-skirt suit. After gaining entry into the MPs only area, the artiste rejected attempts by Parliament orderlies to hand her a kikoy to wrap her mini-skirt. The 5.8 ft singer has come out to defend herself citing she has long legs. "The problem is that my legs are longer than the skirt," she said while walking out of parliament alongside nominated MP David Sankok. Sankok said that Akothee was well dressed in official wear citing that he analyzed her from all angles. "How can I apologize for bringing a beautiful Kenyan with long legs to invite MPs to support her fund to help suffering Kenyans in Turkana. She was extremely well dressed, she was in official wear," he said. "When I went to receive her at the gate I analysed her from all angles and she was well dressed. When I came here they said the skirt must be below the knee," SankokÂ  added Akothee accessed parliament after minutes of pleading from the orderlies, she was whisked away by security through the backdoor.
