A family from Busia county has claimed that their child has been detained at Kakamega County Referral Hospital over a Sh1m bill. The child's father Abdul Mwenengo said Sakina Mwenengo 12, was discharged in July but the management has refused to let her go home until the bill is paid. Mwenengo spoke to the Star at the family home in Bukani sub-location in Bunyala West ward of Budalangi constituency on Monday. He said his daughter had been transferred and admitted to Kakamega County Referral Hospital after Port Victoria Subcounty and Busia County Referral hospitals failed to attend to her. Sakina was admitted to Port Victoria Subcounty Hospital on April 7 and was referred of the same day to Busia County Referral hospital where she underwent an operation. She was then transferred to Kakamega County Referral Hospital on April 29 and spent 10 days in intensive care before being moved to the surgical ward number seven. Mwengo told the Star that the bill on July 18 when the child was discharged was Sh770,007. But her continued stay has accrued extra charges. When reached on the phone, the hospital administrator said he couldn't comment on the case due to confidentiality issues. Mwenengo has appealed to the hospital management to waive the bill so that his daughter can be allowed to return home and sit for her Grade 3 examinations. (edited by O. Owino)
