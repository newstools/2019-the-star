The Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Higher School of the Public Prosecution Service ( ESMPU) of Brazil aimed at implementing joint trainings, research and academic activities relating to prosecutions. This is in line with the DPP's relearning strategy which focuses on training and equipping prosecutors with the necessary expertise and skills to effectively prosecute the emerging criminal trends in the country. Haji also signed an MOU with Brazil's Global Institute for Environment to enhance prosecution & investigation of environmental cases. The DPP said this when he met Brazil's Prosecutor General, Raquel Elias. They agreed to build the capacities of investigators & prosecutors. He will use Brazilian's free technical support as a stop gap measure, as it develops its own system once tested, to suit Kenyan context. Once completed, Kenyan's and Brazilian's systems will complement each other as analysis tools to aid prosecution of emerging, complex crimes. Noordin said his office will adopt Brazil's SIMBA System, a software that will enhance complex crimes prosecution. The SIMBA System isnâ€™t a Tax system, but a separate system with no relation with Tax Collection or KRA SIMBA system. The DPP endeavors to learn from best international practices to enhance execution of its mandate and success in entire criminal justice sector. Noordin noted that organized crimes for example corruption and terrorism get complex by the day, hence, calling for advanced approaches to handle them. He added that the said software will enable exchange of financial records between financial institutions and government agencies handling criminal cases.
