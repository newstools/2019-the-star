A podium finish is all the Kenya Hockey Union men's Premier League side Police will be looking for when they return to the Africa Cup of Club Championships scheduled for December 1-10 in Ismailia, Egypt. Police have given the continental tournament a wide berth since 2016 when they finished behind Eastern Company of Egypt but have oiled their guns to clinch the title. They lost t 3-2 to Egyptians the City Park. The law enforcers hope to put behind their lacklustre performance in the local league where they are currently ranked fourth. Ahead of the tournament, coach Patrick Mugambi has fired a warning to their opponents to brace for a tough battle. Police finished third in the 2011 edition held in Zambia. "We have set our eyes on the ultimate prize as we hope to lay our hands on the coveted trophy that escaped us on home soil. The boys have promised to put their best foot forward. Egyptian teams are always worried about Police and our opponents should be ready for a drubbing," said Mugambi. "When it comes to international matches, players are organised and are motivated to leave a mark. With this commitment, player maturity and team quality should play to our advantage. Players like Willis Okeyo give us different solutions on the field." The injury-hit police return to action on October 6 against Western Jaguars.
