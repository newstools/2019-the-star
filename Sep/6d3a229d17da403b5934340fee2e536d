The Kenyan and Jordan defence forces have partnered on a joint two-week security training aimed at addressing maritime and other security challenges. Kenya Defence Forces chief Major General Samson Mwathethe said the exercise is meant to enhance cooperation between the two countries. The training named Swift Eagle 2019 incorporates Kenya Coast Guard Service and other agencies working to secure Kenya's maritime domain and will enhance their policing capacity. “In regard to the complexity of the contemporary threat environment, we have also included KCGS to diversify perspectives to be practised in the exercise to promote realism in the provision of national security,” Mwathethe said. He spoke during the official launch of the training exercise at Kenya School of Government in Kwale county. He said the inclusion of KCGS will create more space for various agencies to participate in future programmes. “Dangers facing us today are not only broad but also transnational. It is evident, the idea will help us find suitable solutions of cybercrimes, terrorism among others that undermine state safety,” Mwathethe said. He said the exercise will help the teams better comprehend and deal threats through intelligence sharing. The army chief said they chose the Coast region to widen the scope of scenarios to be exercised. He said it was an opportunity to showcase Kenya’s cultural and geographical diversity. “The first forum was conducted in Nairobi then we went to Quwera in Jordan. And we've brought it here this time,” he said. Jordanian contingent commander Colonel Mahmud Ryad said they will benefit a lot from the training since Kenya has got skilled army and expertise.
