Kisumu residents have told the county government to address health workers’ issues to avoid another strike. Health workers on Tuesday gave a seven-day strike notice.  They are demanding full payment of their July and August salaries. The Kenya Medical, Pharmacist and Dentists Union, the Kenya National Union of Nurses, the Kenya Union of Clinical Officers, among other unions, served the notice. Health workers have threatened to down their tools beginning from September 10. But resident Hilda Okendo told the Star yesterday that should this notice elapse, the people who will suffer are the poor residents in the county. The strike notice was delivered to the county public service board chairman and county secretary. However while speaking to the Star, a resident Hilda Okendo said that should this notice elapse, the people who will suffer are the poor county residents. Okendo urged the county government to sit down with the health workers and various stakeholders to find a middle ground and avert this. Businesswoman Elizabeth Onyango said other counties have paid their health workers and wondered why the Kisumu county government was not follow suit. Onyango wants a lasting solution to be found.
