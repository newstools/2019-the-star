Three appointees on Thursday took oath of office to serve on the Bungoma County Public Service Board following a unanimous approval by the County Assembly on Wednesday. The three include Jonathan Namulala from Namwela, Sirisia Sub County, who will serve as chair to the Board, Geoffrey Cherongis from Kaptama in Mt Elgon Sub County and Rose Nasimiyu Soita from Naitiri Kabuyefwe Ward in Tongaren Sub County, who will serve as members. Their nomination follows the retirement of three members of the board in July and one who is due to retire by end of this month. Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati congratulated the chairman and the two members of the board for their appointment and thanked the county assembly for approving the names. “The public service board should know that it has to solve outstanding human resource issues to be done especially the recruitment of chief officers, directors, different technical officers and promotions in different departments that should be completed after the constitution of the public service board," said Wangamati. “The CPSB is almost fully constituted and we are going to embark on recruiting the secretary of the board soon to have a fully constituted board,” he said. The governor said the fully constituted board should be ready to fasttrack the process of appointing sub county administrators, village administrators and village councils that has stalled for two years. Wangamati said that he will be pushing for the recruitment of the secretary of the board adding that he will not condone   corrupt practices by the new county public service board. He said job seekers are the most vulnerable people who should not be subjected to bribery before they get jobs.
