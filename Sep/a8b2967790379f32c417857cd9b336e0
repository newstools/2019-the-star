At least seven children died after a classroom collapsed at a primary school in Dagoretti. The wooden structure at Precious Talent Top School collapsed just minutes after children reported and it left dozens of people injured. The school's director, Moses Ndirangu, has blamed the collapse on the construction of a nearby sewer pipe that he says may have weakened the foundations of the building. This was a disaster waiting to happen especially because the building had an illegal extension, a weak foundation and the materials used to construct it were substandard. The materials were meant for a cowshed, not a classroom. Article 50 (2) (c) is very clear on what standards are needed to license a school. Among them is the condition that the Ministry of Education must close the school premises, or any part of those premises, if they are unsuitable for a school. The death of the seven children could have been avoided if the city council did not approve the plan, if the National Construction Authority did not approve the structure and if the Ministry of Education conducted proper inspections. The three institutions have failed Kenyans and the tragedy raises the question of whether the government cares about less privileged children schooling in informal settlements.
