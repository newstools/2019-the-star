The Busia government has averted water crisis in Port Victoria and environs that had caused a shortage at the subcounty hospital. Chief officer for Water  Moses Weunda and engineers repaired the pumping equipment at the Port Victoria Water Scheme. The repairs took more than five hours on Saturday night. Water Executive Dr Isaac Alukwe met Kenya Power and Lighting Company officials after it disconnected electricity supplies at the scheme. The disconnection followed the impasse between the National Assembly and Senate over the division of revenue for the counties. They also discussed a faulty water meter. Addressing the press shortly after 10.30pm,  Weunda thanked the technical team for a job well done that after water again flowed from the taps. The chief officer also thanked residents of Bunyala West Ward for their patience and KPLC for agreeing to return power until the standoff over the division of revenue was sorted out. Weunda said both the Port Victoria and Sisenye Water Schemes in Bunyala subcounty that are managed by the county supply more than 2,000 households. He said USAID will spend Sh30m to modernise the Sisenye water scheme. The chief officer also thanked Bunyala North MCA Fredrick Musirimba for allocating Sh16 million from the Ward Development kitty to invest in pipeline distribution from the Sisenye Scheme. Water director Eng. Raphael Waswa said the current meter is serving more than 12,000 people. He said the installation of another pumping machine with a capacity of 50 cubic metres per hour will increase coverage by more than 50 per cent. (Edited by V. Graham)
