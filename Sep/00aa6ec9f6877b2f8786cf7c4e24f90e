The Nyeri government will invite the EACC to carry out a risk evaluation of its systems to seal corruption loopholes. Governor Mutahi Kahiga said such an activity was last done two years ago by the regional EACC office. “A report was done, and we were advised on areas that needed attention and what the county needed to do to prevent corruption,” he said. “We will soon be inviting the regional office to carry out another risk assessment of our system just to find out if things are moving on well.” Kahiga spoke when EACC chairman Eliud Wabukala visited his office in Nyeri town on Wednesday. Wabukala said risk assessments can be done by looking into the system, identifying weaknesses and offering advice on how they can be strengthened to prevent corruption. He said if corruption can be prevented from taking place, then it can be a big advantage for Kenyans. Wabukala was accompanied by EACC officials from both regional and national levels. “We are just excited to note that his focus is on the prevention of corruption other than wasting so much resources on arrests and prosecution of suspects,” Kahiga said. The governor emphasised the need to put more effort in preventing corruption rather than acting when it has already taken place. Kahiga said with the introduction of the CBC, the country ought to focus more on ensuring that as learners grow, they know that corruption can bring the country to its knees. “They should be made to know that if corruption continues, counties will not be able to stand and at the end of it all, we will grind to a halt,” the Nyeri governor said. Wabukala announced that the EACC has started a National Integrity Academy (NIAca) to help fight corruption through education. The academy, he said, is a new concept to strengthen the preventive arm of the commission.
