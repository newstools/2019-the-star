Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko was at the EACC headquarters for eight hours as he was questioned over graft allegations for garbage and waste disposal tenders. The Ethics and Anti corruption Commission wanted the governor to explain corruption related queries raised following the awarding and payment of the multimillion-shilling tenders. "We pay around Sh200 million to a company for waste disposal. However, the environmental departmental committee should take responsibility following the issues raised by EACC since I do not know the small things happening in those offices," Sonko told reporters. In March, it was revealed that in six months, the county had paid Sh524 million to 14 companies contracted to collect garbage in Nairobi. Last year in February, Sonko appointed a 10-member pending bills committee, to look into the Sh60 billion debt the county government owed suppliers and service providers.
