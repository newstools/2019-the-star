KRA has turned its focus to devolved governments after several counties were found to be deducting taxes fromÂ  employees but failing to remit them to the authority. In a recent interview with Commissioner General James Mburu, county governments featured as one of the points of focus. According to sources at City Hall, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has been summoned by KRA to appear and explain Sh4.5 billion the county deducted and failed to remit to KRA. This is the money deducted from the county employees as PAYE and suppliers as Withholding tax. The governor is expected to appear before the commissioner on Thursday. Kenya Revenue Authority is also targeting governors from at least six other counties. In addition, the KRA boss has clearly stated that the country does not need to borrow if every Kenyan pays their share of taxes. KRA is currently auditing all the counties and suppliers who do businesses with counties where they either pay or be taken to court .
