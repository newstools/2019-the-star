The County commander of police was on Friday directed to ensure embattled Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion accesses the union office along Mfangano Street, Nairobi. The commander and the OCS Kamukunji police station have further been ordered to provide the necessary security at the premises. Employment and Labour Relations judge Maureen Onyango issued the order following a directive by Justice Hellen Wasilwa dated September 2 that reinstated Sossion as the union’s boss until a case he filed is determined. The ODM nominated MP, who was deregistered as a Knut official by the Registrar of Societies last month, is challenging the legality of Knut National Executive Council (NEC) meeting at which he was dethroned. Through lawyer Judith Guserwa, Sossion told the court that Knut’s NEC illegally convened a meeting and purported to remove him despite a court order being issued stopping the meeting or his removal.
