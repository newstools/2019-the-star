Residents near Olkaria, Menengai and Baringo are set to benefit from projects in Rift Valley run by the Japanese government. The Japanese government has already picked projects for the new system that will improve geothermal energy and solve local community challenges. The projects will have components addressing environment and energy issues, bioresources, disaster preparedness and mitigation, and infectious disease control. The local communities will be the target of the projects to be implemented through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). JICA will partner the Geothermal Development Company which is currently engaged in Olkaria, Menengai and Baringo Silali projects. The programme named "Comprehensive Solutions for Optimum Development of geothermal systems"  will also target researchers and research institutes based on local needs. JICA officials led by Wakamatsu Eiji, the senior deputy director, Energy and Mining Group visited GDC Managing Director Johnson Ole Nchoe in Nairobi on Wednesday. The JICA team is in Kenya to review the geothermal development projects which are being implemented by GDC. Eiji lauded GDC for its latest breakthrough in drilling at the Baringo Silali Geothermal Project. "We will continue to support Kenya’s geothermal sector so that the country can attain energy security and sustainability," Eiji said. Recently, GDC successfully completed a geothermal well that is discharging steam proving that the area has a great resource. JICA was also involved in the development of the Master Plan for the Baringo-Silali Geothermal Project. Ole Nchoe told the JICA team that the future of geothermal energy is bright because the projects in Rift Valley have shown much promise. He noted that this potential is helping to reduce risk levels in the geothermal sector in a bid to make it attractive to private sector investors.
