 Bungoma principals have opposed a plan by the Education Ministry to employ financial managers in schools. The ministry's proposal if approved will strip principals of powers to control monies sent to schools by the government. Under the proposed arrangement, the Education CS would be granted powers to appoint managers of school finances. But Bungoma principals say the government should instead train bursars and the headteachers on financial management. Kenya Secondary School Heads Association chairman for Bungoma Edward Bikala on Wednesday said hiring financial managers will increase the wage bill. He said the plan is not cost-effective because the government will have to employ more than 8,000 managers for all schools. "You cannot employ more people and increase the wage bill when you have people who can be trained at a lower cost and achieve the same results," Bikala told reporters in Bungoma town. The Namusasi Secondary School principal said bursars should be put on permanent employment by the ministry and be transferred like headteachers for quality services. Bungoma High School principal Godfrey Awour said the government should establish a professional management institute to equip school heads with knowledge on prudent financial management. He said hiring new finance managers will create two centers of power within the schools. Awuor who spoke to the Star on Tuesday said the government should consult principals in policymaking and ensure they have mandatory training in financial management. “The ministry and the public should not condemn all principals as corrupt. Those found to be corrupt should be arrested and prosecuted to tame corruption,” Awuor said. Awour said headteachers will support the government's plan only if it will add value to the education system. “A school is a system and should operate as a unit with a single center of power,” Awour said. edited by peter obuya
