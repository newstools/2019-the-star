Widow of Dutch Tycoon Tob Cohen has filed for an application seeking court to issue a production order and also be escorted to the Jewish Cemetery. Sarah Wairimu seeks to compel the court to allow her attend the funeral of the late Cohen. Sarah is accused of murdering her husband and is due for psychiatric assessment before she pleads to the charge on September 26. Cohen will be buried on Monday in a private ceremony. Lawyers from both sides of the family agreed that Cohen will be buried at a Jewish cemetery in Nairobi at 2pm. Jewish tradition prescribes that a person should be buried as quickly as possible, usually after 36 hours, but this would be impractical given the circumstances. Cohen was reported missing from his Lower Kabete home in Nairobi between July 19 and July 20. The killers of slain Dutchman smashed his skull, dislocated his left leg and broke his hands as he desperately fought them off.
