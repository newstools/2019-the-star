Two former secret service chiefs and a political party head were also sentenced after the two-day trial. President Bouteflika was ousted in April following pro-democracy protests. The defendants were detained in May during a wave of arrests targeting the former president's inner circle The ailing ex-leader is currently in a residence west of Algiers, and is not expected to face trial, BBC Africa's Ahmed Rouaba reports.
