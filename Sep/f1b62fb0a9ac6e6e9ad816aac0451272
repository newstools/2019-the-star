Vinicius Jr revealed he has requested more time on the pitch from Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane as he aims to build on an impressive debut season in Spain. The Brazilian, who joined the club in 2018, was a rare bright spark last season in making 31 appearances and scoring four goals as Real Madrid finished third in La Liga. The arrival of Eden Hazard from Chelsea has seen the winger move from the left to the right wing, having started in the opening day win at Celta Vigo before coming off the bench against Villarreal and Rayo Vallecano. Vinicius Jr told AS: “The right-footed players like to play on the left, like Hazard. I am adapting to my new position but on the right I have a lot more difficulties.” “I am training hard and asking the coach that he puts me on the pitch. To have the possibilities to play on both flanks helps me both in Madrid and for Brazil.” The 19-year-old is ‘happy for the way things are going at Madrid and can rely on the help of compatriots Casemiro and Marcelo to bed into life in the capital.’ The winger has received a call-up to the Brazil squad and could make his debut this week. He has now targeted a place at the World Cup in Qatar in 2022: “Without doubt I want to participate. In a year at Madrid I have grown a lot and now I have the opportunity to grow with the best players in the Brazil squad.”
