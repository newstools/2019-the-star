The Public Accounts Committee wants the recruitment of a new Auditor General expedited to ease the National Assembly's work. Chairman Opiyo Wandayi said the Auditor General’s office is critical and should not remain vacant for long following the exit of Edward Ouko. He said his oversight committee will soon be affected by the absence of the substantive auditor more so when the committee considers audited reports of various state agencies. He cited the Public Audit Act, 2015 which he said if not addressed might give room for mischief. Majority leader Aden Duale undertook to raise the issue with the head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua and expressed confidence matter will be concluded within two months. He said the vacancy should have been advertised six months before Ouko’s term ended. “We must have a substantive holder of that office otherwise the Public Accounts Committee will have nothing to do,” Duale said. Ouko’s term ended on August 27 and President Uhuru Kenyatta declared a vacancy in the office in a gazette notice. According to the law, the notice should invite applications which should be forwarded to the Public Service Commission within 14 days. The names are thereafter published in a gazette notice and a selection panel formed by the President to settle on three qualified applicants – having submitted their interview scores to Parliament. The President will select one person and forward his/her name to the assembly for approval within three days of receipt. Ouko had been at the helm of the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) for eight years. Holders of the office serve one term of eight years. (edited by O. Owino)
