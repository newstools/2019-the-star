 The 63km Embu ring road being upgraded to bitumen standards at a cost of Sh3.1 billion is 80 per cent complete, authorities have said. The project stretches from Embu Level 5 and Teaching Referral Hospital in Embu North through Kianjokoma in Embu West to Siakago in Mbeere North. It began in December 2016 and is expected to be completed in three months time. Speaking during a site visit on Wednesday, Kenya Rural Roads Authority manager for Eastern Peter Wachai said the government has already paid Sh2.1 billion for the project. “A bigger section, including the 40km stretch from Runyenjes to Siakago is complete,” Wachai said. He said work was going on in the remaining section of the road. He said works had been slowed down by a delay in the release of funds. "We are optimistic that once the money is released, the work will progress well so that we beat the deadline," he said. Embu county commissioner Abdullahi Galgalo said the project was a key national government flagship programme in the county. “We have done all our best to ensure the road is completed within deadline since it one of our success story in Embu,” he said. edited by peter obuya
