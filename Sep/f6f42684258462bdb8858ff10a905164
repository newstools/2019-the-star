Former Football Kenya Federation (FKF) President Sam Nyamweya has raised the red flag over alleged plans by the current leadership to disenfranchise some areas from taking part in the national polls slated for later in the year. Nyamweya revealed that he had noticed with serious dismay a plan by FKF to lockout sub-branches from participating in the forthcoming elections. “According to the national office, the sub-branches will hold their elections after the branch and national officials have been elected. I find this to be a total infringement of the rights of sub-branches to deny them the opportunity to be part of the exercise,” complained Nyamweya. He said it is only logical and fair that elections are held from Sub-branch level then to the branch and finally the national office. “The structure of FKF is pyramidal with sub-branches at the base, branches at the middle and the national office at the apex. Holding national elections without including the sub-branch officials will be totally untidy and unethical. It is tantamount to climbing a tree from the middle and sounds like the fairy tales of Abunuwasi,” he scoffed.
