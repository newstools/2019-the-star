Three DNA tests results have confirmed that Nairobi MCA Anne Thumbi's son was sired by late Kibra MP Ken Okoth. Lawyer Danstan Omari on Thursday said three samples from three local and international labs were taken and tested. KEMRI confirmed that the chances of Okoth being the father of Thumbi's son were 99.99 per cent. Thumbi had moved to court to have Okoth's family recognise her son as his and involve him in burial arrangements. Last month, the nominated MCA told the Star that she was ready to take a DNA test to prove that her five-year-old son was sired by the late MP. Ann had moved to court through her lawyer Elkana Mogaka suingÂ  Okoth's mum Angeline Okoth and wife Monica Okoth along with Lee funeral home. She wanted her son to be recognised as Okoth's son before the send-off. She attached a photo showing the late legislator's mother Angelina with her grandson, during one of their meetings. Also attached is a photo of Okoth carrying his young son on his shoulders smiling broadly. She also attached a birth certificate of her son that shows that he bears the surname of Okoth.
