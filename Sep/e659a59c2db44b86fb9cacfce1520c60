The Sh633 million Treasury bond forgery case against Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter will proceed to a full hearing after the DCI chief George Kinoti said he has completed investigations. Kinoti on Wednesday told chief magistrate Martha Mutuku they are ready to proceed, but she directed the matter to be mentioned before the trial court on September 12 to schedule the hearing. The prosecution says most of the witnesses expected to testify are from the Treasury and the Central Bank of Kenya. In the case, the lawmaker is charged alongside businessmen Arthur Sakwa and Madat Saburali. They are accused of presenting 42 forged Treasury bills amounting to Sh634 million to the CBK and seeking payment. The three have denied 11 counts of conspiracy to defraud the CBK, forgeries, uttering and making false documents. The charges state that they presented forged Treasury bills valued at Sh286 million on February 16 last year. They are also accused of making a false document, namely a letterhead allegedly from the CBK, for Treasury bills amounting to Sh 347 million purporting to have been issued and signed by Maina Warui, the registrar at the CBK's National Debt office. They also faced another charge that on February 16, 2018, at the CBK, Nairobi,  jointly, knowingly and fraudulently uttered to Kennedy Kaunda Abuga, the director of legal services at the CBK, 18 Treasury bills issue no. 1138, 24 Treasury bills issue no.  1148, two cheque deposit slips, and two letters purportedly signed by Warui which they purported to be genuine. The prosecution also alleges the three made similar bills on unknown dates and place of Sh347 million and Sh272,601,095  allegedly drawn at the Barclays Bank of Kenya and purporting it to be genuine, valid and issued by the CBK. It is said they were arrested minutes after they held a meeting with CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge. They were accused of presenting forged 90-day Treasury bills dated 1990. (Edited by F'Orieny)
