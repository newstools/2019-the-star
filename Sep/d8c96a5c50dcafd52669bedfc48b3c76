Police in Mombasa have stepped up the campaign against organised crime. Four suspects were arrested on Monday in Likoni for attacking residents in a revenge mission after one of their own was gunned down by police on Sunday. Several people were injured in Migombani, Bomani, Nuru, Bahari and Bofu after the burial of Abdalla Swaleh alias Vumbi. Schools and businesses were forced to close early. The six-man gang, armed with pangas, was responding to distress calls after Vumbi was gunned down. “They are trying to regroup. But we are out to eliminate them. Our people have suffered enough,” Likoni subcounty police commander Benjamin Rotich said. Earlier in the day, police in Kisauni arrested Vumbi’s accomplice Harun Swaleh alias Swaleh Mgondi in Mgongeni. Mgondi was involved in stabbing and robbery with violence cases in Nyali and Kisauni. He was facing murder charges in Nairobi. He was arrested at dawn while on a robbery mission. He had dodged the police for four years. The killing came three days after Likoni police arrested more than 40 youths in a crackdown. Rotich said most of the youths are trying to expand their power base in Kisauni to Likoni. On Monday, the officers arrested Margaret Kechula alias Mummy, described as a notorious criminal with expertise in house break-ins. Kechula was arrested by community policing officers in Kisimani and handed over to Nyali police station. She was caught stealing a flat-screen TV and a laptop from a neighbour’s house. The prison department is clearing a forest in VoK dumpsite where teenage gangs hide.  They injured seven people in last week. Kanzu-clad gangs armed with pangas and assorted weapons attacked residents in Kisauni and Nyali. Residents have welcomed the recent developments, saying the efforts are breathing fresh optimism for peace in crime-infested Kisauni and Nyali. Edited by R.Wamochie
