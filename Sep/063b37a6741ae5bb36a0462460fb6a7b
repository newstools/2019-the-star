Lameck Onyango has always been a valuable asset for Swamibapa when it comes to bowling and that was evident in his side’s 18-run (D/L method) win over Ngara Sports Club on Sunday at Nairobi Jefferys. The home team needed a big win to reclaim the top spot in the Nairobi Invitational League and they got just that as Ngara were crushed, thanks to 45-year-old Onyango’s five-wicket haul. Chasing a revised target of 270 to win, Ngara got off to a flying start before they ran into the cunning Onyango. He had a day to remember in the newly established tournament when he registered his seasonal best figures of 5-31 in 6.2 overs to decimate Ngara’s run chase. Onyango was aggressive with his variations alongside the spinners, demolishing the hosts at will. The former national team bowler, who is also the current long-serving member of the club was pleased with his performance. “They (Ngara) are attacking players and we know that. When someone attacks you, there is always an opportunity and that’s what I looked for,” Onyango said. “This young boys (Ngara players) can chase anything. It is a big challenge as an opening bowler and at my age to play modern-day cricket, where the players are swinging the bat and the ball is moving fast,” he said. Onyango, who bagged the first wicket with the board on 16 in the fifth over before taking the second and the third in the 38th over added that he was pleased with how he performed. “I feel really proud. I will take that any day,” Onyango said. “I’m just really pleased. When things like this happen, you feel good about yourself and all the hard work you’ve done in the nets,” he added. Onyango further praised Naman Patel, who top-scored with 150. “He is a very good talent. I’m very happy to see him batting like that. He has what it takes to be among the top players in the country,” he added.
