Ruiru MP Simon King’ara has urged residents to organise themselves in groups so as to benefit from government funds. Uwezo, Youth Enterprise and Women Enterprise funds award loans and grants to registered groups for business activities, but not to individuals. King'ara spoke on Tuesday when he disbursed Sh5 million Women Enterprise Funds to over 20 women, youth and people with disabilities groups in Ruiru town. The lawmaker challenged his constituents to apply for and use the state funds as seed capital for their investments. He said that his office will support persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups in the registration process for their groups. The MP said the funds, if well used, will address the problem of joblessness in the region and in the country and help kick out poverty. “This is the only way the government will be able to empower the common mwananchi at the grassroots levels by providing easily accessible money,” he said. King'ara noted that for the past two years his office has disbursed Sh45 million to some 190 groups in the constituency. The MP's Ng’ang’a King’ara Foundation also disbursed Sh1.5 million. “Our people are the ones in the small and medium enterprise and they are known to be the drivers of our country’s economy. We must, therefore, empower them through all means,” King'ara said. The MP urged the beneficiaries to utilise the cash appropriately for their benefit and to embark on income-generating activities. “We wish that the rate of repaying the money will be high and fast so that other groups can taste the state fruits,” King’ara said.
