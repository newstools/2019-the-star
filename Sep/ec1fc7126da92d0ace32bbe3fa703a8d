Meru MCAs have demanded thorough investigations into the use of Sh9 million unaccounted for by the County Investment and Development Corporation. Former Auditor General Edward Ouko’s report raised queries on the expenditure in the 2017-18 financial year. The assembly unanimously adopted a report on the issue tabled by Abogeta East MCA Patrick Mwirigi on behalf of Gerald Ithibua, chairman of the Public Accounts and Investment committee. The report says accounting officers should be held liable if the money is not recovered in the next six months. Nominated MCA Betty Kinya urged the corporation to use resources prudently. The report condemned irregular board allowances contrary to the Salaries and Remuneration Commission recommendations. The nine board members, according to the report, pocketed Sh1.2 million instead of 549,000 in accordance with the SRC guidelines. Mwrigi wants the money returned and an explanation on where the revenue from county hall and other county government-owned entities goes. “The corporation spent Sh327, 000 which cannot be ascertained for an induction seminar for five board members who were accompanied by five staff members. The amount comprised per of diem of Sh27,650 and hotel fee (Sh15,000) paid via M-Pesa which had no supporting documentation. Sh35, 000 was paid to two officers who had traveled a day earlier without any justification,” the committee report says. Non-existing Mugambo FM which was closed on December 21, 2017 due to non-viability was allocated Sh4, 551,829. Another 3,702,429 was spent on a partitioning of offices and purchase of equipment.
