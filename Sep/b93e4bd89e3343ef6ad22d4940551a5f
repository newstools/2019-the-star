In the latest episode in the saga of where Zimbabwe's former President Robert Mugabe will be buried, the family has reversed a decision to have him interred at Heroes Acre in the capital, Harare. Instead he will be buried in his home region of Zvimba. The location of his grave became a source of tension between the Mugabe family and the government. They blame the current leadership for Mr Mugabe's overthrow in November 2017. He was toppled after 37 years in power and replaced by current President Emmerson Mnangagwa. At his funeral, family member Walter Chidhakwa said he had died a "sad, sad, sad man". It was thought that the family had compromised over the site of his burial and agreed to Mr Mugabe being laid to rest at Heroes Acre, where those who fought colonial rule are buried, once a mausoleum had been built. But it seems there has been a change of heart. In a statement, Information Minister Nick Mangwana said the government will respect the wishes of the family and support them in providing a "fitting burial" in Zvimba.
