The IEBC commissioners are currently meeting Jubilee candidate McDonald Mariga's lawyers in a bid to straighten issues on his voter registration. Sources told the Star that the officials were meeting with three external lawyers at the Anniversary Towers and are expected to issue a statement to the media. The commissioners are seeking a legal interpretation of an advisory given to them by their internal lawyers over the Mariga issue. On Tuesday, both the IEBC legal and ICT teams advised the commissioners that Mariga, who is being fronted by DP Willliam Ruto, should not be cleared because he had not been duly registered. The two teams explained that Mariga, who had not been registered previously anywhere, dashed to Kariakor on August 26 where he applied for registration, nearly two weeks after National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi had declared the seat vacant. This comes even as Mariga has petitioned IEBC saying that the decision was improper, null and void. "The complainant is indeed a registered voter .. he was registered on August 26th as a voter in Kariokor Social Hall polling station in Starehe Constituency," Mariga said through his lawyers. Mariga wants IEBC's decision to be declared was void and have no legal effect and that he was validly nominated. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission barred Mariga from presenting his nomination papers on Tuesday after the last-minute discovery that his name was missing from the register of voters. The move threatens to completely block Jubilee from presenting a candidate is the mini-poll.
