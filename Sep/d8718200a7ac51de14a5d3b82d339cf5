Singer Avril says she made sure she graduated before she ventured into music. "I stuck with my education to the end, living in a servant quarter with my younger brother, but made sure I got my degree," she said in an interview with Dr Kingori. Although people asked her to concentrate on music, she chose to finish her studies first. "I used that coil [used for cooking in campus] for four years and studied design," she said. She changed her mind about music during her second year at UoN and recorded her debut single 'Mama' after signing a record deal with Ogopa. She is currently one of the most promising female artistes in Kenya.
