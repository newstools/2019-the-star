Everton flop Yannick Bolasie has hit out at boss Marco Silva after the winger was left out of his side’s matchday squad for Sunday afternoon’s visit of Wolves. The 30-year-old Congolese international has struggled to win favour with Silva since the Portuguese manager’s arrival at Goodison Park last summer. Bolasie signed for the Toffees from Crystal Palace on a five-year-deal in 2016 worth a reported £30million. However, the winger picked up a major knee injury in the back end of that year, forcing him to miss 53 games for his new club. Since then, Bolasie has fallen down the pecking order. Last season he was shipped out to Aston Villa on loan in the Championship for the first half of the 2018-19 campaign, and was subsequently moved on temporarily to Belgian side Anderlecht. The Everton man’s future in Merseyside looks far from certain, having failed to make a single appearance for Marco Silva’s side this season. Big money signings Richarlison and Bernard have secured places on the wing while Everton have further strengthened that position with the signing of Alex Iwobi from Arsenal. And now Bolasie has hit out at his employers for his career hitting a standstill. In a tweet posted before this afternoon’s tie with Wolves, the winger tweeted: “Rah man are out here playing with my career like LEGO.”
