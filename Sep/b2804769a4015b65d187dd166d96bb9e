Six MCAs in Kisumu who were facing assault charges have been set free after the complainant withdrawn the case. They are Seth Ochieng (Market Milimani) Jacktone Ogendo (Nyalenda A), Joachim Oketch (Kondele), Joseph Olale (Nyalenda B), Seth Okumu (East Seme) and Gard Olima (South West Nyakach). They were accused of assaulting and causing bodily harm to chief serjeant-at-arms George Amayo on October 23 last year. Amayo withdrew the case before Kisumu chief magistrate Julius Ng'arng'ar. He said they solved the issue in a meeting at the assembly, hence there was no need of continuing with the case. The second charge against Olale of malicious damage of property was also withdrawn by acting assembly clerk Owen Ojuok. He was accused of wilfully and unlawfully damaging one mace rug valued at Sh20,000 - property of the county assembly of Kisumu. Ng'arng'ar ordered that the accused be released. "The application has been accepted and the second count also withdrawn. All the accused are now set at liberty,"Ng'arng'ar ruled. On Tuesday, the MCAs were questioned by DCI officers at Kisumu central police station and released on cash bail of Sh20,000 each. County criminal investigation officer Towet Kipkorir said the ward representatives honoured the summons and were taken through the requisite procedure. Last year, Amayo shot in the air in self defence when he was attacked by the MCAs. There were gunshots at the county assembly after MCAs engaged Amayo in a fight. Amayo had called police officers to help him restore peace at the assembly.Â MCAs shouted at the officers and they retreated to the sentry box at the assembly entrance. Some members of the public, attracted by the commotion, also attempted to attack the sergeant-at-arms. The latter sought refuge at the security officers' room before he was forced to flee as the MCAs threw stones at him.
