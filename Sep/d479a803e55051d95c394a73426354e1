Mombasa principal magistrate Edgar Kagoni will spend another night behind bars depite posting bail, after the court in Nairobi complained that the order for his release was not authenticated. The Mombasa High Court had earlier on Monday ordered for Kagoni's release on a Sh100,000 bond or an alternative cash bail of Sh20,000. However, the court in Nairobi wanted the hard copy of the order. On Monday night, Kagoni's lawyers were waiting for their flight in Mombasa so that the order could be taken to Nairobi. Meanwhile, Kagoni was being held at JKIA police station. Kagoni's lawyer, Danstan Omari, who remained behind in Nairobi, confirmed that the magistrate was at JKIA police station while they waited for the order to arrive from Mombasa. The case will be mentioned on Tuesday if he is not released tonight, chief magistrate Lucas Onyina ruled. Kagoni was arrested over the controversial disappearance of 10kg of heroin valued at Sh30 million at the court in July. According to DCI, the magistrate faces charges of obstruction with intent to defeat justice and aiding and abetting trafficking in narcotic drugs.
