The Kenyan Premier League match pitting defending champions Gor Mahia and Chemelil Sugar earlier planned for today at Kericho Green Stadium was yesterday cancelled following a late change of venue. Chemelil, who were supposed to be the hosts wrote to the league body on Tuesday requesting to have the match moved from Moi stadium Kisumu to Kericho—a move which could not be effected as the statutes state that a change of venue should be done three days prior to the match day. The sugar millers had cited lack of experience on artificial surface hence requested the match to be played in Kericho—avenue where they lost their league opener. According to a KPL source, Gor sought to have the match cancelled after failing to get a timely flight to Kisumu where they had planned to connect to Kericho by road. Gor, who opened the new season with a 5-2 win over Tusker in Kisumu, were looking to scale to the top of the log in the match while Chemelil were eyeing redemption after losing 3-1 to Zoo FC. “The change was not done in time and Gor were inconvenienced too. They could not get a flight in time to Kisumu as the available ones were already booked. Also looking at the logistical and financial challenges,  it was only fair to shelve the match. The new dates for the match will be known going forward.” Meanwhile, last season's runner up Bandari came from two goals down to beat Zoo FC 3-2 at Mbaraki Stadium. The match saw  Bandari duo of Ramadhan Agege and Justin Ndikumana make their debuts after joining from Sporting Lisbon Academy and Sofapaka respectively. Former Wazito attacking midfielder Collins Neto's brace had given Zoo the lead in the first half but Danson Chetambe and Yema Mwama goals restored parity before Agege netted the winner. Bandari now join the quartet of KCB, Ulinzi Stars, Posta Rangers and Kakamega Homeboyz who all have four points against their names.
