Busia will enter an MoU with Kericho for its traders to supply goods to the South Rift region without attracting taxes. Traders from Kericho will sell their milk and other goods to Busia residents tax-free. Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony revealed the deal in Busia when he presided over a funds drive for the completion of St Peter Kaliwa Catholic Church on Sunday. Chepkwony said his Busia counterpart Sospeter Ojaamong was aware of the planned partnership to boost trade within the Lake Region Economic Bloc. County director for livestock David Mukabane said importation of milk from Kericho will bridge the gap of 32 million litre per annum. Busia consumes 60 million litres every year with the excess demand met through imports from Uganda and Nandi. "We have introduced ambitious programmes in the dairy sector that might see the county meet its annual consumption target and export surplus milk. We have also introduced two dairy parks,” Mukabane said. He said the World Bank through the Kenya Devolution Support Programme has allocated Sh22 million for the two parks. Each will have 80 cows to be under county livestock and veterinary officers, while farmers will be tasked with providing pasture and fodder. “The county has set aside eight acres of land at Busia Agricultural Training Centre for planting silage and hay to cushion against drought,” he said. Mukabane said there were plans for more dairy cows to farmers through the Ward Development Fund in 2020-21 financial year.
