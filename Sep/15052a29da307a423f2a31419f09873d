Former Strathmore University outside hitter Philip Karari has hinted at skipping the remainder of the Kenya Volleyball Federation's national beach circuit as he seeks to find a consistent partner. Karari started the 2019 season pairing up with former Cooperative Bank setter Stanley Mutua before the team was disbanded. His next partner was Ezekiel Yebei who abandoned after a circuit after getting busy with his Prisons side. Both Mutua and Yebei have not been committed to beach volleyball due to work and club assignments respectively.  This has forced Karari to miss four of the seven circuits played so far and he feels he has to take a break as he seeks to find his footing. Consequently, Karari has embarked on a mission to scout for a new partner ahead of next season. He says as much as he has come across a few good players, he is yet to find one who is ready to dedicate personal resources to beach volleyball. “It has not been smooth for me this season. My playing partners have not been available to honour all fixtures of the season. I respect their decisions and I have to move forward and explore to find a committed player to pair with,” said Karari. "For now, I will not play in the remainder of the circuits until next year when I find a committed partner," intimated the player. The astute receiver and attacker revealed that Nyeri-based John Kiganya would have made a very good partner but he is far from Nairobi.
