A 1947 Ford pickup owned by Anwar Fatehdin is the latest entry for the 2019 CBA Africa Concours d’Elegance scheduled for September 29 at the Ngong Racecourse with the number of cars heading for the 60 mark. The pickup is powered by a massive V-8 engine and was among the first Ford trucks produced for civilian use after the end of World War II after previous models were manufactured for the military use. Anwar and his mechanic have been restoring the Ford for nearly three years and are optimistic about clinching a high place in the popular utility class during this year’s event. “We are working against the clock to rebuild and have the pickup ready on time,” said Anwar. Meanwhile, the eight motorcycle categories have attracted a wide variety of entries ranging from the 125cc Suzuki TF of newcomer Stephen Mbuthi to the giant 1999 Harley Davidson owned and prepared by Tumaini Muthiga, a regular participant. 13 members of the Uganda Bikers Association (UBA) will also be riding from Kampala to the Racecourse. The UBA contingent includes Moses Lubega with a BMW R1200 GSA made in 2004 and Stephen Mukisa with a 2005 Kawasaki ZZR 1400. In addition, there will be 28 motor trade stands in Auto Expo which enable the motor industry to showcase their new line of vehicles and products to the motorists.  There will also be a sale of classic and vintage cars and motorcycles. Another attraction will be the Heritage Collection stand which offers a display of old equipment and machinery including old steam engines.
