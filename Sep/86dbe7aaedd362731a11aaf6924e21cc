A Malawian accused of being in the country illegally yesterday told the court that he came for treatment. Martha Sekale was charged with being the country illegally but he denied the accusations and in his defence, said only his eyes brought him to Nairobi. Sekale said he has had eye problems for years and was told that he could get treatment in the country. "I only came to have my eyes and chest treated. I'm not looking for chaos," he pleaded. Sekale told Kibera Senior Principal Magistrate Esther Boke that he left Malawi to Nairobi on invitation from his Brother-in-law who stays in Kileleshwa. "I came on the invitation of by my brother-in-law who stays in Kileleshwa, but most importantly I have a passport to prove that I am here legally for my medication," he said. He told the court that the police arrested him alongside his friends. "I told the officer that I had left my passport in the house in Kileleshwa but he told me that I must go to the police station and finish my journey in court, I had no option but to come here," he said. He said that he had tried to call his close allies and inform them of his whereabouts and pleaded with the court to dismiss the case. Boke directed that the matter be set aside for police to confirm Sekale's claims and asked that he is allowed to contact his relatives. The matter willÂ  be mentioned on Monday.
