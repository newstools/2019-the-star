Hungry elephants and buffaloes have been attacking farms, destroying crops and water catchment areas and even killing a resident in Pangani. One man was killed in Godo in Kwale county. Residents presented their grievances to Deputy President William Ruto at Lunga-Lunga subcounty on his Coastal tour. Ruto told residents the problem will be dealt with immediately and a perimeter wall will be built to prevent further havoc. Residents said an old man at Kasemeni was killed by elephants on his way home and two other boys seriously injured on a different occasion at Pangani. Josephine Kiloko said their daily activities have been curtailed as they live in fear of sudden attacks by wild animals. “We depend on farming and if farms are vulnerable to attacks, it means we have to keep off for a while and paralyse everything. Even water points are inaccessible. Imagine what kind of life we are going through,”Kiloko said. She said the situation is so bad that children can no longer routinely go to school. “The elephant menace is now unbearable, children are sometimes forced to stay at home until calms is restored. This forces them to skip classes frequently," Kiloko said. Lunga- Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani blamed KWS for inaction. He said human-wildlife conflict has occurred from the north of Godo where KWS is not able to assist. (Edited by V. Graham)
