The East African Healthcare Federation was launched last Thursday by Health CS Sicily Kariuki at Safari Park Hotel, Nairobi. The conference, which happened for two days, attracted delegates from all over the continent, including EAHF chairman Dr Amit Thakker, IHF Uganda's Dr Ian Clarke and Tanzanian Health ministry representative Dr Miriam Ongara. The EAHF is a forum for healthcare stakeholders, including government leaders, private corporations and health advocates.
