Arsenal fans were left holding their heads in their hands after watching Granit Xhaka produce a moment of madness against Tottenham on Sunday... and it wasn’t the first time. With the Gunners already 1-0 down following Christian Eriksen’s early strike, Xhaka slid in two-footed on Son Heung-min in the box, leaving the referee no option but to point to the spot. Kane struck the penalty hard into the bottom left corner, sending Bernd Leno the wrong way and putting his team two goals up. Viewers and pundits couldn’t believe what they had seen from Xhaka, who had completely ignored the old rule of staying on your feet in the box. However, Arsenal supporters were less surprised, the Swiss having a history of making costly mistakes. In fact, stats provided by Opta show no Premier League outfield player has made more errors leading to goals than Xhaka since the start of the 2016-17 season. Sunday’s blunder was the midfielder’s seventh in that three-year period, two more than any other top flight star. Bournemouth defender Simon Francis is guilty of the second highest number of mistakes in that time with five while the likes of Nicolas Otamendi and Xhaka’s Arsenal team-mate Shkodran Mustafi also feature high on the list. Xhaka made two last term, gifting West Ham a winner with a poor headed clearance at London Stadium and misreading a pass which allowed Wolves to break and find the net at the Emirates. Fortunately for the 26-year-old, goals from Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang saw his side rescue a point on Sunday. He took to Instagram to hold his hands up following the game, writing: “for the penalty I made a mistake — I’m of course angry about it but I will never give up!
