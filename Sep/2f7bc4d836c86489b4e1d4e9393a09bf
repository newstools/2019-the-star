Residents of Nabureriya village in Bumula constituency have asked the county government of Bungoma to build a better bridge in place of the current one that has claimed many lives. Sio Sango bridge connecting Kabula and South Bukusu wards consists of rotting logs and is used by hundred of residents daily. Francis Simiyu, a resident,  said the bridge is a death trap. “Many people have been killed while trying to cross this bridge especially during the rainy seasons. Just two weeks ago, our neigbour from across, Namachanja Mayende, drowned while trying to cross the river ,” he said. Village elder Fred Wabwire told the Star school children were most at risk. “The most affected pupils are those of Nabureriya primary, Kibachenje  secondary  and Namachanja ECD ,” he said. He said many pupils spend hours at the banks of the river shouting for help from well wishers to help them cross. Residents said their appeals to the county government and the local CDF office have fallen on deaf ears. “This bridge has always been used as a campaign tool but when they get into power they forget about it. Our pleas and memorandums to them have always fallen on deaf ears ,”Said Mary Wanjala a resident. Bungoma CEC for Roads and Infrastructure Collins Mukhongo declined to comment on the issue.
