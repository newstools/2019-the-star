A video posted on YouTube by Uasin Gishu Bunge claiming that Uasin Gishu county assembly has passed the Punguza Mizigo bill is TRUE. The video shows members of the Uasin Gishu County Assembly debating the bill, which was introduced by Tarakwa Ward MCA Hon. Patrick Bundotich. Bundotich is the chair of the Delegated Legislation Committee in the county assembly. Uasin Gishu county assembly speaker David Kiplagat confirmed that the county has passed the bill and would forward their resolutions to the speakers of both the National Assembly and Senate. The Uasin Gishu county assembly also shared a post by the ThirdWay Alliance confirming that it had passed the bill. The proposed Punguza Mizigo constitutional amendment bill by the ThirdWay Alliance Party seeks to reduce representation and and boost infrastructure from the grassroots level, starting with the county assembly wards. PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Uasin Gishu has become the first county to pass the Punguza Mizigo bill and finds it to be TRUE.
