A Nairobi Court has acquitted four politicians of incitement to violence charges leveled against them in 2016. They are; Suna East Mp Junet Mohammed, Kilifi women rep Aisha Jumwa, Florence Mutua(Busia) and Timothy Bosire (Westlands). The fourÂ  were part of six politicians who were released on cash bail over alleged hate speech charges after spending four days in the cells. Making the ruling on Thursday, chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku said the charge sheet was defective and not clear. She said their cash bail will be refunded. The government said it had no apologies for making them sleep in the cells.
