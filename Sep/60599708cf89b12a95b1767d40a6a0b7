The family of a veterinarian who died after she was hit by a police vehicle two weeks ago has accused the government of denying them justice. Magdaline Mamai was a veterinary officer in charge of Chakol Division. The accident occurred on August 21 at Amerikwai trading centre in Busia town. Speaking to the Star at his Mairo village home in Teso South subcounty on Tuesday, widower Caroli Omuse said since the death of his wife, they have not received any communication from the police regarding the incident. “I received a phone call from Kotur police station assuring me that the case would be resolved and justice delivered, but I'm still waiting,” he said. The motorbike rider who was ferrying Mamai to her office at Amerikwai trading centre survived and was taken to Busia County Referral Hospital. Omuse said according to witnesses, the driver of the police vehicle was allegedly in hot pursuit of another car. “Where shall we seek justice from if law enforcement officers have refused to assist us?" another family member, Benjamin Emukule, asked. Omuse said that apart from arresting and arraigning the driver of the police car, the family had expected the police to pay hospital and funeral expenses. “We had expected the government to assist us in footing the hospital, postmortem and funeral expenses,” he said. Mamai was laid to rest at her home in Mairo village, Teso South subcounty, on  August 31. Family members are now appealing to the government, through the Interior Ministry, to help them get justice.
