Two people have been found guilty of killing an endangered Green turtle in Lamu. The two -Harun Seif and Madi Athman-were found in possession of a freshly killed Green turtle belonging to the Chelonia Mydas species. They had trapped and killed it at Mwambore area on Kui island of Kiunga division, Lamu East. Making the ruling on Friday, Lamu Resident Magistrate Allan Temba fined them Sh 3 Million fine each or face a five-year jail term. In his ruling, Temba stated that the Green turtle was a rare and endangered species whose population was quickly dwindling around the globe due to illegal activities such as poaching. He said they are also protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. “The Green turtles are rare and endangered and that’s why they are protected... It is beyond doubt that you’re guilty of the charges," he said. The two were arrested by Kenya Wildlife Service on June 2018. Five witnesses testified against the two leading to their sentence. TURTLE BENEFITS Residents of Lamu continue to kill and consume turtle meat, soup and fat in the belief that it carries immense health benefits. Turtle fat is believed to cure ailments like Asthma and Tuberculosis. Locals also believe consumption of turtle fat help cure impotency and boost male sexual stamina. Fishermen in the region claim turtle fat consumption also helps them stay underwater for longer especially when they have to dive in search of shrimp and crabs. Nutritional experts have however disputed the claims terming them as misleading. Currently, there is a ban forbidding the hunting of any kind of turtle efforts gear towards conservation and preservation of their dwindling population. For years, locals have agitated to be allowed to freely hunt and consume turtles on those bases.
