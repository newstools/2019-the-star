KCB inched closer to the national Sevens crown after winning their third title of the campaign during the Christie Sevens over the weekend. The bankers Nakuru 12-7 in sudden death to add another trophy to the two they grabbed in Kisumu and Kakamega. KCB now need 16 points in the final leg set for Mombasa, the Drift Wood Sevens this weekend, to grab a third overall title. In arguably the toughest final to-date, Nakuru got off to a good start when flanker Monate Akuei crashed over the line with Geoffrey Ominde converting to give the Wanyore a 7-0 lead. KCB coach Dennis Mwanja's charges never panicked and grew in confidence and their efforts were rewarded when Geoffrey Okwatch crossed the line with Levi Amunga slotting home the conversion to tie the match at the interval. On resumption, both sides threw everything into attack in a riveting second half which kept fans off their seats. But despite the big hits and scrambling defence, the game ended tied at 7-7 at full time. In extra time, a moment of magic from Johnstone Olindi set up Elphas Adunga to score the match-winner. Mwanja termed the win the toughest so far. "This was a tough one. Nakuru fought until the end but the character of my boys and experience carried the day for us," he said. KCB had beaten rivals Mwamba 17-12 in the semis as Nakuru came from behind to beat Impala 19-14. Impala took the bronze medal position by beating Mwamba 21-12. Homeboyz finished fifth after thrashing Nondies 24-0.
