Don't wait until you are elected governor to take action on corrupt county officers, Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has told Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr. Kibwana was reacting to the senator’s remarks at the weekend in Kaiti subcounty where he said he would not work with corrupt and lazy people if he was elected governor. “If I vie and I'm elected governor, I will not work with corrupt or lazy people,” Mutula had said. But speaking in Wote town on Wednesday, Kibwana said the senator should act now, since his office is constitutionally mandated to participate in oversighting the county government and state officers. “We don’t condone corruption in our government and that is why the Auditor General gave us a clean bill of health. However, I'm asking him [senator] that if he has any information on corrupt employees, he should forward them to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission,” Kibwana said. The county chief said it is not guaranteed that the senator will succeed him. The senator said he is ready to assist in the war on corruption. “Needless to say, to succeed in the war on corruption we must be prepared to sacrifice. I'm ready to stand up for what is right,” Mutula Jnr told the Star.
