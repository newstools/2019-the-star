Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed has lauded Athletics Kenya for exercising transparency in the selection of Team Kenya to the 2019 World Championships as National Trials concluded yesterday. Amina also lauded AK for putting in place strong measures to curtail the doping mess before the team selection. “The process of team selection has been transparent and we expect the whole country to rally behind the team during the Doha event. We thank you for your service to the country and we wish you all the very best as you prepare for the Worlds. We look forward to a successful event in Doha,” said Amina. AK president Jackson Tuwei said the country was ready for Doha and all they will do in Camp from Monday will be to polish up the team “We, as AK and ADAK, are satisfied with the athletes we have selected. We started our team selection with the anti-doping tests and this is just but the tail end of the process,” said Tuwei. "We appreciate the love and goodwill President Uhuru Kenyatta has for these athletes. We also thank the ministry of sports for the support you've given us and we know the remaining bits (allowances) will be settled well in time," added Tuwei. Amina encouraged the athletes to go and defend their titles in Doha. "It has been a golden year for Kenyan sports. The athletes represent a monumental image of Kenya and I want to encourage you all that you can conquer the world again," said Amina who also said that her office is working hard to fulfil their obligation to the team in time.
