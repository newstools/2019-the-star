University of Nairobi women's volleyball beat arch-rivals Strathmore in a five-set thriller as the 2019/2020 Nairobi South KUSA got underway at the University of Nairobi (UoN) Graduation Square over the weekend. In the absence of coach Josp Barasa who is in Japan with the National women's team, Strathmore had little to offer as UoN Vixens took advantage of rivals' vacant touchline to deliver on the day. Captained by Isabella Nabwire, the home team came from a two-sets' deficit to run away with a 3-2 (22-25, 19-25, 25-22, 29-27, 15-12) win in the season opener. The gamechanger was in the third set when setter Vane Kemunto was brought in for Vixens' utility player Mercy Katunge who was moved to the right attacking position. The substitutions also saw opposite hitter Linda Imbandu move from right to replace middle blocker Mercella Kiende. The changes saw UoN rally from 3-15 down to level matters 19-19 and went on to win 25-22. Applauding her teammates, Nabwire said: "That was a great morale booster as we begin the season. We want to finish the league at the top  and therefore we have  to build on this victory going forward." In another women's match, Africa International University beat Multimedia University 3-2 (25-14, 22-25, 12-25, 25-21, 15-5). Buoyed by Kenya international junior beach volleyball pair of setter Matthias Kemboi and outside hitter Wilfred Kimtai, Strathmore men's outfit staged vengeance by condemning UoN Beez to a 3-0 (27-25, 25-20, 25-18) beating. Strathmore also beat a stubborn Multimedia University 3-1 (23-25, 28-26, 28-26, 25-14 while Machakos University saw off AIU in straight sets of 25-19, 25-20, 25-20. In a low scoring men's basketball game, hosts UoN under the team's alumni George Genge beat both Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology- Karen and Umma University 42-22 and 42-20 respectively. Guided by national 3-on-3 basketball coach Tonny Ochieng, Strathmore overwhelmed Machakos University 45-28 and defeated Technical University of Kenya 56-33. Multimedia University also got their season rolling by clubbing Africa International University 47-27. Zetech hammered Machakos 26-70, Strathmore clobbered AIU 46-17 as TUK won  42-58 against JKUAT Karen in a more entertaining and competitive duel. UoN Dynamites braved tough opposition from Zetech to win by a basket (34-32) as Machakos University fell 42-17 to Strathmore. Multimedia's shooting skills came under sharp scrutiny following their 06-40 loss to Strathmore. Even after grabbing several steals, Multimedia's execution at the basket was still wanting.
