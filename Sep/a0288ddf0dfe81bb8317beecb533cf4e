The Kenya premier league side Kakamega Homeboyz captain and former international Allan Wanga has reiterated that he is still has what it takes to his side to the top this season. Speaking at Bukhungu Stadium after he helping his team to pip AFC Leopards 1-0 on Sunday, Wanga revealed that he will be the man to watch this season and that he has no any intentions of hanging his boots any time soon. “I think when the time comes for me to quit, I will do so but it's not yet time for me to hang my boots. For now, I want to give my whole this season and try to make Homeboyz win as many games as possible,” Wanga stated. Last season Wanga narrowly missed the Golden Boot after Ulinzi's Stars' Enosh Ochieng overtook him on the final after scoring a hat-trick against Mt Kenya. Ochieng had 20 goals to Wanga's 18 and it remains to be seen how the rivalry will pan out this season.
