Ugenya MP David Ochieng has asked ODM leaders to ensure the push f0r a referendum is based on issues and not reduced to a contest between Raila Odinga and William Ruto. Ochieng said a referendum must be aimed at making the country better. Speaking in Ugunja on Saturday, the MP said Kenyans should dialogue so that the push for law change takes in all views. He spoke when he addressed residents of Ugunja town. He was with area MP Opiyo Wandayi. Ochieng' who beat an ODM candidate in the Ugenya by-election in April said the party's push for a review of the Constitution was a good thing that should not be tainted by "petty politics." "In 2010, everyone agreed that there were some areas in the Constitution that needed to be looked into in the future. That time is now," Ochieng said. The Movement for Democracy and Growth party leader said a review of the Constitution should be divorced from 2022 succession politics. "I know few things have worked for us in the Constitution but many are not in the right direction and that is why there is the need for a referendum to correct those issues," he said. Ochieng said the Building Bridges Initiative should be inclusive and not limited to only Jubilee and ODM alone. "Otherwise it will be Building Bridges to Intolerance." He said Siaya leaders expect the BBI to create a unity of purpose as promised by Raila and President Uhuru Kenyatta and not animosity. Wandayi urged politicians to shun early campaigns. He criticised those using the referendum push to create political formations ahead of the 2022 General Election. "Let us be focused on doing the right things at the right time for wananchi benefit instead of serving selfish interests," Wandayi said. He said it was unfortunate that politics had delayed the approval of the Revenue Allocation Bill, a situation that has left counties without funds. "This is the consequences of playing politics at the wrong time," Wandayi said.
