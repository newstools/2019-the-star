A court has directed that two passports belonging to billionaire Humphrey Kariuki be released to enable him to travel abroad for business engagements. Kariuki was arraigned in court last month for allegedly evading tax amounting to Sh41 billion. His Kenyan and Cypriot passports had been deposited in court when he was granted bail by chief magistrate Francis Andayi. On Thursday, magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot directed the release of the travel documents, saying Kariuki voluntarily produced himself to investigators. He said Kariuki has demonstrated a willingness to cooperate and attend court and there is no reason to restrict his business meetings. “I direct that his two passports be released to him to allow him to travel abroad as may be necessary, but let the accused provide surety to guarantee his return to court,” the magistrate said. Kariuki, through lawyer Cecil Miller, had urged the court to allow him to travel to the United States, Gabon and Switzerland for urgent business meetings between September 23 and December 6. The case will be mentioned on September 26. (Edited by F'Orieny)
