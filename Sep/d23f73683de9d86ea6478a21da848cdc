A businessman will be charged with tax evasion in excess of Sh1 billion at the Mombasa law courts. KRA said Abdi Gedi Amin was arrested on Thursday in Mombasa for being involved in a massive tax evasion syndicate. The taxman said the suspect will be charged with several counts including failure to pay taxes, to file returns and giving false information that affects tax liability for two companies and himself. KRA said in a statement on Friday that the offences contravene Section 97(c) as read with Section 104(3) of the Tax Procedures Act 2015. Abdi is alleged to have formed more than seven companies where he is either a director or used proxies to manage the firms, including being bank signatories. The companies have been trading as manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers in household commodities including sugar, oils, general goods to transport services. The companies are spread across Mombasa and Nairobi. The suspect spent Thursday night in police custody awaiting to take a plea. KRA said it is committed to facilitating taxpayers to pay and file their taxes as part of their civil duty toward making the country self-sustainable.
