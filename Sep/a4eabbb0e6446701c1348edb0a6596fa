Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has maintained that the ongoing Grade 3 assessment across the country is meant to test the ability of a pupil. He said it should not be perceived as examination, adding that the outcome will be used by teachers as pupils move to the next class to know where more attention is needed at. “ I think Kenyans love examinations. Please forget about it. This is not an exam,” Magoha said. The CS spoke on Friday in Thika when he toured the area to assess the ongoing Knec assessment tests. He said the test is only being done in Mathematics, English and Integrated Learning activities which are meant to test a child's holistic skills (interaction, problem-solving, observation and critical thinking). The CS ruled out the perception that downloading content for children is going to be expensive to parents. “I have seen that children have already downloaded what they were learning. But as a teacher, you do not need to photocopy for everyone. You can take one and come and write it on the blackboard,” the CS added. The assessment according to the CS will continue during the entire part of the third term. This is the first assessment test in the new Competency-Based Curriculum which kicked off this year. Knec had announced last month plans to review the success and problems of the new curriculum in Grade 3. The Kenya Early Years Assessment (Keya) will be administered to all learners in this grade and will test three English, Mathematics and Integrated Learning.
