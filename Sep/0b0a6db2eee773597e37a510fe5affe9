A police file in a case in which a Catholic University of East Africa dean is charged with beating up his female colleague is missing, the court has been told. The matter came up for the last hearing on Friday and an investigating officer from Hardy police station was scheduled to testify. “Your honour, the police file has not been provided again and this is intentional,” said state counsel Nancy Kerubo. She urged the court to issue summons to the officer in charge so that he appears in court in person and testifies. Key witness have testified and it is only the investigating officer who is yet to testify before a ruling is delivered. In the case, Samuel Nderitu,  a dean in the department of social sciences  is accused of beating up his colleague Rosa Ko after the two disagreed on the increased number of untrained instructors in the institution. A charge sheet in a Kibera court indicated that Nderitu committed the offence on October 3 last year at the university in Karen. Rosa reported the matter at the Hardy police station and after investigations, the accused was arrested. Rosa was by then the assistant professor in International Relations. She was fired after the incident. Nderitu denied the charges and was freed on Sh30,000 bail or a Sh50,000 bond with a surety of the same amount. Rosa has already testified together with the police doctor. A police report had also been filed in court.
