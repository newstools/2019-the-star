Former Kenya Sevens skipper Andrew Amonde leads a star-studded Dream Team named after the Stanbic-sponsored National Sevens Circuit in Mombasa. The experienced forward played a pivotal role as KCBÂ  won four out of six tournaments to win the national Sevens title for the first time since 2014. He is joined in the forwards by Kenya Sevens International Vincent Onyala who finished the circuit as the top try scorer of the circuit with 27 tries. Monate Akuei, who was a revelation for Nakuru, makes the cut following a sterling season for the Rift valley-based side. The rangy tall forward also made his debut for the Kenya Simbas in the Elgon and Victoria Cup respectively and demonstrated his versatility in both the Sevens and 15's game. Top points scorer on the circuit Tony Omondi is listed in the squad after a spectacular performance for Mwamba, where he finished with 181 points from the six tournaments played. Oilers' Davis Nyaundi was the standout player for the Nakuru-based outfit and consistently performed for Gibson Weru's charges. Levi Amunga who joined KCB during the transfer window from Blak Blad and Mwamba's flying winger Joel Inzuga complete the season dream team. Attention now switches to the 15's season with the Impala Floodlit tournament starting on September 28 and ending on October 12 at the Impala Club. The Safari Sevens will follow a week later from October 18-20 at the RFUEA ground. The Kenya Cup season will then kick off on October 26 at various grounds across the country.  standings 1.
