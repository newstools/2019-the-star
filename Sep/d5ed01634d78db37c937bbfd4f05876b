At least 300 teachers from Murang'a county have been trained on how to guide students to make the right career choices. The training, a partnership between Pioneer International University,  the Education ministry and the Murang’a Secondary Schools Heads Association, was meant for heads of career departments. The university’s vice chancellor Gideon Maina said the training held on Saturday at the Murang'a campus is to ensure teachers help students choose fulfilling careers. “We also wanted to see how parents can be involved in the process as it is the interest of many to guide their children on careers,” he said. He said it is important for secondary schools to partner with universities to ensure the smooth transition of their students after their secondary education. “Our university has been partnering with industries so that our graduates acquire the skills they require for the job market. But are secondary schools partnering with universities?” he asked. He said the Jubilee government’s Big Four agenda will not be achieved if students are not appropriately guided on the right career paths. The Kessha county chairperson Esther Wambugu said they had realised that many students keep migrating from one course to another even after scoring good grades in secondary school. This wastes a lot of their time and parents’ resources as they struggle to figure out their preferred careers. “That is when we realised the impact we would make by training teachers who are charged with the role of assisting students to choose their preferred courses,” Wambugu said. The county principal education officer Peter Ithili said the training was organised at a time when Form 2 students are about to choose the subjects they will specialize in from Form 3. “They have been given a guideline on how to suggest appropriate career choices for students who score grade A to E,” he said.
