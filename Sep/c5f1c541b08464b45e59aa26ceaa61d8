An evil granny who lured a four-year-old girl into his house and defiled her has been found guilty. Muthua Dominic, 89, was found guilty by Kibera Senior Principal Magistrate Esther Boke after the prosecution called several witnesses and closed the case. Dominic defiled a four-year-old girl in March 2017, in Hardy area within Nairobi County. The minor had told the court that Muthua forced her to climb on his bed and forced her to sleep on his tummy. “He laughed towards me and told me to sleep on his tummy and removed my clothes,” she told the court. He also forced his manhood inside her private parts. Her mother found her daughter crying in pain and decided to inspect her to know what was ailing her when she realised that she had some whitish jelly on her trouser. She took the child to Nairobi Women hospital where she was treated and a P3 form was filled due to the injuries she had sustain. Yesterday, the old rapist refused to mitigate but chanted that God was above all and asked God to bless the magistrate. He also said that he has been attending court sessions for some years now and was ready for anything. The magistrate directed that he avail himself on November 4 for mitigation.
