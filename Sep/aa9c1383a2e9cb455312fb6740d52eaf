A drunk policeman who beat up and broke the rib of a tout at the Kwa Vonza Bus stage in Kitui Rural subcounty will be prosecuted. Kitui Rural subcounty police commander Charles Chacha said on Tuesday that constable Benard Riziki will be charged with assault. “We are working on the P3 form for the victim of the assault before the culprit is charged in court,” Chacha said. Chacha said the officer was free on bond but once the  P3 form in finalised, he will be presented before a Kitui court. “Members of the public should stop being anxious. We will definitely charge the policeman for the law to take its course,” he added. Assault victim Alfred Mutua told the press at Kwa Vonza market that he wanted to see the policeman punished as he attacked and assaulted him without provocation. “I want Justice. He attacked me for no cause at all. It will take time for me to heal and he has rendered me out of work,” Mutua said. Mutua said the drunk policeman had pretended to arrested him around 4pm on Monday but pounced on him with heavy kicks and blows leaving him hurting all over the body and with a broken rib. “After handcuffing me, he took me to a secluded Kitui county cess kiosk were he started beating me with a wooden plank. He also used kicks and blows until I passed out,” Mutua said. He said he only gained consciousness as he was being rushed to hospital by a good Samaritan. Taxi driver Wilson Nzoka who operates along the Kwavonza -Kanyanngi route took the injured tout to a private hospital in Kitui town about 20 kilometres away. He said an X-ray established that Mutua had suffered a fractured rib in the left side. He said his compassionate action cost him at least Sh9,000 including medical charges and transport to the hospital. (edited by O. Owino)
