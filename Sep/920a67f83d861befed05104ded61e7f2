The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority has notified gas cylinder retailers and wholesalers to acquire licenses for their business or else they will be punished. All LPG cylinder retailers, wholesalers and transporters will be required to own a license that will indicate the business location and the authorised specific cylinder brand. EPRC said they will not undertake the business of retail, wholesale, and transportation of cylinders of another brand without prior written consent from the brand owner. "Failure to adhere to the regulations will be considered an offence and will lead to serious repercussions," EPRC said in a notice on Friday. One will be liable to a jail term not less than five years and a fine of not less than Sh5 million or both. In such a case the operating license might be withdrawn from the victim. This comes after gas cylinders from other brands were found at Pro Gas firm after a video and images went viral on social media last month.
