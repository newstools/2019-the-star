Thousands of Kenyans participated in the second UNHCR Step for Safety annual walk on Sunday. The event was in support of refugees who have been displaced because of conflict and persecution in the East African region and across Africa. It is an initiative of UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agencyâ€™s LuQuLuQu campaign. The campaign draws attention to the plight of forcibly displaced people and strives to change the public perception of the refugee narrative by highlighting their resilience.
