Nairobians will have to dig deeper into their pockets after the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority introduced an increase in fuel prices in its latest review. EPRA on Saturday announced Super petrol and Diesel prices will increase by Sh0.28 per litre and Sh2.44 per litre respectively starting midnight today in Nairobi. The users of Kerosene, however, can breathe a sigh of relief as its prices will decrease by Sh3.31 per litre in Nairobi. In a statement, the authorityÂ announced that Super Petrol, Diesel and Kerosene will now retail at Sh112.81, Sh103.04 and Sh100.64 respectively in Nairobi. In the port city of Mombasa, the prices will stand at Sh110.19, Sh100.44, and Sh98.03 for Super, Diesel and Kerosene respectively. In Eldoret and the lakeside city of Kisumu, the prices will be Sh113.30, Sh103.74 and Sh102.35 for the three categories respectively. The fuel categories will retail in Nakuru at Sh113.30, Sh103.74 and Sh1101.35 respectively. It explained that the changes were due to various rise in the cost of import as well as the slight depreciation of the Kenyan shilling relative to the US dollar. "The landed cost of Diesel increased by 4.38 per cent from US$ 482.47 per cubic metre to US$ 503.61 per cubic metre and Kerosene decreased by 5.61 per cent from US$ 513.10 per cubic metre to US$ 484.29 per cubic metre," it said. Over the same period, it explained, the mean monthly US Dollar to Kenya Shilling exchange rate depreciated by 0.13% from Sh103.31 per US$ in July 2019 to Sh103.44 per US$ in August 2019. "The pump prices are inclusive of 8% Value Added Tax (VAT) in line with the provisions of the Finance Act 2018 and the revised rates for excise duty adjusted for inflation as per Legal Notice No. 109 of 9th July 2019," it said. The statement signed by the agency's chief executive Robert Oimeke said that the objective of the regulations is to take care of the interest of both the consumers and investors in the energy sector.
