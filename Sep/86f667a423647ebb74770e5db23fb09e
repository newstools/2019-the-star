A Kiambu MCA has urged county's largely inhabited by Kikuyus to start recognising cultural activities. Lari Kirenga MCA Joseph Karichu said the Kikuyu culture is rich with traditions and literature, adding that many generations might not get time to learn about it. Karichu said although about 10 counties are occupied by the Kikuyu community, children are brought up in a modern way and might forget about their culture. "This is not about being tribal, but the appreciation of our culture. We need to show and teach our children and youths this culture and that they need to know and even practice it," he said. He urged the chairman of the Central governors, Francis Kimemia, who is also the Nyandarua county boss to consider discussing the issue with his colleagues. Karichu spoke at Githirioni, when he accompanied Kimemia to visit the area retired chief Joseph Thiong'o. The MCA also urged Kimemia to speak with governors to set aside some funds for cultural activities. Kimemia said he will table the issue before the Central governors' meeting. He urged Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko to join the Central Kenya bloc. "Kikuyus living in Nairobi makes about 60 per cent of its population, and we feel the need to include that county in the Central block" he said. Kimemia applauded Karichu for proposing an activity of seeing Kikuyu community learning its culture.
