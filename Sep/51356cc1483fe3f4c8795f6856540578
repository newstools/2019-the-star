A case where a man is accused of stealing a gun from his employer in Karen turned abusive on Wednesday after the accused asked why he was blamed for the offense. Complainant Francis Njoroge angrily roared at Samuel Mwangi, dismissing his greetings with insults, prompting the presiding magistrate to call for restraint. Njoroge blamed Mwangi for his tribulations with the authorities over the stolen gun. "Stop playing around with my mind. I was given this machine even before your mother was born. That is a stupid question without an answer," responded Njoroge when asked to confirm that Mwangi was the thief. Njoroge said on March 24, last year he woke up early and left  for work. At around 9am, the house help called informing him that all the houses in his compound had been broken into and some items stolen. "I hurriedly left to go check and found my house and the servants quarter all broken into. My pistol, clothes and other items were missing," he told court. "I proceeded to Hardy police station and reported the matter. I informed the police that the main suspect would be the accused, Mwangi, who worked as my gardener." Police launched an investigation where Mwangi was implicated in the theft of a firearm, clothes, shoes and other property. The accused was arrested in Narok and arraigned on November 18, 2018. Mwangi was charged with stealing items valued at Sh310,000. Appearing before Kibera senior principal magistrate Barbara Ojoo, Mwangi denied the charges and was granted Sh100,000 cash bail. The hearing continues on November 8.
