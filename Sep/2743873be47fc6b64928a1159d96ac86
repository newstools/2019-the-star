Knut Secretary General Wilson Sossion will remain in office, a Labour court has ruled. The Employment and Labour relations Judge Hellen Wasilwa on Tuesday said the union's National Executive Council acted in contempt of court when they convened a meeting to oust Sossion. In the case, Sossion's rival Hesborn Otieno claimed that on August 29, Knut through its NEC members resolved to expel Sossion in accordance with the unions Constitution. The resolution was done by all the 29 members who attend the meeting. The court heard that NEC made the decision based on Sossionâ€™s unbecoming conduct.
