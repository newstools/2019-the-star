Lionel Messi has urged Barcelona to give Ansu Fati and Carles Perez chances to shine this season, according to reports. Barcelona bolstered their squad this summer with the big-money £108million transfer of Antoine Griezmann. But according to Diario Gol, Messi believes the club should hand a key role to two of their most exciting youngsters in Fati and Perez. Fati became Barcelona’s youngest ever goalscorer on Saturday when he netted in the 2-2 draw against Osasuna in La Liga. Meanwhile, Perez caught the eye during pre-season for the Spanish giants and has made two league starts already this campaign. And Messi, who is out with a calf injury still, has reportedly called on Ernesto Valverde to trust the two youngsters from the off.
