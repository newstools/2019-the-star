Limuru MP Peter Mwathi has claimed that a private developer was planning to grab land set aside for the subcounty police headquarters in the town. “We were forced to place a notice indicating that this is the divisional police headquarters. The police have also built two offices and a lavatory is being set up,” he said. The legislator added that businesses were using the open field as a market for building materials such as sand, stones, timber, woods among other items. He said his office is working with the Ministry of Lands to investigate all alleged grabbed lands in the area. Mwathi said some of the lands have allegedly been developed or even sold to unsuspecting people. He said the government has been finding it difficult to get enough land for projects that will benefit the public because they have been stolen or encroached on. “We have no space left for land grabbers. Days are few for those who really know the lands they are occupying are stolen since the government will soon repossess them” he warned. A businessman Joseph Njenga says that the police station will help boost security in the town and its environs. However, the legislator has appealed to residents to report lands alleged to have been grabbed to his office for action to be taken.
