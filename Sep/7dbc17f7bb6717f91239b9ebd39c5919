Kenya was on Tuesday elected the United Nation World Tourism Organisation Executive Council member representing Africa at the just-ended 62nd Commission for Africa meeting at the UNWTO general assembly in St Petersburg, Russia. The country will represent the continent until 2023 at the global tourism summit. The Kenyan delegation lobbied to host the 24th UNWTO 2021 General Assembly in Kenya on the road to make Kenya a leading Meetings, Incentives, Conferencing & Exhibitions (MICE) centre. The main aim for the African nations meeting at the UNWTO 62nd CAF is to build on the Agenda 4 Africa that will outline on the actions to be taken to realise sustainable tourism throughout the continent within set timelines. Kenya faced stiff competition against Morocco and Philippines in the battle to host the 24th UNWTO General Assembly in 2021. Tourism CS said they are going to make a solid case for Kenya to host the 24th UNWTO General Assembly meeting in 2021 as the first East African country to do so. "We will build on the success of recently hosted high-level global events in Kenya as a strong reason why Kenya should be voted as hosts for the upcoming meeting and hope to secure the victory,” CS Balala said. Kenya was looking at leveraging its vast past experience in hosting top global events to make a case for the event to be hosted here in 2021. This is in line with the Ministry’s long-term strategy to diversify the tourism product.
