Tanzanian singer Nandy says she got pregnant for Bill Nass while she was still dating the rapper, but unfortunately suffered a miscarriage days later. In an interview with ‘Times FM,’ the 'Ninogeshe' hitmaker added that she was super excited to become a mother, but the joy was short-lived. "I will not dwell on that but yes, I was pregnant for him but I suffered a miscarriage. He brought me some medicines which I took, and they led to my miscarriage." Nandy said Bill Nass might have intentionally bought the medicines for that effect, but it’s the past and she has forgiven him. "I was excited about the pregnancy and of course I was hurt when I had a miscarriage," she said. She is currently hitting the headlines with 'Kiza Kinene' featuring Sauti Sol.
