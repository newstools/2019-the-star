President Uhuru Kenyatta is scheduled to attend former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's burial on Sunday. Mugabe died on Friday last week at the age of 95 while undergoing treatment at a Singapore hospital. His body was flown back to Zimbabwe on Wednesday and Zimbabweans lined up in the streets of Harare to catch a glimpse of the hearse being taken to his home. Uhuru had ordered that the Kenyan flag be flown half-mast for three days in honour of Mugabe. He eulogised MugabeÂ as courageous, dedicated and a fighter who fought for his nation. Former presidents Daniel Moi and Mwai Kibaki joined other leaders in mourning his death. The President will join other dignitaries from Africa and beyond in Zimbabwe. Mugabe ruled for 37 years before being ousted in November 2017 by the military.
