Inspector General of police Hillary Mutyambai on Thursday attended the East African Police Chiefs Cooperation Organization (EAPCCO) AGM in Tanzania. The police chief was accompanied by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) director George Kinoti, among other senior officers from Kenya Police Service, Administration Police Service, and the DCI who are members of Counter-Terrorism, Gender, training, Legal and cybercrime committees. The meeting helps police chiefs develop strategies to fight transnational organised crimes, develop and sign MoU, network, and share experiences and best practices. The AGM was officially opened by Tanzania Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa. During the meeting, outgoing EAPCCO first chairman Lt. Gen. Adil Mohammed, who is the Director-General of the Sudan Police Forces, handed over the chairmanship to Simon Nyakoro Sirro â€” the Inspector General of the Tanzania Police Force. Others in attendance were Interpol Secretary-General Jurgen Stock and police chiefs from Rwanda, Ethiopia, Burundi, Seychelles, Sudan and representatives of IGPs from other East African Countries. Transnational organised crime is coordinated across national borders, involving groups or markets of individuals working in more than one country to plan and execute illegal business ventures. In order to achieve their goals, these criminal groups use systematic violence and corruption.
