Leonardo is reportedly tired of the speculation surrounding the Brazilian’s future and wants to offload him in January. The 27-year-old had agreed to stay with the reigning Ligue 1 giants until next summer. Barcelona were favourites all summer to sign him with Neymar preferring a return to his former club. Real Madrid also have expressed an interest which could spark a bidding war in the January transfer window. Neymar’s father has said negotiations between PSG and Barcelona are far from over. Neymar senior told Fox Sports: ‘The negotiations between the two clubs (were) not over. “A Brazilian just wants to be happy where he is and he was very happy (in Barcelona). “When his friends asked him if he would come back, he was moved.”
