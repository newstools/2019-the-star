Slain city tycoon Tob Cohen's body was on Tuesday afternoon moved from Chiromo morturary to the Jewish cemetery on Wangari Maathai Road for the final rites. The burial failed to take place on Monday as planned after widow Sarah Wambui’s lead lawyer Philip Murgor said there was lack of quorum of priests because only eight of them instead of 10 showed up at the graveyard which had been prepared. “Tob Cohen's burial has been postponed to tomorrow [today] 2.30pm. Only eight priests out of the required 10 priests and a Rabbi, according to Jewish customs, were present” Murgor said. Wairimu attended the ceremony on Tuesday. The Dutch billionaire's body was found last Friday afternoon — eight weeks after his disappearance —in an empty underground water tank at his Kitisuru residence. His body was wrapped in many layers of black plastic. Cohen was reported missing from his Lower Kabete home in Nairobi between July 19 and July 20.
