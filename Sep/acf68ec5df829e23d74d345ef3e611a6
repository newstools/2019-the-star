NGOs will provide grants to Homa Bay Homa farmers that form groups and will teach them modern agriculture methods. County executive for Agriculture Aguko Juma said on Monday that financial assistance would help the farmers improve production. Juma said the county has signed agreements with three donors to support potato, maize, cassava, poultry, fish, cotton and dairy farming. He said the NGOs require that farmers form groups to be eligible for grants, training and scholarships. “One of the supports is buying farm inputs for groups," Juma said. Speaking to journalists in Lambwe during Agriculture Field Day in Suba North constituency, the executive also urged farmers to submit proposals for grants. “It makes sense for farmers to form groups by location for easy management. Their proposals should focus on what they do best, such as potato farming," Juma said. Juma and chairman for Locational and Economic Development Forum chairman Charles Orero said extension officers will contact farmers in the field and spread the word. “We want farmers to get an education in various agricultural activities at their farms, especially in their groups to ensure food production improves," Juma said. Orero urged the farmers to adopt modern agriculture to improve their income. He said his organisation will provide training on updated skills. “We’ll also identify farmers for agricultural scholarship programmes,” he said. (Edited by V. Graham)
