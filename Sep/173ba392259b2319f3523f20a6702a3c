A  class six girl recalled in a Kibera court how a sheikh repeatedly defiled her for three years after luring her with gifts. After every defilement, the religious man threatened to kill Anjela (not her real name) if she disclosed what he had done to her. “He vowed to kill me if I tell anyone,” the 13-year-old girl told senior resident magistrate Renee Kitagwa. Eventually, she told her ordeal to "Mum Pamela" (a neighbour). “Mum Pamela is a supportive woman.” Suleiman allegedly committed the offence between 2016 and this year. A medical report from Nairobi Women's Hospital showed that the girl had bruises on her private parts, an indication of frequent and violent defilement. Suleiman maintained that he never committed the offence. The case will proceed on October 2.
