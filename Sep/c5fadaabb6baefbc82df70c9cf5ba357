Detectives are zeroing on top managers at Mombasa Port for arrest as they conclude a three-week corruption investigation. Sixteen senior managers have recorded statements with the police. While top police chiefs were mum on pending arrests, intelligence sources indicated that among those to be arrested include a former MD and a  current general manager, who is said to have pocketed more than Sh30 million in a ship salvage deal. He is also sought over alleged authorisation of payment of millions of shillings to a private company. The taxpayer lost Sh14 billion after the cost of the Kipevu Oil Terminal was inflated from Sh26 billion to Sh40 billion. All members of the KPA’s tendering and evaluation committee led by chairman Rashid Salim recorded statements with detectives between March 4 and March 8. We could not get a comment from DCI boss George Kinoti yesterday as phone calls and texts were unanswered. Panic has gripped the port with reports that some top managers and procurement staff may be arrested either today or tomorrow.
