The police are seeking to detain six more suspects linked to the Sh72 million city heist. The suspects include three police officers; one corporal and two AP officers. The suspects are: Administration Police Chris Machogu, Corporal Duncan Kaveshi Luvuga, APC Boniface Mutua, Vincent Owuor, Alex Mutuku and Francis Muriuki. Police are seeking to detain the six at Lang'ata police station for seven days to complete investigations. Cliff Ombeta is one of the defense lawyers in the case. Ombeta opposed the application to detain the accused persons saying the police should have gathered enough evidence before arresting them. The police claim that the suspects need to be detained so as to search the suspects' houses, a move that the defense strongly opposed. Ombeta told the court that one of the corporals was beaten and sustained head injuries. According to the defense all their houses have already been searched and some of their mattresses and ceilings tampered with. "The police forced Vincent Owuor, one of the suspects to say he is a police officer yet he is not," the defense said. The defense insisted that the suspects require medical attention. Last Friday, seven suspects were also brought to a Milimani court and later detained at Lang'ata police station. The ruling on whether the suspects will be detained or not will be made on Monday at 2.30 pm.
