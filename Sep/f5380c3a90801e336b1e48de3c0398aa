President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of condolence and encouragement to the family, relatives and friends of former Lang’ata Member of Parliament Mwangi Mathai. Mwangi who was the ex husband to Environmentalist Wangare Maathai died at a Nairobi hospital while undergoing treatment. In his condolence message, Uhuru described the late Mwangi as a bold, brave and astute leader. He said Mwangi will be remembered as an entrepreneur who helped create jobs and employment opportunities for many Kenyans through his businesses. “We will forever be grateful to him for the efforts to empower Kenyans by creating job opportunities through his business ventures and opening up the minds of Kenyans through his book," Uhuru said. Besides politics and business, Mwangi was a consummate motivational writer who authored the book, "Beyond Poverty and Vulnerability in Kenya". Mwangi and professor Maathai got married in 1969. They had three children – Waweru, Wanjira and Muta – before their divorce in 1979. In her book "Unbowed: One Woman's Story", Maathai recounted that Mwangi's decision to leave her came as a surprise. The former Tetu MP spent three days in jail after confronting the judge who had been presiding over the divorce suit. Maathai was in 2004 honoured by the Nobel Peace Prize for her social, environmental and political activism. She died in 2011 and was cremated at the Kariokor Crematorium.
