A  woman, 22, is being held at Kyuso police station in Kitui county after she allegedly buried her newborn baby. Kyuso subcounty police commander Charles Machinji said Tabitha Mwikali Katunyo was arrested by residents on Monday night in Kathaalani village, Kamusiliu location. Mwikali is the daughter of a pastor, who is also a teacher at a local school. "Around 9pm on Monday night, chief Stephen Munyithya reported that Mwikali concealed the birth of her child. Police officers visited the area and arrested her and took the body of the newborn to Kyuso hospital morgue,” Machinji said. Machinji said she could have committed the act out of fear as "her father had warned that he would not allow her to bear another baby before marriage". He said village elder David Kithuiri was on Monday evening walking along a footpath when he saw a heap of fresh soil on the roadside. On close examination, he said, he discovered that an infant's body was buried there. He said it was not clear whether the child was buried alive or dead but the suspect would be subjected to a medical examination. Mwikali was on Tuesday scheduled for a medical examination at the Kyuso Level 4 Hospital awaiting arraignment. Edited by R.Wamochie
