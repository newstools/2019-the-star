A 12-year old girl is detained at the Kakamega County Referral Hospital over a Sh1 million bill. Her family in Busia has appealed for assistance to pay the hospital. Sakina Haji was referred to the hospital from Busia County General Hospital on April 28 with a condition that required surgery. Her grandfather, Mzee Haji Mwenengo, 69, said the bill accumulated from Sh800,000 since he left the hospital to look for assistance. “I stayed in the hospital for our months and spent the money I had on medicine demanded by the hospital. I left a month ago when I started feeling unwell because I am disabled and the long stay on hospital affected me,” Haji told the Star on Tuesday. “The hospital administration has become hostile and insists they don’t want to see anyone going there unless they are paying the bill. I am unable to raise half the money as demanded by the hospital.” Sakina was admitted with a perforated esophagus in critical condition. She had earlier sought treatment at Port Victoria and Busia County hospitals. Her grandparents have been her guardians since her mother was married but cannot assist. Efforts by members of the civil society to seek the release of the girl last month failed after hospital administrator Titus Mumia called the police to arrest them. A week ago, Mumia admitted that he had engaged Sakina's guardian and asked him to raise some cash before he could engage the hospital on arrangements for her release. “I am aware of the patient as I printed her interim bill. She has been staying in the ICU and you know how expensive it is to be in the facility. I asked the parent to find some money so we can talk about the patient,” he said. Patients have been complaining of high charges by the hospital which denies it detains patients over unpaid bills. Edited by R.Wamochie
