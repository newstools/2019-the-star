The Teachers Service Commission has started digitizing teachersâ€™ data for efficiency and safety of the valuable information. TSC director of quality assurance and standards Reuben Nthamburi said from November they will introduce digital files which will make it easy for teachers and stakeholders to save and retrieve data. Nthambuiri said digitization will be vital for communication from their offices for efficient service delivery. He said with digitization, which will ease storage and retrieval of teachers' data whenever needed, the question of lost files will be a forgotten. He spoke in Bomet during the TSC open day which brought together five counties. Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok and county TSC director Charles Nyaumah attended the event. Barchok asked the commission to send more teachers to the county saying Bomet was understaffed. Nthamburi this is the right time for digitalization as the new curriculum is being implemented by the government. The official said the process will include a messaging system for supervision of children by teachers and parents.
