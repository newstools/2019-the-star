Heavy traffic is expected over the weekend on Thika Superhighway at Allsops area, which will be closed for overpass construction. Concrete beams for the Outering Road overpass will be installed on Saturday and Sunday. Kenya Urban Road Authority acting director general Silas Silas Kinoti on Wednesday announced that the city-bound expressway will be closed on Saturday and Sunday. The remaining section of the outbound expressway will be closed on Saturday, September 21 and Sunday, September 22. Motorists heading to the city centre will use service lanes as directed by traffic marshals. The closure will disrupt traffic flow on the expressway. All vehicles heading out of Nairobi towards Thika and those joining or leaving Outering Road will have to squeeze into the two-lane Ruaraka overpass. ()Edited by V. Graham) KURA closed the overpass at General Service Unit headquarters when the construction started in April. It was mentioned that there has always been congestion at that junction and the roundabout, especially during rush hours. As a result, the authority looked at the design of Outer Ring Road and the Thika Superhighway and the only rational option was to construct an additional flyover. The junction has been a pain for users accessing Thika Road from Outer Ring and those trying to get onto the new road from the highway due to traffic congestion The new exchange is expected to improve Outer Ring Road and is seen as a game-changer for the Eastern part of Nairobi where high population density has led to heavy traffic.
