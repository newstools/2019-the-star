Kenya has officially qualified for the Davis Cup Euro/Africa Group II after beating Mozambique 2-0 in the playoffs of the tournament held at Nairobi Club. Ibrahim Kibet who had not featured in the singles during the group B matches played in the course of the week gave the Kenyan team a flying start , whipping the battling Bruno Nhavene 7'-6(6), 6-4. With a limb already into the next group, top seed Ismael Changawa affirmed in the second singles match outclassing Franco Mata in similar sets of 6-1. Kibet said he realized his mistakes on time and could not contain his joy after flooring his opponent. He said, "I knew the mistakes I made during the break and I worked to undo them. My opponent was not the kind that gives up easily, and neither was I, so I made sure I was always on the lead. It was my personal goal to get this win and I am glad I did."Head coach Rosemary Owino hailed Kibet for handling the pressure from Nhavene and his nearly error-free performance. " Anyone watching the match could sense the tension. Kibet was too tense and although that led to a few mistakes, I am glad that he managed to handle it well . "Changawa, on the other hand, noted that this year's edition was slightly competitive and tough as opposed to last year. " I am very happy that we have finally hit the target deservedly. The games were not easy and each one of us had to bring forth their best to ensure this win. Achieving this gives us motivation and confidence to look forward to competing even better. Personally, I played better than I did last year."
