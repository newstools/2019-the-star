A courageous driver yesterday saved Embu from a disaster after he sped off from a petrol station with burning fuel tanker. James  Kangara risked his life when he drove the tanker off Independent  Petrol Station at Rwika Town in Mbeere South subcounty. The tanker had mysteriously started flaming as he offloaded petrol into the station. Witnesses said that Kangara reacted quickly and drove off the tanker to a deserted area of the town when he saw fire emanating from a spot on the tank. Kangara managed to stop the tanker at a secure spot 200 meters away before he jumped out. The lorry burst into flames shortly afterwards and was reduced to a shell. The witnesses said there were no casualties and that the driver was not injured during the incident. Firefighters from Embu county rushed to the scene and put out the fire before it could spread further. Mbeere South subcounty Police Commander Ahmed Mohammed confirmed the incident. He said investigations into the incident had commenced and lauded Kangara over his courageous and selfless move. He said if the fire would have caught the petrol station it would have caused a big disaster at the shopping centre and lives would have been lost.
