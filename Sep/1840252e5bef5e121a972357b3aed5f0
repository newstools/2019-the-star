Nothing devastates a parent like losing a child. To mothers, it brings back memories of the labour pain and shatters their hopes of seeing them grow into responsible adults with their own families. Unfortunately, our country runs the risk of losing a future generation, thanks to dilapidated structures in both public and privates schools induced by get-rich-quick schemes and the lacklustre nature of both the government and the citizenry. In countries where laws and systems work, Education ministry officials and their counterparts in the housing department would have been sent packing for abdicating their roles that has seen eight innocent pupils die at Precious Talent Academy. Images of healthy-looking politicians and government officials clad in their expensive suits at the scene of the Monday morning tragedy appearing to empathise with the bereaved, and promising fire and brimstone on the owners of the school only rubs salt in the wound. We recently saw them say it doesn’t matter whether children study under trees so long as CBC, which they tout as a game-changer, is implemented. How heartless can they be?  What if it rains? Will learning stop? The MPs who visited the site shouldn’t dupe the country that they’ve never seen such buildings in the country. They'd rather preach their Tangatanga and Kieleweke gospels at the expense of the people who put them into those positions. They should debate bills to improve the condition of classrooms and schools before mooting bills like banning farting in the aeroplanes and regulating WhatsApp and Facebook groups. We must learn to become proactive as a country. If we fail to keep the government on its toes, it’s us, who suffer.  Via E-mail
