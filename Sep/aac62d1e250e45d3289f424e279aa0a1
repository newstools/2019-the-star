The woman who chopped off her husband's genitals has been denied bond by the High Court in Nakuru. Justice Joel Ngugi said Naomi Nyokabi does not have a fixed place of residence and is a flight risk. She was charged with murder and denied any wrongdoing. “Once released, she can abscond court. The court hereby directs that she be held in custody,” Ngugi said. This came after the state, through prosecution counsel Amos Chigiti, applied to have the accused person detained on grounds she fled the scene after the incident. She is alleged to have severed her 52-year-old husband’s genitals. He died while undergoing treatment at Rift Valley Provincial General Hospital. A postmortem report shows he also suffered injuries in his head and face, and his legs were swollen. The police believe the attack ensued after the suspect accused her husband of not providing for his family. The accused allegedly attacked her husband first with a club, before picking a kitchen knife and attacking his manhood. She was rescued by the police from an angry mob that bayed for his blood. The case will be mentioned on October 1. (Edited by F'Orieny)
