Sevilla sporting director Monchi has expressed his shock at Javier Hernandez’s move to the Spanish club given the Mexican’s wages at West Ham. The 31-year-old was thought to be on £145k (Sh18m) -a-week while playing at the London Stadium, but his salary at his new club is around £53k (Sh6.6m) -a-week. Monchi, speaking about the deal, said: “I wanted to sign him a long time ago and I must say that in my 20 years as a sports director I had never seen a football player lower his salary so much to sign for Sevilla. “Javier convinced me in the first talk we had,” Monchi continued. “He is an experienced forward who meets the requirements our coach wants.” The Mexican striker’s move to Spain, penning a three-year-contract, ends a two-year stay with the Hammers, during which he scored 17 goals in 63 appearances. Hernandez actually scored in his final appearance, at Brighton two weeks ago, but was not in the squad who beat Norwich on Saturday.  Last season, rumours of Hernandez’s lofty wage creating a ‘toxic’ atmosphere in the dressing room were rife. At that point, the only other player receiving a six-figure salary was Marko Arnautovic, who also left this summer, moving to Shanghai SIPG in China.
