One student died on the spot while scores sustained multiple injuries on Friday morning after a Taita Taveta University bus overturned at Josa, along Mwatate-Wundanyi Road. The bus was ferrying students from Ngerenyi Campus to the university’s main campus at Mariwenyi in Voi. It had 29 students on board and two staff members during the 8:30am accident. The student who died was male and aged 19. Seven students were critically injured and rushed to Moi County Referral Hospital in Voi and St. Joseph Shetter of Hope in Voi, according to the police. Another 24 were treated with bruises and minor injuries at Mwatate Hospital. “The driver negotiated a sharp corner at Josa when he lost control, veered off the road and rolled severally into a valley,” Mwatate subcounty police commander Monicah Kimani said. Kimani said police had launched further investigations into the cause of the accident. “We had already towed the wreckage to Mwatate police station,” she said. Witness Jason Mwabili said the breaks of the bus might have failed while descending the steep Josa hill. He called the government to erect safety barriers along the area that has been notorious with accidents. “We have lost many lives here and the government should think of putting strong rails along the road. Drivers should also be cautioned to slow down while coming from Wundanyi,” Mwabili said. Last year, two people were killed and 26 others injured when a bus they were travelling in rolled down the same area. The body was taken to Moi Hospital morgue awaiting postmortem.
