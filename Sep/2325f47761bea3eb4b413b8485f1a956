Nameless and Wahu celebrated 14 years in marriage yesterday. The two got married on September 10, 2005, in a wedding themed on traditional attire. Speaking to Word Is about the secret behind a successful marriage, Wahu said it all has been by the grace of God and understanding what each other likes and dislikes. She wrote, "It's our 14th wedding anniversary! Where did the time go! What can I say, babe? We've laughed, cried, fought, made up, made money, lost money, agreed, disagreed, and throughout this rollercoaster called life, I've always known I can count on you. My best friend, lover, cheerleader. My ride or die. Thank you for loving me with all my imperfections. Here's to 100 more!" Nameless shared a video of their wedding and captioned, "14 years si mcheso. Happy 14th-anniversary teammate! RideOrDie"
