China began the 70th anniversary of its independence on Thursday, with exhibitions, culture show and live music played by both Kenyan and Chinese artists, climaxing in an award ceremony of China-Kenya friendship photography. The commemoration was held at the Chinese Embassy in Nairobi and was presided over by Ambassador Wu Peng. It was organised by the Beijing NGO Association for International Exchanges, in conjunction with the Peopleâ€™s Government of China. The anniversary is meant to showcase China's extraordinary rise from the ravages of war and famine to a modern, powerful nation-state presented by the embassy and Chinese enterprises.
