National Super League debutants Northern Wanderers are keen to overcome their last week predicament which saw six of their players opt-out and pull surprises in their subsequent matches. Wanderers were on the receiving end of police brutality on the eve of their opener against Nairobi Stima last weekend, where their rented house in Buru Buru was raided severally by the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit for allegedly being suspected aliens. The Garissa-based club which was admitted to the second tier to fill in the void left the defunct Eldoret Youth had most of their players arrested last week apparently for failing to cooperate with the enumerators conducting the census exercise and appeared suspects to the neighbours. The Noordin Badel-coached outfit lost 8-0 to Stima in the opening match played at Camp Toyoyo and despite the mauling, the club is psyched up to find their winning touch in their next assignments. “At the moment, we are focusing on our next matches. It’s unfortunate we have lost six players who opted to return home for fear of police harassment but we have depth. We are planning for our next matches and I am confident that we will pull surprises,” he said. Badel rued lack of approved sporting facilities in Garissa as the team will be forced to play their home matches at Toyoyo, denying them home comfort and fan base support. He said they have settled on relocating to Nairobi where they will be training twice a week owing to the congestion at Toyoyo from clubs which also train there. “We do not have an accredited stadium to host our matches in Garissa but we will be using Toyoyo. It is a challenge as we only train twice a week due to congestion at the facility. Another great challenge we are facing is player fitness but I believe that will be sorted before our next game.”
