Child star Wendy Waeni's former manager, Joe Mwangi, has been arrested. According to a tweet by DCI on Monday, Mwangi will be charged once the necessary police process is complete. The DCI thanked Kenyans for sharing information on Mwangi's whereabouts. Mwangi is accused of exploiting Waeni. Detectives based at Child Protection Unit started probing the matter last month after Waeni appeared on Citizen TV and said she and her mother were living in poverty despite her performing across the world. Waeni said, " I have performed all over the world but Iâ€™ve never gotten a penny from it and that is because of my previous manager." The girl said she lived in a single room with her mother in Nairobi's Huruma estate. Wendy is a gymnast and Unicef Ambassador and has performed for Presidents Uhuru Kenyatta and Paul Kagame of Rwanda. Wendy said her mother sells sweets and cigarettes late at night to raise money to pay rent. However, during an interview with Radio Jambo, Waeni's mother acknowledge Mwangi did give her "a little money".
