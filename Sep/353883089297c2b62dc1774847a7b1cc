A man in Lugari has accused his second wife of bewitching him and his children. Isaac Nyongesa said he stumbled on cartons in a dark corner in their house in Lunyito village on Saturday after his second wife Margaret Nabwire fled the home on his arrival. He said that his wife of more than 20 years, with whom he has five children developed a habit running away from the house whenever he went there. “This time I arrived and she left me alone in the house. I decided to search the house to know why she flees whenever I visited. To my surprise, I stumbled on what I did not believe,” he told a bemused crowd that gathered in his compound. “I was shocked to find my coat and tie which have been missing for a long time tied in herbs and dusted with ashes." He said in the recent past they have been engaging in endless feuds with his second wife forcing him to spend most of his time with the first wife. But whenever he went back to the second wife she ran away and only returned when he had left. Among the items recovered were blankets, women's underpants, children clothes, hair, books, foodstuffs, condoms and nails. Nyongesa said the blankets and nails belonged to his daughter and grandchildren. “This woman has even bewitched me and my children. My brother died five years ago and after his burial I took one of his coats and a tie which I used for few weeks then they went missing. Today I am shocked to find them here tied with herbs and sprinkled with ashes,” said Nyongesa. Some of the villagers found their lost items tied in herbs and sprinkled with ashes. An elderly woman from the neighbouring village broke down in tears after she found charcoal wrapped in her petticoat that got lost years ago. The angry villagers vowed to lynch the woman if she returned to the village. But Nyongesa said he would not allow her back in his home.
