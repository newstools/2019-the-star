The national women's football team 'Harambee starlets' will play Ghana on October 4 away in the Olympic Qualifiers third round. The side, under the stewardship of David Ouma, will then welcome the West Africans for the return leg on October 8. Kenya beat Malawi 5-3 on aggregate in the second round early this month at the Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos to set a date with Ghana who saw off Gabon 5-0 in the one-sided encounter. Starlets will be hoping to build on their last performance against Ghana where they played to a 1-1 all draw during the friendly match at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani last year. Football Kenya Federation (FKF)  official Ken Okaka said the team is expected to assemble on Sunday before starting residential training ahead of their departure on October 2. He said: “I really can't comment on the team. It's coaches prerogative to give us the names of the players he would have picked. As to whether there will be new additional it's upon him but what I know is that the team will assemble on Sunday to  start training ahead of the Ghana tie.”
