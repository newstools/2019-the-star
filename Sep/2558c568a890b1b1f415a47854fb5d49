Muhoroni MP Onyango Koyoo has criticised poll losers who use names of other leaders to solicit for money from elected leaders. Koyoo on Tuesday said some politicians have perfected the narrative of “preparing the ground" to get money under the pretext that the ground is hostile. “We have cases where some cartels manipulate leaders to give them money in order to talk to those in the perceived hostile areas they plan to visit,” Koyoo said. The lawmaker warned the politicians he did not name to stop and focus on uniting residents towards the realisation of development. Koyoo urged leaders in Kisumu to unite and stop divisive politics which hinders development. He said leaders should stop spreading propaganda and hate speech, telling them to focus on developing the region. Residents want development that can improve their living standards, he said. “You cannot create a problem and then avert it by spreading lies against other leaders for monetary gains.” The lawmaker added, “We must not go against the will of the voters. We should respect each other in our own capacity." Koyoo told those eying his seat that voters will elect someone who has brought them development. Edited by R.Wamochie
