Artistes are working hard to keep alive the legacy of the late Kikuyu Benga singer John De Mathew, says Ben Githae. De Mathew died in a car crash two weeks ago. "We have a plan as artistes to visit the family, and the projects he had started will also be running as smoothly as when he was alive," Githae told Word Is yesterday. He said on October 13, they will have a remembrance day for him at Kenol to lay a foundation as his remembrance. Central Kenya musicians will remember him as one of the brains behind the sacco known as the Talented Musicians and Composers Association (Tamco). The sacco has 300 shareholders. Two weeks before his death, De Mathew was in Embu to support young people through his project DeMathew Mashinani. He supported women and promised to go back.
