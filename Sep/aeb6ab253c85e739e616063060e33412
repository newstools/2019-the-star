Police in Eldoret have arrested three people in connection with motor vehicle thefts. More than 300 vehicles have been stolen in the North Rift town in the past six months, according to Uasin Gishu county commander Johnstone Ipara. Motorists fear leaving their vehicles in parking lots in the town. On Tuesday, Ipara said police are looking for more suspects. “We have so far arrested suspects who are either involved directly or through other networks and we are looking for more,” he said. He said the crackdown has been spread to Kericho, Nakuru, Iten and other areas. The thieves' main targets are salons, matatus and lorries. Ipara warned garage owners and spare part dealers of arrest if found dealing with parts from dismantled cars. Stolen vehicles are either dismantled or repainted and fitted with fake number plates. Meanwhile,  Uasin Gishu MCAs have rejected a motion seeking to have free reserved parking for prominent people in Eldoret. The motion had been moved by nominated MCA Leah Mallot. She is a former athlete.
