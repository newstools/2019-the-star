City businessman Stephen Mark Oduk was charged on Friday in a Nairobi court for being in possession of fake $100 million following an ongoing gold scam raid. Oduk appeared before Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi and denied two counts of being in possession of forgery papers in preparation to commit a felony. The court heard that on Wednesday at Plan 254 Restaurant along Nyangumi Road in Kilimani, Nairobi, and without lawful authority or exercise, he had in his possession 1,000,000 papers intended to resemble papers used in making US dollars. In the second count, Oduk was accused of being in possession of 1 million papers on similar dates and place, intended to resemble and pass as special papers such as those provided and used in making US currency notes. This, according to court papers, indicated that he was intending to commit an offence of cheating. Oduk was arrested on September 26 at his Plan 254 Club in Kilimani, in connection with Sh100 million fake dollars found in his club. DCI officers allegedly recovered other items, including 147 bars of fake gold in the early morning raid. Oduk was granted him Sh1 million bond, with an alternative Sh500,000 bail. The case will be mentioned on October 7 and heard on October 30. Four years ago, Steve Oduk, alias Lucas Mbadi, painted the town red when he threw a party for his lover, Aeedah Bambi. Oduk made arrangements to rent out the entire club so his lover could celebrate her 20th birthday in an exclusive environment. The couple was also clad in matching golden attires, which cost some Sh290,000. It is said businessmen Paul Kobia, Jared Otieno, Babu Owino, Fundi Frank, Chris Obure, and Owago Onyiro were among the 200 guests at the party.
