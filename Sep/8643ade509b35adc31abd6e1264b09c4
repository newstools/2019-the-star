Ashiner Pictures was named in honour of actor and producer Ashina Kibibi, CEO Ann Hamberger has said. Kibibi was well known for her role as Siti in the famous Swahili series Tausi. She died in 2005. Hamberger said Ashina was her boss, best friend, big sister and mentor. The two were working on Kasheshe at the time of Ashina’s death. “By the time she passed on we had like around 30 episodes left and we were confused because here we were we have a production that we started together, it is in the middle of production, the content is there, some of it edited, some of it was unedited, so we had to let go,” Hamberger said. Ashiner Pictures has produced about 70 Swahili movies and series, including Sumu, Almasi, Cheche, Utandu, Udhalimu, Majaliwa and Lulu, among others. Hamberger, a producer, actress and media owner, aims to create more local content to provide jobs. “My main objective in this industry is to make sure we get as many local content creators as possible because you realise we have a lot of young talent and a lot of young guys who are coming out of school and do not know where to go,” she said. Hamberger said there is a lot of talent at the Coast that needs to be nurtured. “We have very good local talent which we should make sure that it is nurtured and that includes us who have been in the industry for all these years,” she said. Money is the greatest challenge when it comes to film production, Hamberger said, followed by piracy. Hemberger is also the CEO of Raia TV. Her co-director is Henry Lenga. The television station airs local content.
