A day after Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i toured some villages in Gatundu South over an upsurge of crimes; anonymous people dumped three bodies in the area. Villagers at Gachoka and Kimunyu villages woke up to a rude shock on Saturday morning after they found the three bodies of middle aged men dumped in the area. The visibly shaken villagers who spoke to journalists said that the three unidentified young men who were dumped 500 meters apart seemed to have been murdered elsewhere. “They all seemed to have been strangled with a wire. Blood was oozing from the mouth and nose. They were smartly dressed and we suspect they were murdered elsewhere before being dumped here,” said resident Joseph Kamau.
