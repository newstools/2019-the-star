Tharaka Nithi's Muslim community has appealed to the county government to include them in employment positions and education bursaries. They say that they are bona fide members of the region just like other religious groups. Chuka mosque assistant imam Sadat Shabaan said incorporating members of their community into the government can help the county grow economically. “Although we are a minority religious group, our professionals can give their input into the development agenda,” Imam said. Shabaan spoke during the Madrasa Tul  Hidaya Tul graduation held at Chuka Musque on Saturday. The imam claimed that professionals from their community are treated as outcasts in the county. He said the situation had forced their children to seek employment opportunities in other counties with bigger numbers of Muslims. “Nobody in this community has benefited from employment even after our children applied for the positions they are qualified,” lamented the Muslim cleric. He further claimed that the areas where they reside in are neglected; citing a lack of street lighting and poor roads. He said pleas to the area MP for street lighting in their suburb in Chuka town has always fallen on deaf ears, leaving them at the mercy of muggers. “The street lighting and tarmacking of Chuka town sidelined us and it makes it unsafe to move around including going to the mosque for prayers,” Shabaan said. The imam urged Muslims to stay united and continue practising their faith. He urged faithful to master the teachings of the Quran and Hadithi that guide them to avoid falling prey to immoral behaviour.
