Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga has said Garissa County Assembly will not pass Punguza Mizigo Initiative fronted by Thirdway Alliance Party leader Ekuru Aukot. Wanga on Saturday said the county is waiting for recommendations from the Building Bridges Initiative report. " Mambo ya Punguza Mizigo inazimwa hapa Garissa. Garissa wanasema wanaongoja ile report ya BBI," She said. (Anything to do with Punguza Mzigo will be failed here because Garissa is waiting for the recommendations by the BBI team). She spoke during an Embrace rally in Garissa which was attended by over thirty women, including Garissa Woman Rep Fatuma Gedi. Wanga used the platform to condemn National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale for what she termed as frequent verbal abuse to women. "The other day in Parliament Duale told me that I am not his wife. I want to tell him here at Garissa that I also have my husband and I am not looking for another one," she said. Wanga told Garissa residents that Duale who is also the sitting Garissa Town Member of Parliament has lost respect to their governor Ali Korane and women legislators. She said the country has experienced peace and unity since Handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. Public Service Chief Administrative Secretary Rachael Shebesh urged Garissa leaders to work together in order to channel government resources to the local youths and women. In August, Wanga urged county assemblies in Nyanza to reject the Punguza Mizigo Bill on their floors. She argued that the Punguza Mizigo Bill will lead to the scrapping of many constituencies and disadvantaged women in the country. The six counties are Kisii, Homa Bay, Kisumu, Nyamira, Siaya and Migori
