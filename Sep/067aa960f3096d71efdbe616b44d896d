Fishermen returning from the deep seas retrieved a body of a man which was floating near Nyali Bridge, Indian Ocean on Tuesday. The deceased was identified as Evans Wekesa, who worked with Texas security company as a guard. Davinson Wandera, his neighbour, said that Wekesa left home on Monday evening for a night shift and was fine at the time. “He greeted me as I was going to take a shower and I didn’t see him again until now,” he said. His colleague Justus Ouma said that Wekesa was dedicated to his work and had not shown any signs of stress, adding that he was a churchgoer and an elder. “Yesterday, he didn’t show up at work and all lines were off, so when we heard there was a body found near his house we came to check,” he said. The deceased had an injury on his left side, but the rest of his body was intact, according to Kombo Mrinzi, a Nyumba Kumi official who inspected it. County police commander Augustine Nthumbi confirmed the incident. While police are yet to establish the motive of the killing, several bodies have been retrieved near the bridge in the past in cases of suicide. His body was taken to Coast General Hospital Mortuary.
