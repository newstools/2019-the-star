Kenya's tourism sector is set to benefit from a major US travel agents association meeting that kicks off in Chicago today. Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) expects to use the two day-event (September 13-14) to lure more visitors from the US which is currently the leading market source. International arrivals from the US market grew 9.4 per cent in half year 2019 (January -June) compared to the same period last year. Total arrivals during the period clocked 110,668 compared to 101,167 in a similar period last year. The Association for the Promotion of Tourism to Africa (APTA) forum is the world’s largest meeting platform for travel agents. The forum brings together approximately 200 travel agents who are committed to selling destinations in Africa. KTB chief executive Betty Radier yesterday said the forum presents a great opportunity to market Kenya’s unique selling points and actively push the destination to a larger audience. “Through KTB, Kenya will be one of the lead participants at the national forum this year. This will help us increase our visibility as a destination," she said. She said for the Kenya to remain competitive there is need to profile its tourism in global forums, especially those that give  an opportunity to share top and signature products and promote destination Kenya. The tourism ministry, led by CS Najib Balala, has been banking on the direct Kenya Airways flights  to Newyork to bring in more traffic. AT the forum, KTB will be focusing on increasing the number of APTA members selling Kenya from the current 75 per cent to 90 per cent. Traditionally, travel agents drive business to Kenya and according to KTB, it is critical that they understand the unique selling propositions of Kenya so that they can sell the destination confidently.
