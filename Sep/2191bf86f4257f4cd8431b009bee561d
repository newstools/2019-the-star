An ex-senator has expressed fears that the revenue allocation stalemate might prompt the government to unilaterally allocate revenue to counties Former Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti said if the stalemate persists the government will have no alternative but to distribute funds to counties. The Senate and the National Assembly have been unable to resolve the revenue impasse. Senators want counties to receive Sh335 billion but the MPs propose Sh316 billion equitable revenue share. Kivuti said the scenario can be very detrimental to the counties as the projects that have been going on at the grassroots might stall. The former lawmaker blamed the MPs over the stalemate noting that they are the ones that have refused to allow the rightful amount to be given to the counties. He said if the deadlock continues the counties might shut down for lack of funds. “It’s very sad when we know about the progress we have made. All this money you see that has enabled tarmac to be everywhere is because of devolution,” he said. Kivuti spoke at St Johns’ Kianjuki Girls’ Secondary School in Embu East subcounty during a funds drive to build more classrooms. On Thursday last week Council of Governors chairman Wycliffe Oparanya warned that if the stalemate is not resolved by September 16, counties might shut down.
