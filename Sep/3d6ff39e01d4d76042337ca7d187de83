The Senate will hold a special grassroots session in Kitui from Monday to Friday. Speaker Ken Lusaka will lead all senators to Kitui for the second Senate Mashinani session at the Kitui county assembly. The first such session was held in Uasin Gishu county. Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua on Friday urged residents to uphold decency during the Senate sitting. “I appeal to you to handle our visitors with decorum and give each one of them a reason to want to come back to Kitui. National and international media will be broadcasting the Senate events from Kitui,” he said. The senator reminded residents that their behaviour will portray the image of Kitui county. “It is time to put our best foot forward and give a good account of ourselves. Let each one of us commit to make the best out of this historic visit," he said. Wambua at the same time asked Kitui residents to be strategic and tap into the business boom that will come with hosting of the Senate sitting. “The fortunes of Kitui Senate Mashinani sittings are already being experienced even before the sittings start on Monday, September 16,” the senator said in a statement. He noted that regardless of the political affiliations of different business people in Kitui, everyone  will benefit from the presence of senators in Kitui. “Churches, mosques and other places of worship will also register increased numbers,” he added.
