Police in Thika are investigating the death of an Administration Police officer that occurred at Africa Spirits Ltd on Saturday evening. Thika subcounty deputy police commander Bernard Ayoo said that APC Samuel Njogu tripped and fell from the stairs while manning the facility. He was rushed to Thika Level 5 Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Ayoo refuted claims that the officer was drunk while on duty. “We cannot ascertain the allegations that he was drunk. All we know is that he slipped and fell and was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital,” Ayoo said. The company, a licensed manufacturer of spirits including Glen Rock, Legend Black, and Blue Moon was raided by the state early this year following claims of tax evasion and smuggling of illicit ethanol. Detectives on January 31 seized 312,000 litres of ethanol with an estimated tax potential of Sh1.2 billion from the company. They also impounded 21 million fake excise duty stamps. Businessman Humphrey Kariuki was last month charged with tax evasion amounting to Sh41 billion by the company. The court, however, freed the tycoon on a Sh10 million cash bail with an alternative bond of Sh20 million. The case will be mentioned on September 5. (edited by O. Owino)
