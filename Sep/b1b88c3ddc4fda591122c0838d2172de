A precedent-setting assessment of Grade 3 learners started on Monday under the new Competency-Based Curriculum. The assessment, spearheaded by the Kenya National Examinations Council, will inform how well the learners can read, write and count after their first three years of primary education. Teachers are required to monitor the attitude and character of the 1.3 million learners. The CBC seeks to ensure that learners are competent in communication and collaboration, critical thinking and problem-solving, creativity and imagination, citizenship, digital literacy, ability to learn and self-efficacy. The assessment is different from the traditional question and answer format under the 8-4-4 system. The 2-6-6-3 curriculum is interactive and learners do not sit examinations until they reach Grade 9, the start of junior secondary school. The intention is to eliminate the traditional format of examination where learners are put under strict scrutiny and awarded marks per the number of questions they answer correctly. The test is divided into sections and learners will be awarded scores on the number of questions they get right in each section. The points awarded will be classified as below expectation, approaching expectation, meet expectation and exceed expectation. The highest award being four meaning the learners has exceeded expectation. The Grade 3 assessment has been narrowed down to Mathematics, English and character building. Under Maths, learners are assessed on counting and numbers, measurements, and geometry. In English, the learners are required to read a short story loudly. The teacher awards marks on the basis of how many words the learner is able to pronounce correctly. The teachers will also assess the learner on oral questions, and writing where the learner will be required to write a short composition. Character building is assessed on clean-up exercises in places like markets nearÂ  schools.
