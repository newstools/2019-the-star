A Homa Bay court has stopped the nomination process of a new bishop for the Anglican diocese of Southern Nyanza. The court issued an injunction restraining the church selection committee from conduction any interview. The panel had prepared to conduct interviews on September 31 for the successor of Bishop James Ochiel. The Southern Nyanza regional office is in Homa Bay town. Ochiel is expected to retire in December. Homa Bay senior principal magistrate Thomas Obutu temporary stopped the interview process after two applicants raised objection. Last Wednesday, George Kibogo and Salmon Owii moved to the court and sought an injunction on grounds that due process was not followed during the formation of the selection panel. They argued that the committee tasked to interview candidates will not be transparent. The panel is composed of seven members. Kibogo and Owii claimed that some people from the church headquarters in Nairobi were interfering with the process. “The application is hereby admitted and the committee is barred from conducting interviews until this court gives direction,” Obutu said. He set an interparties hearing on September 11.
