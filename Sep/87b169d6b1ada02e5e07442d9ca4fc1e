Farmers have been encouraged to utilise a new farming application that gives localised weather predictions. Fertiliser manufacturer Yara East Africa said the newly developed mobile app provides accurate and relevant weather information. The company's marketing manager, Vitalis Wafula, said the application predicts the weather in any given area, helping farmers make informed decisions. Wafula, who spoke at Sotik in Bomet during a farmers' open day, said this would also save farmers unnecessary losses. "With this application, once installed on the Android phone, one can plan for what to undertake at a particular season on their farms since they receive alerts of the locations they are in," he noted. The official said they will be conducting more sensitisation meetings across the country as they seek to educate farmers on the importance of the mobile tool. During the event, farmers also interacted with various farm care companies where they were educated on new farm products and farming technologies. Country manager for Yara East Africa, William Ngeno, recently said they have deployed agricultural extension officers to advise farmers on the best  practices. “We have extension officers who offer value-added support to our customers on the importance of soil nutrition and good farming practices for quality production of food and cash crops,” Ngeno said. The government also plans to increase the number of agricultural extension workers to help increase food output by enabling farmers to adopt good cultivation practices.
