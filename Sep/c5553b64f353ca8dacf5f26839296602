Richarlison scored twice as Everton beat Wolves 3-2 in an entertaining Premier League contest at Goodison Park. Wolves thought they had earned a point when Raul Jimenez bravely headed home in the 78th minute, but Richarlison showed his own aerial prowess two minutes later to rise above Willy Boly and give Everton all three points. The Brazilian had put Everton in front in the fifth minute after converting from 16 yards following defensive miscommunication between Conor Coady and Rui Patricio. Alex Iwobi scored his first Premier League goal for Everton, converting Gylfi Sigurdsson’s pin-point cross, after Romain Saiss had put Wolves level from close-range in a blistering opening 12 minutes. Boly capped his side’s disappointing day by being dismissed in the dying seconds after a receiving second booking for a foul on the impressive Richarlison. With only four Premier League games played, Everton climbed to fifth in the table, while Wolves remained in 17th and without a league win. Meanwhile, Celtic ended Rangers’ 12-game unbeaten run and moved three points clear at the top of the Scottish Premiership with victory in a frantic Old Firm contest. Neil Lennon’s side had lost their past two derbies at Ibrox, but a makeshift defence thwarted Rangers’ attempts to win for a third time in four meetings. Odsonne Edouard netted his fifth goal in seven games against Rangers just after the half-hour, then Jonny Hayes rolled in after a stoppage-time counter-attack before Jordan Jones was sent off for a lunge on Moritz Bauer. It was just a second defeat in 19 games for Steven Gerrard’s side and the first time in six Old Firm games that the home side have failed to win. For Celtic, it is a fifth consecutive league victory since their loss at Ibrox in May as they attempt to win a ninth title in a row.
