A woman yesterday was charged with assaulting her friend who had gone to her house to ask why she had beaten her child. Court documents indicated that on September 9, Mercy Naliaka assaulted Phyllis Kanyua by beating her after she visited her home to inquire why Mercy had beaten her daughter. She said her child was innocent. The alleged attack occurred on September 9 in Kibera Makina in Nairobi county. Kanyua reported that she got home to find that her child had been beaten and she wanted to find out why. “I visited her home to ask why she had beaten up my child occasioning her bodily harm, and immediately she landed on me with blows,” she told the police. Kanyua said the accused person colluded with her husband to ensure she did not disclose the reason for beating her child. “She had her husband’s support. Her husband kept stopping me from inquiring why she beat up my child,” Kayuna said. She said that neighbours came to her aid and they reported the matter to the police, leading to Naliaka's arrest. Appearing Kibera law courts senior principal magistrate, Naliaka denied the charges. Yesterday she asked the court for lenient bond terms. The magistrate granted her a bond of Sh30, 000 and a cash bail of Sh10,000. Boke directed the case be mentioned on September 30 so the accused can be supplied with witness statements and documentary evidence. The hearing was set for November 19. (Edited by V. Graham)
