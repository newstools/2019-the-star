A section of Sabaot elders from Mt Elgon constituency in Bungoma County has installed Baringo Senator Gideon Moi as a Kalenjin elder in readiness for the 2022 presidential elections. The elders said that Moi has what it takes to be the country’s fifth president. The ceremony was conducted privately. They said Moi now has all their blessings to become the country's fifth president. The leaders handed him the traditional hat that symbolises power and the spear that commands authority in the Kalenjin tribes. The installation also means the leader was ready to guide, protect and lead the community. The ceremony is usually accorded to only one person who will become a leader at a particular time. Speaking during the event, Moi applauded the move by the elders and said that leaders should focus on helping President Uhuru Kenyatta to achieve the big four agenda. He also said he supports the government in his fight against corruption, stating that more efforts should be put to curb the vice. The Baringo senator also called upon the government to solve the Mau forest issues amicably to avoid future clashes between Maasai’s and Kalenjins. His sentiments were echoed by former Bomet governor Isaac Rutto, who accompanied Moi during the event. Rutto said that the victims should be compensated to allow them to resettle. The event was also attended by former Mt Elgon MP John Serut. Mt Elgon MP Fred Kapondi snubbed the event, which happened as DP William Ruto was in Vihinga county to popularise his 2022 bid.
