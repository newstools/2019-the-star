Kirinyaga Jubilee Party officials have lashed out at elected leaders in the county for propagating politics of division and engaging in premature 2022 campaigns. County deputy organising secretary Nicholas Maina said that political wrangling in the region has affected service delivery to wananchi. Maina said coffee and tea sectors in the county have been affected by poor prices and it was a high time the leaders came together to find lasting solutions. The official further cautioned MCAs from sabotaging Governor Anne Waiguru’s projects and urged them to support her to deliver on her mandate. Maina spoke to the press in Sagana alongside the organising secretary Maina Kihia On his part, Kihia faulted leaders he did not name for undermining and attacking Interior PS Karanja Kibicho who hails from the region. The party official said Kibicho is a representative of President Uhuru Kenyatta and is serving the government in his capacity hence it is uncalled for to have leaders undermine him. “We have even seen some leaders attack PS Kibicho. We want to caution them against such acts,” he said. Kihia further called for the unity of the Mt Kenya region leaders and told Tanga tanga and Kieleweke groupings off saying they are hurting the region. He said the region is solidly behind President Uhuru and his deputy William Ruto. The Mount Kenya region will support DP Ruto’s presidential bid in 2022 since he supported Uhuru in 2013 and 2017 general elections, he said. (edited by O. Owino)
