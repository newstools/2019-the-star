The debate on why we should change the Constitution is cheap and laughable. Driven by the same politicians who should faithfully implement the document, the clamour coming on the heels of selective implementation of laws can only be seen in light of people who want to control public lives. There has been no fidelity to the law politicians want to change since it was promulgated in 2010. Yet it covers extensively the very issues politicians are now talking about. It provides stipulations that, if implemented, will solve most of our problems. And now politicians are rushing to point out what should be changed to suit their narrow agenda of clinching power. Politicians can do a much better job if they focus on how to safeguard peopleâ€™s liberty, economy and safety.  Economic and political analyst
