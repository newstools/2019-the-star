Nurses in Taita Taveta county want one of their own to vie for senator or govrnor. They are trying to persuade outgoing Kenya National Union of Nurses’ county secretary general Bonface Mrashui to run for office. Mrashui welcomed the call to join politics, promising to unveil his ambitions shortly. “Politics is all about ideology and support. If my colleagues give the required support then I will happily take up the new task. We have lacked somebody in the county leadership who can understand us better,” Mrashui said. KNUN Taita Taveta chairperson Halima Hassan said they are mobilising all health workers to rally behind the retired nurse. She was speaking in a Voi hotel during Mrashui's retirement party. He has served the union for almost two decades. Halima said a representative in the county would help end the push and pull between the union and government. “We are bidding farewell to Mrashui, but we need him more than ever. We want him to take on a new task. Being a  senator or a governor would be better for us,” the chairperson told the Star on Monday. Incoming secretary Reuben Matolo said Mrashui’s candidature in the next general election would be a game-changer for the union. “All nurses can attest that he is a great leader who worked selflessly to unite them and fight for their rights. We will support him to clinch a bigger position so that he can fight for us better,” Matolo said. The ex-boss successfully fought understaffing that was hurting services in major departments. “We have disagreed with Mrashui several times on nursing matters," county Health chief officer Christine Mwaker said. "Nevertheless, he helped the county identify shortfalls in the departments and we are focussing on offering the best services. Let us all emulate him." she said. Edited by R.Wamochie
