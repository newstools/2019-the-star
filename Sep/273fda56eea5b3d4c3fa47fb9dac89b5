A man considered to be a threat to women will remain in prison after the High Court upheld his 30-year jail term. Justice Farah Amin, sitting in Voi,  said the sentence imposed on Joseph Nasibu Amiri was justified in light of the risk he poses to women. Amiri was in 2017 convicted of grievously attacking Gladys Mwamburi Kakya on November 24, 2013, at Burandogo village in Taita Taveta. The delay in conviction arose after he disappeared until January 2017 when was arrested as he committed another offence. He had also threatened and intimidated prosecution witnesses. Kakya was his wife for four years.  She had told the court that she and the appellant had disagreed and she had left him and returned to her mother's home. On the material date, she had found him waiting for her armed with a panga. Her mother and sister were present. “He proceeded to slash me repeatedly as I screamed for help,” Kakya said. She was slashed on the head, hand, wrist and abdomen. “I held up my hands to protect myself and he severed four fingers.  I was hospitalised for several weeks. Part of my left hand was amputated,” she had testified. Her sister corroborated her evidence. Justice Amin said Amiri had shown no remorse for his actions. “In light of the risk he poses to women, the sentence is justified.  The appellant has shown no remorse for his actions,” he said.
