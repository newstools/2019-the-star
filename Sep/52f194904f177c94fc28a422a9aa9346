Kenya National Paralympic Committee (KNPC) has vowed to take disciplinary action against the leadership of the Kenya Para Volley Federation for mishandling players currently in Rwanda. KNPC president, Agnes Oluoch said the poor management of the para volley teams by the federation leaders has put them in the current precarious situation in Kigali. Addressing the media at the NSSF building, Oluoch said the sitting volleyball team did not get clearance or funding from the government to travel out of the country. The team used their own means to find transport and accommodation facilities in the Rwandese capital. "It was agreed, between the ministry of sports and the KPVF that they attend the qualifier championships in Morocco in January next year, as opposed to the one in Rwanda. They, however, opted to go against the proposal. This is unfortunate because they are now misrepresenting the country and should take responsibility of their own mess," she said. Oluoch alluded that being disabled does not give anyone a free gate pass after wrong-doing. She insisted that the para volley officials will be suspended. She ruled out lenience for this federation since this is a recurrent behavior from the officials. "We urge the sports registrar to suspend the current leaders in the Para Volley Federation and put in place a Â caretaker committee. "We should be accountable for our actions and we will not let this slide. The federation has always had issues and we believe by doing this, we may restore order," said Oluoch. Last Thursday, the Kenyan contingent in Rwanda were kicked out of their hotel rooms for non-payment.
