The state has until September 21 to supply defence lawyers in billionaire Humphrey Kariuki's tax evasion case with witness statements and other documentary evidence. Trial magistrate Martha Mutuku on Thursday said the defence ought to have been supplied the documents immediately Kariuki and his co-accused were arraigned last month. Her ruling followed an application by assistant DPP Vincent Monda for more time to issue all the documents. Monda said the documents are voluminous and include 10 boxes of invoices. “I urge the court to grant us 21 more days to enable us to supply witness statements and other documents to be used in the cases,” he said. Principal Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot, who is handling a separate file, issued a similar order. Defence lawyers Cecil Miller, Kioko Kilukumi and Benard Nzakya argued that they would only be ready for trial after the prosecution supplied them with evidence. "The witness statements and other documentary evidence held by the prosecution are fundamental to the accused and the defence lawyers in prosecution of the case," they said. Monda said some statements had been presented to the defence, but more documents were yet to be provided. The defence acknowledged they have 27 witness statements and 23 exhibits as of Wednesday. The matter will be mentioned on September 26 for confirmation of compliance. Kariuki and his co-directors at Africa Spirits Limited have denied Sh41 billion tax evasion charges. The alleged offences were committed between June 2016 and August 2018. Besides tax evasion, the accused face forgery and money laundering offences. Kariuki was last month granted Sh11 million bail or Sh22 million bond. Presiding magistrate Francis Andayi said at the time that it would be discriminatory to detain Kariuki, as sought by the prosecution when his co-accused had been freed on bail. His lawyers claimed that he had learned that he had been summoned from the media and then presented himself voluntarily in court.
