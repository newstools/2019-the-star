Kibera Black Stars coach Leonard Saleh wants his players to quickly adapt to his offensive style of play as the team looks to better last season’s 15th place finish. The former Bidco coach is yet to win a match at his new club. Kibera were beaten 1-0 by new boys Murang’a Seal in the season opener before a 1-1 drab draw with Modern Coast Rangers — a result which leaves them 14th on the log with just a point. Saleh, who also coached KCB, is keen to avoid last year’s debacle, where they went on a 13-game winless. He believes tomorrow’s match against St. Joseph’s Youth at Afraha Stadium, Nakuru is an ideal opportunity for his boys to show what they are made of despite a poor preseason. He said: “We are transitioning from a defence-minded team to an attacking one. We cannot continue with the defensive approach we had last season. We are attacking from the start, mindful of the defence so as to maintain the team’s balance. Players need to readjust to the new system.” “We had an awful preseason which we started two weeks prior to the new season because players had gone for trials elsewhere and returned late. However, we cannot delve much in to it. The team is getting better. The first match we had ideas. The subsequent one we scored our first goal, quite positive. Against St. Joseph’s we go for maximum points.” Saleh hopes to get his forwards firing upfront having scored only 38 goals last season. He also hopes to improve their away record.
