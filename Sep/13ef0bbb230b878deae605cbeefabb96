The lack of transfer action should not be misconstrued to mean lack of ambition from Kariobangi Sharks, assistant captain Patillah Omotto has reckoned. The midfielder was part of the squad that battled to a two-all draw against Western Stima on Friday. “Of course we were disappointed but we at least got a point and that is the most important thing. We wanted to win against Stima but being the first game, they were equally determined not to lose. We have another opportunity this weekend to get our first win,” he said. Sharks had twice taken the lead against new-look Stima but a late penalty converted by goalkeeper Samuel Abawa Odhiambo ensured they shared the spoils. “It was a tough game and I think overall, it was a fair result. It’s still early days but we know we have to get three points,” he said. Patillah, who wore the famous Rio Tinto AFC Leopards jersey in 2013 after shifting from Bandari, was disappointed for not being part of the Stars squad that is set to face off with Uganda this weekend. “Every coach has his own ideas on how he wants to play. The only thing you can do is to do your best in every situation in training or in games. That is the only way you can win the confidence of the coaches,” he added. Sharks are due to face off with Ingwe this weekend. Leopards fell to a last-minute defeat at the hands of Kakamega Homeboys and coach William Muluya was confident that they can heap more misery on the former champions. “ They are a team that always has huge ambitions. They lost the first game and they will be determined to get points on board. They had key players missing but they will be strong on Saturday,” said Kanu.
