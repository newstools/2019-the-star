The National Assembly has embarked on a process to fill in the vacancies at the National Land Commission. This is after Speaker Justin Muturi relayed President Uhuru Kenyatta’s message containing details of the nominees for approval. Muturi forwarded the names to the Lands committee ahead of vetting. The Speaker had earlier on said Uhuru’s nominees will be discussed when the House resumes sittings on Monday. He said the appointments will be debated and approved within 14 days of communicating the report to the House. Uhuru last month picked his ICC lawyer Gershom Otachi Omanwa as the nominee for the chairperson of the National Land Commission. Otachi was among the battery of lawyers who represented Uhuru during his ICC case at The Hague. The appointment ended the long wait at NLC which has been without commissioners since the exit of the Muhammad Swazuri-led team in February. Otachi is a lawyer and specialises in civil, land, criminal, matrimonial, and property matters. He has for the past four years been the chair of the Geothermal Development Company. Former Labour Cabinet Secretary Kazungu Kambi is among the eight other members whose names Uhuru has sent to Parliament for approval. Kambi has since April been the chairman of the Coast Development Authority.
