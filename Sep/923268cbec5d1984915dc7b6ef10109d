KRA officials on Thursday intercepted customs officials at the Lunga Lunga One-Stop Border Post (OSBP). They intercepted a consignment of 201 pieces of dried butterflies and 20 pieces of vulterine guinea fowl feathers. The restricted goods were nabbed from a suspect travelling from Tanga to Mombasa at Lungalunga border during routine scanning exercises, KRA said in a statement to newsrooms. The agency said the suspect was planning to export the goods to Hungary and UK. The suspect had a temporary passport and lacked the required permit from KWS. “The officials noticed the suspicious cargo, prompting them to verify contents of the shipment and later discovered the restricted items,” the statement read in part. He was also found to be in possession of a stamp with initials of the Director of Veterinary Services, Dar es Salaam. Documents showed that the dried butterflies consignee was in Szombathely, Hungary, while an invoice indicated that the consignor for the vulterine guinea fowl feathers was in Dar es Salaam. Guinea fowl and butterfly trophies are restricted goods under the East African Community Customs Management Act (EACCMA) second schedule.
