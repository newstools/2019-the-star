FORMER national champions Ulinzi Warriors are once again eyeing top spot in the Premier League. Speaking after beating United States International University 92-44 at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium, coach William Balozi believes the team will once again find their way to the top again after being stalled by the Military Games assignment. “We played well. I am happy with the performance and I am sure we will soon move back to the top again. Thunder have played more games than us and I am convinced we will overtake them,” said Balozi. James Mwangi tallied 15 points while David Wanjala and Joseph Khaemba recorded 13 each for Ulinzi. Ariel Ortega made 12 and Larry Shavanga had 11 for the Tigers. In the women’s ties, Liz Okumu scored 15 points and Faith Atieno made 11 as the University of Nairobi Dynamites continued their good run, beating Zetech University 50-47. “I am surprised at what these crop of young girls have managed to achieve within a short time. Now we can dream of a top-four finish,” beamed coach Juma Kent. Lucy Mbithe had 17 and Maryanne Wanjiku 11 for the losers, whose coach Maurice Obilo blamed the loss on change in the timing. USIU squeezed a narrow 46-45 win over Eagles Wings as Sharlete Sibweche scored 11. Sandra Ekasimba replied with a similar score for the losers. “After leading throughout the game we made some very crucial turnovers and our opponents capitalised on the situation. We also missed many free throws,” mourned the losers’ coach Evelyne Kedogo.
