Leaders in Central Kenya have been asked to end political feuds for the sake of development. The call came from Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina in reference to the Sunday confrontation between the Tangatanga and Kieleweke wings of Jubilee Party in Kiharu, Murang'a. The clash happened during a fund raiser for Gatui Catholic Church after area MP Ndindi Nyoro stormed the venue and said he would preside over the function attended by the Kieleweke affiliates led by nominated MP Maina Kamanda. The Tangatanga wing is allied to Deputy President William Ruto while Kieleweke is perceived to lean towards President Uhuru Kenyatta. Tangatanga supports Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. Wainaina, who spoke after commissioning the construction of Madaraka market road in Thika, said politicians should put a break to 2022 politics and concentrate on development projects. “We must pray as a region and repent for the occurrences that are dividing us along political lines. Only Central Kenya leaders are engaging in political squabbles. "We have three more years to go to the next General Election. Let’s concentrate on working for our people,” he said. The first time MP won the Thika seat as an independent candidate. He said it was unfortunate for politicians to turn churches into political battlegrounds. Wainaina urged the clergy to prohibit politics in churches. “It’s time we asked God to intervene and save us from the hole that some politicians are digging for us. All we want is unity for the sake of development,” he said.
