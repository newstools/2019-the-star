Distraught Budalangi and Funyula fishermen have appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to urge his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni to end persistent harassment by Ugandan security forces on Lake Victoria. Otherwise, diplomatic relations should be severed, they said. Speaking to the Star on Sunday, Marenga Beach Management Unit chairman Robert Anema said harassment has reached an alarming level. He said they are forced to go to Ringiti Island in Kisumu county to fish or buy fish. He blamed the leaders in Busia county and national government for failing to find a lasting solution to the fishermen’s problems,  saying the fishing sector that contributes to economic growth is nearing its deathbed. Anema said Ugandan security personnel are always armed with modern war equipment ready to chase the fishermen suspected to have trespassed into Uganda’s territorial waters. He called for an end to cordial relations between Kenya and Uganda "since it is of no benefit to the fishermen from Bunyala and Samia subcounties". “Uganda has failed to respect the spirit of East African partner states, so it's high time Kenya considered severing her relations with Uganda for persecuting our fishermen striving to earn their daily bread,” Anema said. He said the fishermen are usually forced to eat raw fish at gunpoint.i He also complained that the security forces normally pursue Kenyan fishermen up to Sumba Islandin Kenya. Edited by R.Wamochie
