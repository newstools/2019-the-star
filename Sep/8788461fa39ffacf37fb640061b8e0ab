A leadership row over a dispensary in Kilome constituency, Makueni county, has led to the collapse of the facility. Problems started after the Catholic Church threw out the management of Mbyani dispensary. When the Star visited the facility that was established by Italian donors in the 1980s, scattered old syringes, patients' documents and expired medicine littered the place. The once clean facility is surrounded by overgrown shrubs and weeds. Doors, windows, filing cabinets and beds have been vandalised. At one corner, stands a makeshift bed indicating some people may have found a home in the building. James Kyengo, 70, said the dispensary was built through collaboration between the local community and Italian donors brought by then Kilome MP Tony Ndilinge, now deceased. “I was the secretary of the committee that came up with the idea of building this dispensary and we lobbied other sub-locations around here to support the idea. In 1986 we made bricks and started its construction with the assistance of the Italians at a cost of Sh360,000. Upon its completion, the donor handed over the facility to the community through documents in our possession,” Kyengo said. Years later, the Catholic Church is said to have tried to change ownership of the hospital after throwing out the management committee. “Around 1998, the Catholic Church brought in some staff and requested only one room to operate from but they later started encroaching on the entire hospital. They became the main service providers and took over the facility,” Kyengo said. The community wants the county government to step in immediately and revive the facility. Makueni health chief officer Patrick Kibwana told the Star the department will look into the matter.
