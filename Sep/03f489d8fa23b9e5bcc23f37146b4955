Multimedia University students on Monday morning protested against reckless driving by motorists on Magadi Road that claimed a life of one of their own. Police were called to restore order after the students on Monday morning paralysed operations on the busy Magadi road. Accidents linked to student deaths at the university have hit headlines in the last five years with the students taking to the roads on at least two occasions. In 2016 the students blocked the roads to protest the killing of one of the students who perished in a road accident. The students were protesting the death of their colleague who was one of the four passengers killed in the Lang’ata Road carnage. That same year, a fourth-year student at the institution was knocked down by a construction vehicle at the campus compound and reportedly died while being rushed to hospital. Last year, Multimedia  University was thrown into mourning again after it lost a  student leader to a grisly road accident which took place along the Nairobi Southern Bypass. Ronald Kiprono Kirui also known as Yusuf was travelling from Nakuru to Rongai together with two others when their vehicle lost control and veered off the road killing the then students secretary general on the spot.
