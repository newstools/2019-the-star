Jomvu MP Badi Twalib had a hard time calming an angry crowd at Miritini Complex School after reports that two Tanzanian artists were to perform at Saturday’s Embrace rally at exorbitant rates. Word had gone around that Tanzanian crooner Mbosso, real name Mbwana Yusuf Kilungi, and Khadija Kopa, would perform at the Tononoka rally for Sh5 million. Residents said that was a waste of money considering that on Friday, Twalib used Sh5.3 million to pay for 245 youths from his constituency to undertake technical and vocational courses at the National Industrial Training Authority. Mbosso performed at the Tononoka rally but Khadija did not show up. Journalist Omar Shungu said Mbosso usually performs for not less than Sh1.5 million outside Tanzania. “He travels with a crew of at least five people including his bodyguard, DJ, manager and photographer who must be well accommodated at five star hotels,” Shungu said. Mbosso and his crew stayed at Bahari Beach Hotel. On Friday when asked about the matter, Twalib refused to be drawn into the Embrace rally saying he was better off serving his constituents. “I have used this Sh5.3 million shilling to uplift the lives of the first batch of 245 out of a target of 800 youth to undertake technical and vocation training courses with Nita. “That is what I want to speak about. Other things will be talked about later,” he said.
