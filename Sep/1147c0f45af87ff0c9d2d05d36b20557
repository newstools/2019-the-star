A youth group has asked the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) to reconsider how it pursues corporations that are not tax compliant, saying the current trend might lead to huge job losses. Vision 2030 Youth Entrepreneurs Association on Monday said differences of view or disputes between a tax authority and taxpayers on the correct amount of tax owed or the timing of payment are a normal feature of tax administration across the world. The association's chairman, Edward Githaiga, said KRA should therefore not take measures that threaten the existence of local companies even when it is cracking down on companies that have tax arrears. “Recent events clearly show that KRA must be part of the solution rather than the problem. KRA should try and negotiate with this companies rather than take stern action.When local Kenyan companies shrink and close, we young entrepreneurs suffer,” said Githaiga. In a statement, the association appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to implore on all stakeholders not to abandon the laid down mechanisms for resolution of tax disputes. Githaiga lamented that KRA appears to be keen to replace arbitration with criminal prosecution. “We also must enforce accountability for the tax man. They must be praised for every good action but must be held accountable when they do shoddy investigations and destroy people’s businesses,” he added. However, KRA has defended its action on several occasions, saying it has been opting for criminal prosecution when dialogue appears to be headed nowhere
