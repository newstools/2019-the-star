An article published by the Kenyan Bulletin claiming that Wiper Party has named Jackson Ngechu Makini, popularly known as ‘Prezzo’, as its flag bearer in the November 7 Kibra by-election is FALSE. The article adds that the announcement was made by Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka on September 10. The Wiper Party had announced that Makini would contest the Kibra MP seat on the party’s ticket without providing any context. Kalonzo later clarified that the Wiper Party had indeed received Mr. Makini as a member on September 10, but he intends to contest the Kibra parliamentary seat in 2022 and not in the November 7 by-elections scheduled for November 7 as reported by a section of the media. The Kibra MP seat, which fell vacant following the July 26 death of Ken Okoth, has attracted a number of candidates from various parties. PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Wiper Party has named musician Jackson Makini as its flag bearer in the upcoming Kibra by-elections and finds it to be FALSE.
