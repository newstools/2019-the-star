In a bid to end the 14-year-long wait for a gold medal in 5,000m at the World Championships stage, former champion Benjamin Limo wants Athletics Kenya to go back to the drawing board in as far as the future of the distance is concerned. Limo is the last Kenyan to win the race during the 2005 edition held in Helsinki, Finland. Limo believes athletes within the 18-20 years bracket are better placed to tame the worrying retrogress the country has slumped to if properly guided. He tipped the athletes who have represented the country in the past world junior events to form a formidable team in the near future. “We could build a very good team from junior events. AK should be pro-active in selecting a team and not just to wait for the national trials. Olympic Games are set for next and preparations should start now,” he said. Meanwhile, the 2002 Commonwealth silver medallist fumed at the decision by AK to front two athletes in the race for the forthcoming championships set for Doha Qatar. The decision was arrived at after Michael Kibet and Daniel Simiyu who took the top two places during the trials failed to meet the Athletics Integrity Unit threshold. Kenya will be represented by the reigning Africa Cross-country junior champion Nicholas Kimeli and Jacob Krop. He faulted the federation for their last-minute and rushed preparations for the championships. “It is very disappointing as a country, which is deemed as an athletics powerhouse, to present only two athletes at the global show yet we have talent.” Much as he wished Kimeli and Krop good luck at the championships, he noted that the two lack the experience to compete at that level. They should have gone for athletes who have been competing at the Diamond Leagues. For Kenya to win at the global show we need team-work.”
