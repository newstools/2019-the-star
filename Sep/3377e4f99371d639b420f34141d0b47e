National athletics head coach Julius Kirwa expects sprint and field event athletes to qualify for the World Championships during the two-day trials which start at Nyayo Stadium today. 2015 world javelin champion Julius Yego and 400m trio of Alphas Kishoyian, Hellen Syombua and Mary Moraa are the notable athletes to have hit the respective qualifying standards. "This is the last chance for our athletes to hit the qualifying standards and we are hopeful that the likes of Gladys Nthenya, Millicent Ndoro and Linda Kahega will make the team," said Kirwa. However, Kirwa observed that Moraa has been unwell since returning from the All Africa Games, where she finished fourth last month. AAG silver medalist Alexander Kiprotich will be hoping to join Yego in the plane to Doha but will have to add a mammoth 6m to his 77m personal best. Ferdinand Omanyala is a top billing to qualify in the 100m where he needs to shed at least 0.10 seconds from his best time of 10.14 as Ndoro is a hopeful in the women's 200m. The latter will have to drop her best time of 23.48 by 0.46 seconds to secure a slot in the Doha team. Ndoro comes up against Rio Olympics 800m bronze medalist Margret Nyairera who has dropped to 200m race. In the field events, Maximila Imali has her work cut out as she chases the qualifying distance of 6.72m. Her current best time is 6.43m. Others who are hopeful of making the team, going by their proximity to the respective qualifying standards, are Isaac Kirwa in men's long jump, Bethwell Lagat in the triple jump and high jump's Matthew Sawe, who is only 0.05m shy of the qualifying height.
