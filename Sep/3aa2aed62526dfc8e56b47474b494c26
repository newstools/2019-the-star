 A Mombasa MCA has decried the rise in homosexuality in the region and called on the county government to put in place severe punishment for offenders. She said homosexuals were finding Mombasa a haven because residents are accommodating. “It is now becoming dangerous to children and the values we hold dear as a society,” Nominated MCA Fatma Kushe told the Star on the phone on Sunday. She said the trend must quickly be reversed or Mombasa may attract a big punishment from God. She said most of the homosexuals in the coastal city had migrated from Nairobi. “I don’t know why they are escaping Nairobi where they do not hide anymore. In Mombasa, you could not find two people of the same sex kissing in public but you can now easily spot them,” she said.
