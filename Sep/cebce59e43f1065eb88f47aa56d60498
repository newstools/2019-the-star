Wendy Waeni's ex-manager Joe Mwangi has been released on a Sh100,000 cash bail with an alternative bail of Sh200,000. Mwangi had been charged with forging a letter from Interior CS Fred Matiang'i on August 13 and sending it to the complainant Magdalene Syombua who is Wendy's mother. He denied the charges before Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi at a Milimani court. Mwangi was arrested by DCI detectives last Monday. Detectives based at Child Protection Unit started probing the matter last month after Wendy appeared on Citizen TV citing exploitation by Mwangi. Wendy, an acrobat, caught the attention of the public after revealing that Mwangi, her ex-manager, was swindling her from shows she has been performing both locally and internationally. After the media highlighted Wendy's issue, Mwangi came out claiming that she was spreading falsehoods and disparaging his character. He denied claims that he had been travelling with Wendy during world tours. Mwangi claimed there are interested parties who are out to malign him.
