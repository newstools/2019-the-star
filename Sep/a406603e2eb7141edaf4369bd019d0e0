A section of Coast leaders has promised to support Deputy President William Ruto's 2022 bid for the presidency. Led by Coast Development Authority director Mshenga Rugha, the leaders said Kwale has more than five groups ready to campaign for the DP. The politicians made the remarks at Godo in Lunga Lunga subcounty when they accompanied Ruto on his tour of the Coast. Rugha said residents voted for the Jubilee government because of Ruto. “Your Excellency, we went for Jubilee Party because we saw the light in you and whatever you agreed on in 2013,” he said. He criticised politicians who talk ill of Ruto calling them hypocrites. “How can you abuse Ruto and praise the President? Can't you see the irony in that?” he said. He urged Ruto to hasten efforts of empowering women at the Coast saying they will contribute to him succeeding president Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022. Inua Mama Team leader, Mariam Mbindo assured Ruto that Kwale women will stand by him when he declares his candidature. Mbindo said Kwale residents oppose the Building Bridges Initiative and want agenda that will raise the status of the Coast region. “Let BBI campaign in Mombasa and play the drums there but here we need development. We can't be changing the Constitution throughout our lives,” Mbindo said. Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa backed both the DP Lunga Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani saying they had done excellent jobs in transforming the lives of wananchi. Mwashetani is believed to be eyeing the Kwale governor's seat in 2022. Jumwa said the road to success is long and hard but urged locals to prepare for the best. (edited by O. Owino)
