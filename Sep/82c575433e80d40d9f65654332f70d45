Nakuru will host the Victoria Cup clash between Kenya and Zimbabwe in a fortnight. According to a statement by the Kenya Rugby Union, this is part of Kenya Rugby  Union 'strategic plan to decentralize the sport and ensure it is played at the grassroots. This will be the second time this year the test match will be played outside Nairobi. In June this year, Kisumu hosted the Elgon Cup first leg clash between Kenya and Uganda. Officiating and coaching clinics will be held in the run-up to the game against Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe are unbeaten in this year's  Victoria Cup and top the standings with 17 points. Kenya are second on 16 points. Zimbabwe host Zambia this weekend and could win the tournament if they beat their neighbours. Uganda Cranes who have completed their Victoria Cup fixtures sit third with 15 points while Zambia are fourth with zero points as they are yet to register any win or draw. The Kenya Simbas will resume training this week and coach Paul Odera expects a competitive contest. He will be hoping to reverse the 30-29 loss suffered in Bulawayo in August. Odera, who fielded a youthful side in the 31-16 win over Zambia in the same competition, will bring back his big guns for the clash against the Sables. “It's our last game of the year and we want to bounce back after losing the first leg game. We have a few areas to address but I am glad the team is improving with every game and we are relishing the challenge,” added Odera. Elsewhere, the Impala Floodlight tournament will kick off on September 28 and run until October 12. Impala chairman Bob Asiyo said invitations have been sent out to clubs with the draw expected to be done in a fortnight. KCB are the defending champions in the club category.
