Kenya Forest Service (KFS) men’s volleyball team are ready to return to the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) national league next season after being disbanded in 2014 due to financial constraints. The team,  previously known as Forest Rangers, will now compete under the name  KFS after new management, under the new director-general Julius Kamau took charge of the outfit. Team coach Wachira Gatuiria confirmed the new development, saying they will come back next season a better outfit than they left. Gatuiria said they used the just ended Laikipia County Open tournament  to gauge themselves ahead of the new season. The official said: “We are extremely delighted about our scheduled return to the league and that’s why we have begun our preparation in earnest. We took part in the Laikipia tournament and our performance was not bad and we want to build on it going forward. We are indebted to the new management for the support and our hope is to return the favour by performing well in the league.” He said despite losing a few players to other teams, those who remained are raring to go. He said: "We intend to recruit at least five  new players from clubs in the league to strengthen the outfit well ahead of time.” The team finished third in 2013 league and they will be hoping to replicate the same performance next season. KSF lost David Thuita and Julius Lelei to Kenya Ports Authority while Peterson Kimani joined the now disbanded Nairobi Water.
