The latest model of Isuzu m-Mux worth Sh6.4 million is at stake for the first golfer who delivers a hole-in-one during this Saturday’s Ruiru Isuzu EA Golf Tourney. The designated hole for the lucrative prize is the par 3 third hole, according to officials. Ruiru captain Peter Mwaura remarked: “The car is a huge motivation to the growing field of golfers and this is one of the best golf tournaments we have staged in Ruiru as we seek to take the golfing experience at the club to another level.” Mwaura added that the event will give golf enthusiasts another chance to prove their mettle on the tees and greens. The new-look Isuzu car is a stand out performer on and off-road with the legendary Isuzu 3-litre turbo diesel engine, a beefed up 430Nm of torque and an intuitive 6-speed transmission. Over 250 golfers are expected at the par 72 course and will be praying that lady luck smiles on them at the hole no 3  to win the Sh6.4 million car. Some of the players expected to put up a strong fight are recent winners Ben Kanyi, Tabitha Kiragu and the club’s vice-chairman Ben Ndungu, who posted impressive score last weekend during the Oxygen Communications and Marketing Golf Day. Others include Kinyua Muchiri, Stephen Mwitari and Jane Kanari. Golfers from clubs across the country have been drawn for the tournament which is part of Isuzu’s golf series. Leading local car assembler Isuzu EA heads to Ruiru sports Club for a tournament that promises intense golf action.
