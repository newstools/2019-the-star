A Nakuru MCA wants the county government to ensure equality in education for all children living with autism. Lakeview ward rep Peter Karanja has tabled a motion in the assembly to ensure the county establishes classrooms for special needs children and provide diagnosis systems for autism. The motion also calls for the training of teachers to handle such cases in ECDE centres. Gilgil town MCA Jane Ngugi has seconded the motion. The motion also proposes that a referral facility for autism cases be set up and a  committee to ensure compliance. Karanja said many children with autism have been neglected and others treated to stigma. “As we focus on ECDE centres, children with special needs should also be catered for and this motion will ensure the county takes responsibility. “If the motion sails through then it will help address challenges and gaps,” he said. Nakuru county is the seventh to have such a motion according to Autism Lights Incorporation director Maratu Chege. Chege said his organisation has commenced advocacy on autism because autistic children have been left out of many spheres of the society. The organisation has also trained teachers on how to handle autistic children. According to the World Health Organization, one out of 40 people is autistic hence interventions need to be put in place. Pediatric neurologists say that autistic spectrum disorder is a condition that stunts the development of the brain among children. In most cases, it leads to high energy levels (hyperactivity) and poor social interaction among victims.
