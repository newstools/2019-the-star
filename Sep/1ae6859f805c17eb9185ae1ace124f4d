Boda boda riders from Ruambwa sublocation have said the Bunyala North ward development committee ignored their views on the location of a motorbike parking shed. The riders told the Star they had proposed that the parking shed be constructed at Ruambwa-Mudembi junction but it was built at Ruambwa trading centre. But an official of the ward development committee rubbished the claims saying it is the riders themselves who proposed the Ruambwa trading centre location. He said the decision had been made at a public participation forum held at Mudembi trading centre. “The motorbike riders proposed that the parking shed be built at the site, so I fail to understand why they have refused to use the parking shed,” the official said. The committee had set aside Sh1 million for the construction of motorbike and bicycle parking sheds at Manyasi, Ruambwa, Sisenye and Mudere. Each boda boda shed was to cost Sh250,000. The riders have snubbed the Ruambwa trading centre parking shed since its construction two years ago by the  Busia county government. “This project was done by the taxpayers’ money. The county government has been losing a lot of money in terms of revenue,” the motorbike riders said. The unused shed has since been occupied by a cobbler and the riders say it should be demolished and relocated elsewhere. (edited by O. Owino)
