Senate Majority Leader and Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen had to be taken to hospital on Monday after sustaining an injury during a football match between senators and Kitui MCAs. The senator was picked by an ambulance and taken to Neema Hospital for treatment. He was discharged later in the evening. The senators and MCAs were playing at Kitui showground when an opponent tackled him roughly, injuring him. The Senate , dubbed Bunge Team, beat the MCAs 3-2. Senators are in Kitui for a week for plenary and committee sittings that will take place within the Kitui county assembly. This is part of the 'Senate Mashinani' initiative. Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka and Kitui speaker George Ndoto led their assemblies' leadership in a consultative meeting focused on the weekâ€™s programme.
