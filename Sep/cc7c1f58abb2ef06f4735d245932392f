The late iconic pop star, Whitney Houston, is to tour UK as a hologram in 2020. This is all thanks to Base Entertainment which has been working on its development for years. Base Entertainment is a live entertainment company in the US that develops, produces and presents live entertainment. Seth Faber, SVP of marketing at music publishing company Primary Wave, told Music Week that it will be an incredible show since so much effort has been put to make the show as authentic as possible. He said it's going to be a phenomenal experience. The New York Times previously reported that Houston's Hologram would perform hit songs like 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)' and 'The Greatest Love of All.' The songs will be backed up by her brother Gary and original backup singers.
