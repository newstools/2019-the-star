The Kenya Airports Authority board has appointed Alex Gitari as the acting managing director, following the exit of Jony Andersen. Gitari is KAA's general manager for finance. In a statement on Monday, board chairman Isaac Awuondo said Andersen had proceeded on leave, with his contract set to end on November 21. "I take this opportunity to thank Jony for his contribution during his tenure as CEO," Awuondo said. The recruitment process for a new MD begins on Tuesday. Andersen had worked for KAA since 2016. The announcement of Andersen's exit in August came days after Kenya Airways reported a Sh8.6 billion loss for the six months to June 30. The net loss more than doubled compared to the Sh4billion loss reported in a similar period last year. The airline's CEO Sebastian Mikosz, announced his exit in May this year on “personal grounds” with his last day in office set for December 31, five months before the end of his three-year contract. He was appointed CEO in May 2017, taking over from former CEO Mbuvi Ngunze with his more than 20 years experience in executive management in both the public and private sector being counted on to help KQ recover.
