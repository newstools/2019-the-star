ODM party has accused its National Super Alliance (NASA) affiliate parties of 'betrayal' following their decisions to front candidates for the Kibra by-election. Party Secretary General Edwin Sifuna said the move to sponsor candidates was detrimental for the survival of NASA. ANC has fronted Eliud Owalo while Ford Kenya has nominated Khamisi Butichi as its flag bearer for the November 7 by-election. Sifuna claimed the affiliate parties of NASA have for a long time betrayed the course taken by ODM. He noted that the Kibra by-election will be the launching pad for the end times of NASA. The party leaders of the affiliate parties, Sifuna said, have not been keen to walk with ODM party leader Raila Odinga in his political pursuit. He spoke in Nyando, Kisumu county during the burial of the area MP Jared Okello’s brother. Sifuna said Kibra over the years has remained the bedrock of ODM and it was not wise for Ford Kenya and Amani National Congress to field candidates. “For those who have decided to use Kibra mini-poll to divorce ODM party should know that it will be the straw that will break the camel's back. They’re stabbing us in the back,” he said. Sifuna said that moving forward there will be no political holy-grounds for ODM in the coming subsequent elections. “We will have candidates in all the political seats across the country,” he added He told Ford Kenya Party Leader Moses Wetang'ula to prepare to face an ODM candidate in the Bungoma Senatorial race in 2022 should he defend his seat. The SG announced that they will sponsor a candidate for the senate seat because they have declared war against the ODM. He said ODM party was ready to divorce NASA affiliated parties should they fail to tore the line noting that they are being dishonest. “If you asked for divorce then we will give you,” Sifuna added. The secretary-general accused some of the party leaders of opposing the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila.
