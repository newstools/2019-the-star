A court in Rwanda has sentenced a Kenyan man to two years in jail for conning young Rwandans into paying a registration fee for a wealth conference that never happened. Thousands of young people showed up in the capital, Kigali, for the conference, organised by Charles Kinuthia, at the Kigali Convention Centre on 25 June. Some told the BBC they had paid a $5 (Â£4) online registration fee - and had been promised $197 if they attended. Kinuthia's lawyer, Evode Kayitana, told the BBC that the sentence was unfair as the conference would have gone ahead had the police not intervened because of a security risk. He said officers stopped the event because the venue became overwhelmed by delegates who had misunderstood that the $197 was not a cash bonus for them to take home but represented the value of the day's training. Three of Kinuthia's employees - two Kenyan women and a Rwandan man - were acquitted by the court in Kigali. Kayitana said his client was going to approach the Kenyan government to see if it could intervene in the case.
