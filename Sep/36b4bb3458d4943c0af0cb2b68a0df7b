Debutants University of Nairobi Dynamites are eyeing their best finish in the Premier League, according to coach Juma Kent. The tactician praised his charges for a dream season and said he will fight tooth and nail not to lose any of the five games left on schedule. “What these girls have done in one year is unbelievable. Coming from a lower division to closing in on a top-five finish is quite superb. We have two matches this weekend and if we bag maximum points then our chances will be brighter,” he noted. UoN dimmed Strathmore University Swords 49-44 in a closely fought duel over the weekend in a match which lifted the team’s spirits. Kent said their remaining matches are against Storms, Eagles Wings, United States International University, Africa Nazarene and Western Delight.  “Our only away match in the fixture is in Kakamega against Delight. The other matches are in Nairobi and this gives us a good chance,” he observed. His dilemma, however, remains in the playing unit. He said he has been revolving only eight players— a move he described as risky. He said Ruth Obwagi is injured, Purity Wachira is having exams while Dottie Egesa is also committed and this has forced him to use fewer players. “I am afraid that fatigue will set in at some point but what worries me more are injuries,” he says. He said he needs post players to bolster the squad during the playoffs because of fatigue. “Back up will be important if the team was to progress,” he added. Flying the UoN flag high are captain Trizah Akeyo, Liz Okumu, Valery Kemunto, Kavata Mutisya, Faith Atieno and Shalom Gacheri. “We are in for a top-four finish. It is now a reality. But we will have to keep pushing now that we have finished out tough games,” he beamed.
