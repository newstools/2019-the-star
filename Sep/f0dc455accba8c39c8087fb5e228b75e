 Garissa is developing a giraffe strategic action plan to curb the declining number of giraffes in the county. A team, including officials from the county's department of tourism, the Ministry of Tourism, Kenya Wildlife Service and stakeholders has been formed to spearhead the task. Tourism executive Adow Jubat said the plan will also address poaching and boost community sensitisation to improve the numbers. The county said the number of reticulated and hirola giraffe species, only found in parts of Garissa, have been declining over the years. The Hirola species is found in Ijara while the reticulated species is spread throughout the county. Jubat said there were thousands of hirolas in the 1970s, the number had dropped to about 500. There are only about 15,000 reticulated species, down from 36,000 recorded in the 1980s. Speaking after touring the Garissa giraffe sanctuary on Saturday, Jubat said the cunty would do everything possible to protect giraffes. He was with KWS officials led by assistant director in charge of lower eastern Michael Wanjau. “These are animals you will not find anywhere else in the world. They are rare species. A combination of factors have led to their significant decline and that is what we want to address going forward,” Jubat said. He said the county was also engaging the community to create awareness on the importance of protecting animals. Increased poaching within the rangeland, climate change and drought have been blamed for the declining numbers. Jubat said the county was also engaging the national government to see how to mitigate the effects expected from the disruption to be caused by the Lapset project that will pass through the conservancy. Wanjau said there was need for stakeholders to work closely to ensure wildlife are protected.  edited by peter obuya
