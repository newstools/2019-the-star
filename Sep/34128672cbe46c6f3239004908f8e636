Six former and serving Tana River officials have been cleared of Sh30 million tender graft charges. Tana River chief magistrate Julie Oseko on Thursday freed them, citing poor investigations. Oseko had earlier put them and the companyÂ that was awarded the tender on their defence. Former county secretary Abdu Godana Dae and his co-accused are said to have approved the procurement of 100 collapsible tanks through a process not factored in the budget on October 7, 2016. The other suspects were Thomas Chula, Jeremiah Kidowe, Mwameso Juma, Abbas Bute, Abashora Swaleh Salad, Abdulle Mustafa Abdurahman, Khallaf Ayan Mohamud and Regional Drilling and Trading Company. Other charges were uttering a false tender document to win letter of award of tender by the KSL purporting it to be genuine and falsifying the same for the Bomet Agricultural Training Centre.
