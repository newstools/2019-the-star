Nyahururu Water and Sanitation Company managing director will serve a one-month suspension as an investigation over allegation of abuse of office proceeds. The water company board of directors on Wednesday resolved to send Bernard Mwaura on one-month compulsory leave. The MD is accused of bribing MCAs to shoot down the Laikipia County Water Services Management Bill, 2018. The Bill proposed a framework for the management of water resources, water harvesting, and provision of water and sewerage services in the county. “It is alleged that I bribed the MCAs to drop the Water Bill, but I want to make it clear to you that I don't have money for bribes,” Mwaura said yesterday. Mwaura said that there were individuals who had tried to interfere with the positive results achieved by the company which he has led for five years. “There were two meetings held by the directors to discuss unfounded allegations of how I interfered with the Water Bill. My conscience is clear and I believe that I will resume office after one month,” he added. Earlier, residents of Nyahururu had taken to the streets accusing the county government of playing politics with the management of the company. They alleged that Governor Ndiritu Muriithi and some MCAs had plotted the removal of the MD. Residents alleged that the Sh180 million grant to the company that serves over 75,000 residents of Laikipia West was the target by his rivals. The angry residents also noted that water executive Njenga Kahiro had remained silent on the issue. They accused him of scheming with the governor and his team to kick the MD out of office in order to fill the position with the 'governor's favourite'. “The governor no longer listens to us and puts his interests first," Munyiri Mutitu, a resident, said. The MD asked the residents who had camped outside his office to remain clam as due process is followed. Mwaura said that he had agreed with the board members to go on compulsory leave. (edited by O.
