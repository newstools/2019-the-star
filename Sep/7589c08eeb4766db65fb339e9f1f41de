Busia ODM MCAs have suspended majority leader Laban Mukhwana and chief whip Eric Kaibe for one week for allegedly failing to articulate party issues. The resolution was reached by 19 MCAs out of 27 under the chairmanship of county party boss Patrick Obongoya during a meeting in Kisumu. Chief whip Kaibe attended the meeting but Mukhwana sent apologies. Mukhwana on Friday told the Star on the phone that the purported decision to suspend him is null and void since it was not on the agenda of the meeting. “The purpose of the meeting was housekeeping and other party matters. I can step aside if members are dissatisfied with my representation but not through personal vendetta,” he said. Mukhwana said he will convene a meeting soon to find out when the party problems began. We have many county matters which need the attention of members instead of focusing on trivial issues, he said. Kaibe said his purported removal was an exercise in futility noting that there is no provision in the standing orders for the removal of a chief whip. “I am appointed by the party to handle party affairs in the assembly. If anything, it’s my duty to communicate to the Speaker on any decision of the members,” he said. He said that those who think he can be removed through unofficial sittings should consult the party headquarters. The MCAs present included Ekesa Kassaman, Grace Omasete, Vincent Olumbe, Maurine Wawire, Simon Asoka, Patrick Obongoya, Christine Owuor and Atieno Ologi. Others were John Obwogo, Margret Awino, Zainab Muyoti, Immaculate Adhiambo, Hawa Lemoil, Mwalimu Linus Asiba, David Kokonya, John Oganga and Novena Ndaliro.
