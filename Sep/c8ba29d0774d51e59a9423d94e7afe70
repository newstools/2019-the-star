Once again Kenyans will be waiting for the 'surprise' from Malkia Strikers as they face Korea this morning in the third final round of the FIVB World Cup in Osaka, Japan. The match is scheduled to start at 5 am. Korea, however, start favourites having won four matches and lost a similar number. The Asians are currently placed seventh out of the 12 participating nations. On the other hand, Kenyans who recorded two wins against Algeria and Peru in the 2015 edition, are yet to win a match or even a set in the eight matches they have so far played and the odds are against them. Kenya are pegged last on the standing win-less. Teams coach Paul Bitok acknowledged they are going through tough times but remained hopeful they will be better than their first two rounds in Hamamatsu and Sapporo cities. “It's not easy considering the opponents we are facing but we are hopeful we will be better. We are embracing new playing system and we just have to be patient. But the bottom line is that our opponents are playing better than us,” noted Bitok. Kenya face Russia tomorrow before they wrap up the two-week round-robin event against their newfound nemesis and much improved Cameroon on Sunday, where  Africa bragging rights will take centre stage. Today, Cameroon have a date with Brazil before battling the United States of America tomorrow. Kenya lost to the two teams and we will have to wait and see how Cameroon will fair against them. Cameroon are buoyed by the two sets they picked against Argentina and the Dominican Republic and boast of two points so far in the event despite making a debut.
