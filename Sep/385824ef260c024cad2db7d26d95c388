Virgil Van Dijk insists Liverpool need to keep winning despite the ‘big achievement’ of 13 straight Premier League wins, including last season. The Reds saw off Burnley 3-0 on Saturday, courtesy of a Chris Wood own goal, and strikes from Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino. It was also Liverpool’s first clean sheet of the season, and Van Dijk was satisfied with the performance and the result at Turf Moor. Van Dijk said: “It’s a big achievement winning 13 straight games but we have nothing yet. We have a break now but we want to keep going and win even more. With the quality we have in the team overall, on the bench as well, everyone knows how good we can be. The focus is on the next game now. Burnley away is always difficult for any team. It’s a good result.” “Burnley is a different challenge. We trained this week exactly how they would play and luckily I train against Origi which helps for this challenge. We know when there’s a long ball you have to try and win the second ball and for the opening goal that’s what we did, we attacked really quickly.” UEFA Player of the Year Van Dijk also praised the midfield trio of Jordan Henderson, Georginio Wijnaldum and Fabinho in front of him, particularly the Brazilian signed from Monaco last summer. “Fabinho is like inspector gadget,” Van Dijk joked. “He’s everywhere, his legs are everywhere. The long ball challenges, as centre-backs we wanted to go for that today, we didn’t want our midfielders going for it. The three midfielders we wanted to win the second ball and then start to attack. When they whip it into the channels we need our midfielders there. We prepared really well.” “If you look at the goals we’ve conceded so far we should’ve done better but it’s nothing to do with us pushing up more deliberately.”
