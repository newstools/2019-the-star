Senior Principal Magistrate Bernard Ochoi on Tuesday directed Joe Mwangi be detained for five days pending investigations in his forgery charge case. Police had earlier sought to detain embattled child star Wendy Waeni's manager for seven days on allegations of forgery. Mwangi allegedly forged a letter purporting to be a letter from Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and sent it to the complainant Magdalene Syombua - Wendy's mother - so as to intimidate her. The ex-manager was arrested by DCI detectives on Monday. Detectives based at Child Protection Unit started probing the matter last month after Wendy appeared on Citizen TV citing exploitation by Mwangi. Police said on Friday that Joe allegedly forged the letter threatening Mbele, of "some consequences". Waeni, an acrobat, caught the attention of the public after revealing that Mwangi, her ex-manager, was swindling her from shows she has been performing both locally and internationally. After the media highlighted Wendy's issue, Mwangi came out claiming that she was spreading falsehoods and disparaging his character. He denied claims that he had been travelling with Wendy during world tours. Mwangi claimed there are interested parties who are out to malign him. The office of the Director of Criminal Investigations stepped in after KOT demanded action over Mwangi's alleged exploitation of Wendy.
