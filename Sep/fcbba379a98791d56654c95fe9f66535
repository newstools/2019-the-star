Harambee Stars maintained position 107 in the latest Fifa rankings released yesterday. Stars, who played Uganda to a one-all draw in the past international week, failed to enrich their tally on the rankings despite Uganda being ranked 27 places above them. Prior to the Uganda friendly, Kenya had played Tanzania in a 2020 Chan qualifier. The first leg played in Dar-es-salaam ended in a barren draw with Tanzania claiming a 4-1 post-match penalties win in the second leg. Stars are currently gearing towards the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers set to begin in November, where they are placed in Pool G. Francis Kimanziâ€™s charges are lined to come up against record African champions Egypt who are perched 49th, Togo (124) and Comoros (147). Harambee Stars are scheduled to usher in the qualifiers with two friendly matches against Libya (102) and Mozambique (112). Uganda topped the Cecafa region in 80th position while Tanzania are 135. Rwanda and Burundi occupy positions 130 and 144 respectively. The 2019 African Cup of Nations (Afcon) beaten finalists Senegal remained the top-ranked team in the continent, maintaining their 20th position while Tunisia came second, nine places below Senegal. Nigeria are 34th while African champions Algeria are 38th. The surprise package in the past Afcon edition Madagascar are 95. Belgium top the chart with reigning global champions France breathing behind their backs. Five-time champions Brazil, England and European champions Portugal complete the top five.
