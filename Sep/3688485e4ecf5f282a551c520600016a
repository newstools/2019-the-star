Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge has received Athletics Kenya blessings ahead of next month’s INEOS 1:59 Challenge to be run in Vienna, Austria. The marathon record holder will be challenging his world record that stands at 2:01.39 set last year during the Berlin Marathon as he tries to break the sub-two hours barrier at the Prater’s Viennese Park. AK, headed by Jack Tuwei, met Kipchoge in Eldoret on Monday to deliver a message of goodwill ahead of his Breaking 2 mission in October. Tuwei said he believes Kipchoge has what it takes to break the barrier and make history, going by his consistency and focus over the years. “We requested Kipchoge to come here so that we can deliver to him our best wishes ahead of his Breaking 2 Mission,” said Tuwei who was flanked by senior vice president Paul Muwtii and Team Kenya manager to Doha worlds,               Joseph Kiget. Besides, Kipchoge, Tuwei also wished the marathon team to Doha best wishes. He said the team will depart next week for the world event and it was important for him to visit before they depart. “As a federation, we came here to wish Kipchoge and the marathon team well ahead of their separate missions,” added Tuwei. Kipchoge believes no human is limited and he is determined to accomplish his mission of Breaking 2. “This is a great challenge for Kipchoge as well as Kenyans who will be following it. As a federation, we know he will make it through our blessings,” said Tuwei.
