Digital strategist Dennis Itumbi has dared the office of the Director of Criminal Investigations to summon him instead of issuing constant threats. Itumbi has been to court on several occasions in connection with the alleged fake letter on an assassination plot against Deputy President William Ruto. He said on Thursday through Twitter that detectives have been harassing individuals whom he said are allied to Ruto. Itumbi claimed that police officers pursued one of his colleagues to Mai Mahiu and snatched his phone. He added that the man had not committed any crime and had only gone to visit his friend in prison. His complaints come hours after the court released one of the witnesses in his case, who had filed an application to withdraw as a witness against Itumbi. The court released Samwel Gateri on Sh100,000 bail after denying charges before Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi. Gateri allegedly made a document, a letter dated May 30, purporting to have been signed by a cabinet secretary in the fake Ruto assassination letter. Itumbi added that cases are won in court by tabling enough evidence and will not be won through 'intimidation and sideshows'.
