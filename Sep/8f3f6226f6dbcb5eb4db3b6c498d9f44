The DCI has stepped up investigations on how KQ lost Sh100 billion in 10 years in operational missteps that have sent the airline to its knees. The DCI has written to Kenya Airways seeking to be furnished with documents for investigations into procurement flaws in an aircraft engine repairs contract. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations wants the airline’s procurement guidelines since 2015 and procurement plan for the financial years 2017/18 – 2018/19. Also sought is KQ’s budget plan, tender advertisements related to the contract, tender documents by the potential bidders, and details of the procurement committee which authorized the award. In a letter to managing director Sebastian Mikosz, Abdalla Komesha of the Banking Fraud Investigation Unit has also demanded evaluation reports on the tender. Final sourcing reports, details of the composition of the KQ board and management structure are also required by the DCI. The detectives are also looking for tender approval minutes by the committee in respect of the engine repairs contract and board papers requesting for board approval for tender awards. The DCI further wants tender approval minutes by the KQ board and letters of contract awards for the two financial years. Komesha is at the same time wants KQ to furnish his office with contract documents, payment documents, and all correspondences include e-mails about the tender. The DCI is conducting a probe to ascertain whether KQ staff conspired to bring down the airline. The probe was triggered by an audit report prepared by the audit firm Deloitte four years ago.
