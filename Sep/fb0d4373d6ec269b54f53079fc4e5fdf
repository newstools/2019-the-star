Rapper Octopizzo says he rarely posts or does random collabos with artistes, but when he spots a talent, he supports them. He was responding to a question on whether he was throwing shade at his fellow rapper Khaligraph when he uploaded a short clip of a raw rap cypher by a group of upcoming rappers from Kayole. The upcoming rappers have been introduced into the scene by online comedian Kartelo, who serves as the hype man in the cypher published on YouTube on Monday. Rapper Lucci from the group has left many impressed, and Octopizzo gave him a big endorsement, saying he is the King of Kayole. “Now this is a Raw Cypher sio hizo zingine zenye ziko Choreographed kwa studio na rangi nyingi na MamoShi. Hapa ukiona moshi jua ni chain inatembea S/O sana @kartelo_official na Gang yangu yote ya Oyole. Na kuanzia leo king wa Kayole natambua ni LUCCI #EndaUmwambie,” Octopizzo wrote. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, he dismissed claims he was addressing Khaligraph. "That artiste is so lit. I don't have time to throw shade, I mean I am too busy to think about another man, if I have something to say about an artiste, I tell them to the face. If I don't like you I don't, and there is nothing you gonna do," he said. Octopizzo said he will be taking Lucci to the studio to record his song and that is why he posted him on social media. "My fans know that I rarely post any artiste until I am impressed with what they are doing. I am not a person who always posts people on my page, and I don't care what people think about that," he said.
