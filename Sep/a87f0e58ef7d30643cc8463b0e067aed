A policeman and two Kenya Pipeline employees have been convicted of robbery with violence and theft of 33,000 litres of fuel worth Sh3.4 million. The three were among six suspects arrested by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations at KPC's No 6 pump station sampling point in Makindu on the night of October 20, 2017. AP Antony Wekesa, Antony Kiiru - the sub-station manager - and Michael Mutisya - a KPC employee, were on Thursday convicted by senior Makueni principal magistrate James Mwaniki, who will sentence them on October 1. They were accused of robbery with violence, stealing goods in transit and assault. They were arrested alongside AP David Kitany, Joseph Theuri, the owner of the tanker used in the theft and Bernard Kimotho Makau, a security guard attached to the substation. The three were acquitted. The court found that Kiiru was at the centre of the fuel siphoning. Mutisya used violence to overcome resistance and retain KPC products. Kiiru was at the scene and was seen by a witness unbolting a nut in the pipeline and connect a hosepipe to a waiting tanker. Mutisya facilitated the escape of four suspects in the tanker by forcing the gate open. He also assaulted Aden Abdullahi. Wekesa, who was mandated with the security of the sub-station, failed to prevent a felony. He ordered Kitany not to handcuff four suspects he had arrested and released them, citing 'orders from above'. "He was dishonest and couldn't substantiate his claim that he had been ordered by his superiors to release the tanker," the court ruled. Kitany was acquitted on grounds that he was acting on orders from his senior with the court acknowledging his efforts to arrest the suspects before they were freed. Theuri was not connected to the theft and was also freed. Kimotho was not in control of a matter being handled by his bosses and was freed. The three will appear in the same court for sentencing on October 1. Edited by R.Wamochie
