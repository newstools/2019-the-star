Eight suspects who have been collecting over Sh39 million from unsuspecting job seekers in a Kuwait Job scam were on Tuesday night arrested. They are; Franline Otieno, Kevin Olondi, Stella Cheruto, Joseph Gikonyo, Catherine Ngendoi, Habiba Shafi, Aisha Mohamed and Mary Ogola. The eight were arrested at a Nairobi hotel by DCI detectives and are to beÂ arraigned in court after being processed. In a tweet on Wednesday, DCI George Kinoti said by 16 September, over 300 victims had been defrauded up to Sh 130,000 each. The money was allegedly to cater for Logistics, Training and Transport to Kuwait. According to Kinoti, a suspect who is at large, allegedly from National Youth Service headquarters has been receiving the money estimated to be in the range of millions, with the promise that the group would be transported to NYS HQs before exit to JKIA. "She is being sought and interrogation of the eight ongoing," Kinoti said.
