Residents of Naivasha were left in shock after the body of a disabled minor was found near Hopewell estate on Thursday morning. Police collected the body which did not have any documentation or personal effects. The incident came a week after another man's body was discovered dumped along the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu highway. Alfred Kuria, a witness, said the minor did not hail from the area and the body must have been dumped at the scene. He said that a car had been seen in the wee hours dropping something on the scene before speeding off. “The body was discovered by wananchi and had deep cuts on various parts,” he said. Meanwhile, in Mai Mahiu an eight-month-old baby who had been abandoned in a daycare centre by its mother has died. The baby was pronounced dead on arrival at a private health centre where she had been rushed after she developed complications. Activist Jennifer Ngure said that the child's mother dropped her off at the centre and promised the caretaker that she was going to buy diapers but failed to return. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru confirmed both incidents. Both bodies have been collected and taken to the subcounty hospital mortuary. In the case of the murdered minor, Waweru said, it was evident that the body was ferried to the scene. Police have collected fingerprints to assist with identification.
