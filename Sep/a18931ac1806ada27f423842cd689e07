Residents have welcomed the nominees for the Wajir County Public Service Board, saying the list represents the region's ethnic diversity and gender balance. Governor Mohamed Abdi on Friday nominated Jelle Abdi Ibrahim and Adow Osman Ahmed to be the board's chairman and secretary respectively. Jelle is a career civil servant who was until his nomination the county director for  agriculture. Adow is an auditor. Rukia Ali, Deka Noor, Mohamud Abdi, Ahmed Hassan and Rashid Sheikh were nominated as the board members. Their nomination follows the expiry of the term of the board's previous members. The new team will serve for six years if approved by the county assembly. Speaking to the press in Wajir town, Mohamed Hussein an activist said that the nominees were people with experience and integrity whose services were greatly needed. “I want to challenge them to strive to serve the people of Wajir with impartiality. They should not make decisions or appointments based on which clan one comes from because they also have names to protect at the end of the day,” Governor Abdi said. Resident Rahma Dahir said the nominees have earned the governor's trust and should serve with honesty. "It would be wrong for them to resort to giving jobs to their relatives and cronies. “We expect them to oversee cleanup of the human resource department through thorough auditing so ghost workers are eradicated," she said. In a letter dated August 30, Abdi urged the county assembly to expedite the vetting of the nominees to facilitate a smooth transition. He said all constitutional requirements like regional balance, ethnic diversity, and gender balance were considered in the nomination process. “They were nominated from among the names recommended by a selection panel constituted for the purpose of selecting suitable candidates for appointment to the board through a competitive process. All subcounties are represented,” Abdi told the Star on the phone.  edited by peter obuya
