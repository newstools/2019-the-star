After joining KCB from Kisumu All Stars fast-rising goal poacher Samuel Mutanda is targeting to break to the national U-20 Rising and the U-23 Emerging Stars teams. Mutanda 19 netted 10 goals last season to inspire All Stars to automatic promotion to the Kenyan Premier League barely two seasons in existence after assuming the void left by the disbanded Palos FC in 2018. “Besides achieving the club objectives I am targeting to break to the national teams. I believe through hard work both the U-20 and 23 coaches will be able to consider me for the next assignments,” said Mutanda. “It’s never easy for a player to be called to the national team especially when you play for a club based away from Nairobi. You have to be outstanding and consistent but since I have joined KCB, I think the route has been shortened for me.” The striker, meanwhile, is not afraid of competition for playing time at KCB, against the experienced forwards he joined the club with. Former Sofapaka captain Stephen Waruru, former Sony Sugar skipper Enock Agwanda and Stephen Onyango from Fortune Sacco also joined the bankers. The quartet joins Benson Amianda and Chrispunus Onyango. “The forward line looks star-studded on paper but the performance on the pitch will filter the beat from us," observed Mutanda. "Everyone wants to play and it means I have to deliver whenever the coach gives me the opportunity.”
