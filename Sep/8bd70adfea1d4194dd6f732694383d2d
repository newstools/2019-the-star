Nairobi Woman Rep Esther Passaris has been admitted at the Aga Khan Hospital for a Medial Branch Block procedure plus Paraspinal. A medial branch nerve block is a procedure in which an anesthetic is injected near small medial nerves connected to a specific facet joint. Typically several levels of the spine are injected in one procedure. Passaris shared through her Twitter page on Monday about admission and her condition. She has been battling backaches for almost 20 years which started after her pregnancy. She said the pain has been a matter of recurrence, which comes on and off. Passaris went through thyroidectomy surgery to remove her goiter in February at Nairobi hospital which had been growing for 10 years. The city Woman Rep is under the care of Dr. Thikra Shariff and Livingstone Olunya. Passaris said she has been struggling to keep her back balanced for longer and it has caused her sleepless nights. “ I can't sleep. I look so exhausted. I don't sleep at night. I just keep turning on the bed even with the painkillers. The horizontal position is terribly painful,” Passaris said. Passaris said the tests she has gone through has cost her a lot. She said the country has professional doctors who can do better if Universal Health Care is fully rolled out in all public hospitals. “ With Universal Health Care, if we can get all our public hospitals to be efficient, we have very good doctors in Kenya,” She added. She has urged Kenyans to embrace UHC but added that most of the Kenyans do not pay for insurance cover.
