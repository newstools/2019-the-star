Jubilee candidate in the upcoming Kibra by-election McDonald Mariga has told residents that he is seeking to serve and not be a boss. The former Harambee Stars forward said that he will not sit comfortably in his office if he wins the race. Mariga said that he will rather be moving around Kibra constituency in order to know the challenges faced by Kibra residents. "Hatutaki ofisi ya kukaa uko penye watu wanaingia na unawahepa na nyuma. Tunataka tutembeee kila mahali Kibra tujue shida zote," Mariga said. Mariga spoke on Wednesday at a meeting held at Deputy President William Ruto's official residence in Karen where Kibra residents were invited. Former footballer promised Kibra people to change the face of Kibra and provide sports facilities to the youths in the area and help them achieve their goals. "Tumeona tuwawachie vijana ball na tena tuje tuwafundije ili mufike pale ambapo tumefika. Kwa hivyo mambo ya sports in general tutaitengeneza," Mariga said. Ruto who attended the rally raised the issue of incomplete projects in Kibra. He said that the government will institute a working mechanism, which will restructure and conclude the programs under the reformed NYS which will benefit Kibra community. The campaigns for the November 7th by-elections have gained momentum with each party drumming up support for their candidates. The defiant Jubilee nominated MP Mina Kamanda led ODM campaign on Sunday, asking people of Kibra to vote for Imram Okoth. Kamanda hosted a delegation of members from the Agikuyu community in Kibra during a meeting with Imran. Kamanda last Thursday declared his support for Imran after a meeting with ODM party leader Raila Odinga. The seat which fell vacant after the death of the late Ken Okoth has attracted 24 aspirants. Other candidates are ANC's Eliud Owalo, Khamisi Butichi of Ford Kenya, Titus Mutinda of the Republican Liberty Party, Elija Abusa of Martha Karua’s Narc Kenya, Hamida Mala of UGM among others.
