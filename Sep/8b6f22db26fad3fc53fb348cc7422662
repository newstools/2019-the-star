 The increased use of plastic bottles should be curtailed to limit environmental pollution, Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi has said. Abdi said lack of a proper take-back, including recycling mechanisms, means plastics used in the packing of water and other drinks have been left to choke the environment. He cited Wajir town which he said was grappling with increased solid waste, especially plastic bottles that are littered everywhere. The waste clog drainage system causing flooding during the rainy season. In a speech read on his behalf by county secretary Abdullahi Hassan during the World Clean-Up Day on Saturday, the governor said the problem can only be tackled through a collaborative effort that involves the community. “To ensure sustainable management of our environment and the natural resources, we appreciate and encourage partnerships and collaborations with the municipality, individuals and communities, public, private and cooperates, local leaders, business communities and organizations as the first urgent step in environmental conservation,” he said. Experts say the sophistication of waste management systems is not evolving at the same rate as production and at the right stages to deal with the increasing levels of plastic garbage.  edited by peter obuya
