Three men serving 20 years for murder were sentenced to 15 more years for sexually molesting to a 17-year-old in 2017. Dickson Murangiri, 27, Geoffrey Mutethia, 22, and Boniface Kimathi, 26, faced charges of sodomizing the minor at Meru police station. The convicts were charged with committing the crime on March 23, 2017, at the cells in Imenti North. They also faced an alternative charge of committing an indecent act and causing bodily harm to the complainant. The September 4 sentence will add to that delivered on January 22 for murder. Meru chief magistrate Hannah Ndung’u ruled that the five prosecution witnesses proved beyond any reasonable doubt the accused gang-raped the complainant in turns. The three are serving 20 years after being found guilty of killing Julius Mung’athia at Maibuki village in Igembe North in 2012. According to court files, the minor was held at the station awaiting age assessment after being charged with assault and causing bodily harm/ He was to be presented to Meru Level 5 Hospital the following day when the three lured him to the washroom and molested him. He reported the act to a police officer who escorted him to the hospital the following morning. The minor testified that the three had identified themselves to him during supper. He identified them during a parade at Meru GK prison. “Dickens(Murangiri) called me at around 10pm saying he had something he wanted to inquire while I was asleep in my cell. The door was not closed so I went out. He pulled me to washrooms and there were some lights peeping in. We found Boniface and Geoffrey inside," the plaintiff told the court. Medical reports presented in court as evidence showed that the minor had been abused. Edited by R.Wamochie
