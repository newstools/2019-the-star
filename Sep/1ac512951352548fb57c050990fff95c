A civil society group wants Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu to resign for the county to function properly. Toilet Paper Movement national coordinator John Wamagata said there are several cases filed in court challenging Deputy Governor James Nyoro's attempt to transfer executives. He said the law to be changed so that a deputy governor can transfer, hire and fire executives and chief officers whenever a governor is suspended or barred from going or working owing to cases of graft. Wamagata said Nyoro tried to move CECs but the law barred him. "We need to have county laws reviewed. We have witnessed the deputy governor's efforts to transfer executives have failed since he has no executive powers to do so" he said. "He was doing that to enable him perform in the remain time of their term. On the other hand, the governor who has a pending case in court, cannot come and do that" he said. Wamagata added that given that the DCI and DPP were also investigating other graft cases in Kiambu, residents were not sure if Waititu will be back in the office again to finish his term. "If Waititu really loves the people of Kiambu, the most honourable thing he can do now is to resign so that he can give his deputy a chance to take the oath of office and work so that he can achieve the promises they had during their previous campaigns" he said. Waititu, his wife Susan Wangari and eight county officials are facing corruption charges over the irregular award of tenders worth Sh588 million. Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi ordered Waititu to stay out of office, during the time case will be heard.
