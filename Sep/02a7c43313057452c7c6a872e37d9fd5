Police are investigations a case in which a colleague shot himself at Garsen police station in Tana River on Wednesday afternoon. The officer referred to as Constable Ekeno,30, shot himself using his G3 riffle,  according to a police report seen by the Star. “The deceased placed the muzzle under his chin while lying on his back and pulled the trigger. His face and forehead were blown up. He died at the scene,” reads the report. County police commander Fredrick Ochieng yesterday said that the officer threatened his colleagues and shot in the air several times before shooting himself. He said that the officer, who was recently an AP before the police wing was  merged with Kenya Police, may have shown signs of stress which his commanders failed to detect. His body was taken to Malindi Subcounty Hospital mortuary. The suicide comes two weeks after a prison warder shot his colleague accidentally at Hola Prison. The officer was undertaking procedural safety precaution while returning a gun back to the store when ammunition fired from the chamber critically injured another officer who was nearby. The injured officer Joseph Katana was pronounced dead on arrival at Malindi Subcounty Hospital. In April, Likoni deputy OCS Joab Omondi shot a woman dead before killing himself. Peninah Kaimenyi, a bartender at Lovely Bar in Mtongwe, was killed before the officer shot himself. In January, another police officer attached to Mombasa Port locked himself in a toilet and shot himself dead.
