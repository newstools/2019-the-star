Just recently Nicki Minaj announced on her Twitter handle that she's retiring from music to start a family with her fiance, Kenneth Petty. The rapper then went on Twitter to apologise for her ‘abrupt’ and ‘insensitive’ retirement tweet. But is she still retiring from the music industry? After seemingly announcing her retirement from music in a surprising tweet on a Thursday, fans of the rapper expressed their shock and confusion. "Can you please just address this retirement thing,” one of her fans wrote. “You never left us so hurt your entire career. We’re just hurting Nicki." "I’m still right here," Minaj, 36, reassured the fan on Twitter. "Still madly in love with you guys and you know that." "In hindsight, this should’ve been a Queen Radio discussion and it will be," she continued, referring to her Apple Beats 1 show. "I promise you guys will be happy. No guests, just us talking about everything." "The tweet was abrupt and insensitive, I apologise babe ❤️🙏," Minaj added. The Anaconda hit-maker promised her fans that she would explain everything soon. Most rappers announce of retirements when they want to get more attention from the public. Nicki Minaj has publicly mused before about whether it’s time for her to quit music. In 2012, she deleted her Twitter account after a song leaked.
