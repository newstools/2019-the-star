The Jubilee Party on Tuesday issued former Harambee Stars international McDonald Mariga with a nomination certificate. Mariga together with Jubilee Party officials is expected to present their papers to the IEBC later today at 4 pm for clearance ahead of the Kibra by-election on November 7. Presenting the certificate to Mariga was party secretary general Raphael Tuju who called for a peaceful campaign period and election. "We should all remember that there will be a winner and a loser but we will all remain to be Kenyans," he said. Mariga thanked the party for believing in him and assured that he is equal to the task. "Kazi ianze sasa..imebaki kwenda kwa mafans. (Let the work now begin. The only thing left now is to go to the supporters," Mariga said. Accompanying him were MPs Didmas Barasa (Kimilili), Caleb Kositany (Soy), Nixon Korir (Lang'ata) and Gladys Shollei (Uasin Gishu woman representative).
