A 25-year old man from Kator village within Kabarnet town, Baringo Central suspected of stealing and selling a Sh200 mallet has been found dead. Kibowen Kimaliny reportedly went missing from home on Tuesday evening but his body was found floating on a half-full cattle dip at Emgos on Wednesday around 11am. A resident told the Star the owner had reported the missing tool at Kabarnet police station and Kimaliny was being sought for arrest. “We cannot tell exactly if the cause of his death is the lost mallet, but I understand he used to make a living by crashing stone for gravel near Kator trading centre,” Kabarnet chief Stephen Chepyegon said. Kamaliny's uncle Wesley Korir accused police of laxity saying the body lay uncollected in the cattle dip until 5pm. Korir appealed to the county government to consider fencing off cattle dips and the other water sources to avert such preventable cases in future. Police took the body to the county referral hospital mortuary in Kabarnet town, awaiting postmortem. County police commander Robinson Ndiwa declined to comment on the incident. “I am not allowed to comment on such incidents. Maybe you can get more information from the county commissioner Henry Wafula,” Ndiwa said. Locals led by Mary Kipngok attributed the death to drunkenness caused by idleness among jobless youths in the area. “Both the national and the county governments should be ready to take responsibility for failing to create jobs to occupy the learned and skilled jobless youth in the society,” Kipngok said.
