COTU secretary General Francis Atwoli made delegates laugh after joking that ODM party leader Raila Odinga was the worst organizer. He was giving opening remarks on Friday to invite Raila who is set to address the OATUU conference in Nairobi. "To me Raila Odinga is a terrible organiser I have ever met in my life...You will be with Raila until 2am and leave one another to go and rest but the next day you open TV and see him miles away from where you met addressing Kenyans, being made an elder of that community and yet you are still tired," he said. "That is why to me, you are a wonderful organizer and no politician fits the bill of such a title." Atwoli who showered Raila with praises for over 15 minutes, said the party leader befits all his nicknames which include;  Agwambo, the enigma in Kenyan politics among others. "I look at Raila's life and for us who labour for workers and come from pressure groups, we have always admired you," he said. "Obama's father was from the same village where your were born ...and that is why we have wonderful people like you that make global impact." Raila who stood up said "What he forgot to tell you is that he is the cousin to president Obama." The Central Organisation of Trade Unions in conjunction with the Organisation of African Trade Union Unity  hosted a joint women workshop at the Sarova Stanley, Nairobi Kenya under the Theme: – Ending Violence and Harassment at the World of Work.
