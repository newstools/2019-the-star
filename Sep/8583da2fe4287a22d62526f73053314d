Former World Rally Championships winner Stig Blomqvist will make a return to the Kenya scene in a TIDO Porsche during the  Safaricom-sponsored East African Safari Classic Rally in November. Blomqvist, 73, raced in Kenya between 1970 and 2002 in the World Rally Championships and has used over 20 models of different cars including the Saab series, Ford, Audi, Nissan, Skoda, Mitsubishi and Volkswagen among others. He returns to Kenya spotting a TIDO Porsche prepared and run by the Tuthill team. The rally will be run over nine days, starting in Mombasa. The first four days of intense rallying will be on Kenyan soil. This will be followed by a rest day in Tanga, Tanzania where mechanics will get a chance to rebuild the cars, strictly within six hours. The rally will then resume for four days and culminate in prize-giving gala-night. Other drivers who have signed up for the Safaricom-funded event are Phillip Gache who will drive a Mazda RX 7, and USA's husband/wife team of Renee and Juliette Brinkerhoff in a Porsche 356. A unique opportunity presents itself this year with the arrival of a Nissan 240RS, an iconic rally car synonymous with the past editions of Safari Rally. The car will be driven by ex-Kenyan Joey Ghose and world-renowned navigator Stephane Prevot. Organisers are engaging the local community to ensure the rally maintains high standards of safety. Raju Kishnani, the EASCR director, is optimistic about the team’s plan. “We want to empower the locals to be part of this unique event. We have an elaborate plan involving the local Boda-Boda Sacco and its huge memberships. They will be deployed throughout the route, especially at key junctions and villages to assist in crowd control and to minimise traffic within the stages,” said Kishnani. An extensive recce for the event has been carried out, covering over 18,000km by a team of officials led by Raju Chagger, the Clarke of the Course. According to Chagger, an independent crew will check the final road book.
