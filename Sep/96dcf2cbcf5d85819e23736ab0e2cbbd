 A man has petitioned the High Court seeking a declaration that prisoners be allowed to fully participate in general elections. Wilson Kinyua says prisoners were denied their constitutional right to vote during the 2017 General Election was limited to only the presidential race. They were not allowed to cast their ballots for the governor, senator, woman representative, MP and MCA. Kinyua has named the Attorney General, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and Prisons Service as respondents. He claims the respondents reached a boardroom decision to deny or limit prisoners' voting rights. The decision is not reasonable. he says. "The respondent violated article 38 of the Constitution and circumvented orders of the court declaring that prisoners have a right to participate in the general election,” Kinyua says. He wants the court to declare that prisoners, just like other citizens, have the right and freedom to choose to be registered as voters in any part of the country. He has also sought a declaration that the state through prison authorities be given the responsibility to facilitate prisoners right to vote by availing them at their respective polling stations. Kinyua says the court should find that prisoners are within Kenyan territorial borders and there is no justification to treat them as though they are in the diaspora. “We urge the court to compel IEBC to register prisoners to vote in all the elective seats in the 2022 General Election,” the affidavits read.  edited by peter obuya
