Embu residents are set to benefit from a Sh800 million electrification project. The amount will be used to connect more than 15,000 residents. Deputy President William Ruto at the weekend said the government had set aside money to connect all Embu households with electricity. He spoke in Siakago during his tour to the county. Ruto said electricity should not be a reserve for the rich few but for every Kenyan. He said the Jubilee government has reduced the cost of electricity connection and made it affordable for everyone. "Before, one was supposed to pay Sh70,000, but we agreed that citizens should first be connected to electricity and pay later in instalments," the DP said. He said the number of Kenyans who have electricity has risen from 26,000 to 56,000 in six years. A majority of Mbeere South residents, which hosts the Seven Forks Dams, do not have electricity. Area MP Geoffrey Kingangi had earlier urged the Deputy President to help residents get electricity.
