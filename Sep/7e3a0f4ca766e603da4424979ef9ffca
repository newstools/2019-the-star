League leaders Gaspo women’s team have a chance to extend their lead on the log as they prepare top face Mathare United and former champions Thika Queens in the ongoing  FKF women’s Premier League this weekend. Gaspo, who have 60 points from 22 matches, earned the promotion to the top tier this season and face united today at the Ruiru grounds before being hosted by y Thika at their backyard. At the same time, Trans Nzioa Falcons who are joint second with Vihiga Queens on the log with 55 points, will be keen to close the gap on the leaders Gaspo when they play Thika today and Makolanders tomorrow at Camp Toyoyo. Should Trans Nzioa win their two ties, they will have 61 points—five points off leaders Gaspo, assuming they also win the two fixtures that will catapult them to 66 points. Vihiga coach Alex Alumira, however, is cautious of their current position even as they tackle Wadadia at the Mumias Complex Stadium tomorrow. “We are taking one match at a time with a keen eye on the title. We have played 20 matches, won 18, lost one and drawn one. We cannot falter at this stage with few matches remaining to end the season. We just want to build on the wins going forward since our objective is to retain the title,” said Alumira. Other matches on the card today will see Eldoret Falcons welcomes Kibra Girls Soccer Academy at Eldoret University. Tomorrow, Oserian host Mathare United.
