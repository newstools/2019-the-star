Simbas head coach Paul Odera lauded his charges performance after a 36-14 victory over Zimbabwe in the Victoria Cup in Nakuru over the weekend. The Simbas outscored the Sables by five tries to two in an entertaining contest. "The youngsters played well. Our forwards were immense, carried the ball hard and over the advantage line and in defence, we put in big tackles to deny Zimbabwe momentum," said Odera. On attack, Odera said the boys executed well and took their opportunities. "We took our chances well and it was a good display,” noted Odera. Kenya finished second in the Victoria Cup with 21 points with the visitors retaining the title on 22 points. Uganda finished third with 15 points as debutants Zambia propped the standings with not even a point. National Sevens circuit MVP Vincent Onyala scored two tries with Timothy Okwemba, Tony Omondi and Charles Kuka scoring one each. Anthony Odhiambo added one penalty and two conversions with substitute Tony Omondi rounding up the win with two conversions. Kenya led 17-7 at the interval. Meanwhile, Odera said going forward into next year, culture and discipline of the team have to improve as well as synergy from the clubs in terms of preparations. “Next year the technical bench will demand a lot from the players in terms of discipline and I'm confident that they can adjust and deliver," said Odera. "The players' all-round skills — pass and catch, kicking and tackling must be better if we are to match the likes of Namibia next year," he observed. Odera noted that a conference will be held with club coaches and their respective technical teams with an aim of improving the Simbas.
