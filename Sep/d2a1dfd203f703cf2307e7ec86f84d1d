Henrikh Mkhitaryan says he is uncertain over his Arsenal future following his European deadline day move to Roma. The 30-year-old signed for the Italian club on Monday in a season-long loan deal, just 18 months after joining the Gunners. Asked about his long-term future after Armenia’s 3-1 defeat by Italy in Euro 2020 qualifying, Mkhitaryan insisted he was fully focused on Roma. “Let’s first see what I can do in Roma and at the end of the season I think we can talk if I will have the possibility to stay or to go to something else, I don’t know,” the midfielder told VBET News. “Now, I cannot say about the future, it’s better to be focused on the next games.” Roma are currently 15th in the embryonic Serie A table, having thrown away a 3-1 lead to draw 3-3 with Genoa on the opening day of the season. Paulo Fonseca’s side followed up with a 1-1 draw against Lazio on Sunday in the Derby della Capitale. Asked about his favoured position, Mkhitaryan admitted he was willing to play anywhere for the benefit of I Giallorossi. “I’m ready to play in every position and I’m ready to help the team because the club is great,” he said. “The team is a very good team and I’m going to try and do my best to help the team to achieve.” Mkhitaryan was one of two late arrivals at Stadio Olimpico. Roma also signed Manchester Untited defender Chris Smalling on a season-long loan.
