High Court Judge Stella Mutuku has ordered that Sarah Wairimu, wife to the late Tob Cohen be escorted to the Jewish Cemetery to attend the burial of the late husband today at 2 pm. The burial will be held in accordance with the Jewish burial rites and will be private. This comes after Sarah last week filed for an application seeking the court to issue a production order and also be escorted to the Jewish Cemetery. Sarah is accused of murdering her husband and is due for psychiatric assessment before she pleads to the charge on September 26. Jewish tradition prescribes that a person should be buried as quickly as possible, usually after 36 hours, but this would be impractical given the circumstances. Cohen was reported missing from his Lower Kabete home in Nairobi between July 19 and July 20. Sarah also rejected an invitation to witness the opening of Cohenâ€™s will. In a letter by her lawyer Philip Murgor, she said the confidentiality of the document had been impugned after the Star published its contents on September 16, citing a Dutch paper. "We note that the contents of the publication (the Star) have not been denied or retracted and therefore presumed to be correct," the letter addressed Kirundi & Co. advocates said.
