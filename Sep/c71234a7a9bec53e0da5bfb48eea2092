Two boys were detained at Homa Bay police station for allegedly stealing a goat belonging to a villager in Suba South constituency. The students from Mbita High School and Ngodhe Secondary School were intercepted on Thursday evening with the goat in Homa Bay town. The boys aged between 17 and 18 years are both in Form 3. Homa Bay Township senior chief Joshua Ochogo said they arrested the students near one of the abattoirs in the town. They were not in uniform during the arrest. The administrator said inquiries revealed the goat belonged to a villager in Lambwe East. Directives had been given to abattoir operators in Homa Bay not to accept animals brought to them by minors. The students walked with the goat for more than 20km. “We acted on a tip off and found the students with a goat while in the slaughterhouse compound. The animal’s owner confirmed it belonged to him,” Ochogo said. On Friday, the administrator said it was their second time they arrested people with suspected stolen domestic animals in the slaughterhouse. He said they arrested a 22-year-old man with a suspected stolen cow in April. “The students looked suspicious and got stranded after an abattoir operator refused to buy the goat for slaughter,” the administrator said. Speaking to journalists in his office, Homa Bay deputy county commander Samuel Obara said they are finalizing investigations before the students are arraigned. “It’s a crime to be found with or handling stolen property. Investigations are near complete before they are charged with an offense,” Obara said. The police officer warned minors against engaging in criminal activities, noting that they ruin their future. “Let students concentrate on studies for their future benefit because the government has waived school fees. Legal action would be taken against offenders regardless of their age,” he said.
