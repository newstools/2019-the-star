An increase in rates of unintended pregnancies leads to vulnerability to unsafe abortions and high maternal deaths. Children born of young mothers are more likely to have delayed growth and development. Girls born of teen mothers are likely to become teen mothers, especially where role models lack. Children are likely to develop low birth weight and mental disorders. Unhealthy eating habits among young mothers also affect their development as well as that of the newborn. Being mothers at teenage, girls are likely to engage in drug and substance abuse, a behaviour likely to affect the health of the unborn. Prenatal care is essential for monitoring the growth of the baby. We must also eliminate stigma through awareness to reduce the consequences of unintended pregnancy.  Naya Kenya
