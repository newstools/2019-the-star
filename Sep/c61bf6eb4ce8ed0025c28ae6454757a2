The body of a middle-aged woman mistakenly disposed of in Sirisia has been reburied in Kimilili after exhumation. Mary Sakaria was finally laid to rest in her Nakalira village home. She had been buried by a family in Mufungu village instead of Grace Wasike. The women had died separately and on different days and the bodies taken to Dreamland hospital mortuary in Kimilili town. The mix-up resulted in Sakaria's family obtaining a court order for her exhumation. The family, arrived in Sirisia accompanied by police officers, on August 28 and exhumed the body. The body was returned to the Dreamland morgue for preparation and confirmation before reburial at Nakalira on August 29. This was contrary to the Bukusu tradition which requires that a body in a burial mix-up is interred in the middle of the night as a sheep is slaughtered to cleanse the family and appease the ancestors. Clan elder John Walubengo told the Star that the rituals would be performed to avoid calamities in the community. Meanwhile, Grace Wekesa's body is yet to be buried.
