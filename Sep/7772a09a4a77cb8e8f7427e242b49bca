The renowned former Stars’ tactician said he is investing a lot of his money in the academy to accommodates more sportsmen and women. “Right now we are on the verge of expanding the academy. In the coming days we will launch a big project here in Nairobi,” he revealed, adding that soccer is in his bloodstream and he can never relent on revamping the academy to higher levels. “I owe a lot to soccer it is in my blood so I can not desert football for anything else,” he affirmed. Besides his week-day radio duties, Ghost said he creates time on weekends to concentrate on football matters. Mulee narrates how his working relationship with the former FKF went sore after going for months without his monthly salary. “There is a time I worked for 8 months without a single penny. Until today, the federation owes me several million,” he concluded.
