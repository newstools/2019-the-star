Two people were on Wednesday arrested at Kwa Haraka town in Kinangop for allegedly violating the recently gazetted potato regulations. Kelvin Vulimo and an unnamed woman passenger were transporting nine bags of potatoes, each weighing more than the recommended 50kg. Nyandarua director of Agriculture Joseph Wathinja said Vulimo violated the Crop Regulations (Irish potato) 2019, and Crops Act 2013. He is also not registered as a potato transporter. County officials David Mwaniki and Samuel Mathai said the lightest bag weighed 72kg and the heaviest 89kg. Kinangop subcounty police commander Charles Rotich said a multi-agency approach is being used to ensure the new potato law is not violated. â€œThe law was purposely put in place to safeguard the farmers. We shall ensure this law is implemented to the letter," he said.
