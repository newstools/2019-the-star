Eden Hazard ‘p***** off’ team-mate Thibaut Courtois after supposedly losing possession and failing to score on his Real Madrid debut. Madrid raced into a 3-0 half-time lead against Levante thanks to a Karim Benzema double and a goal from Casemiro. Casemiro was replaced by Hazard after an hour as the visitors threatened to cause an upset at the Bernabeu, scoring two goals in the second half. Hazard, who only recently recovered from a thigh injury sustained in pre-season, failed to impress his former Chelsea colleague Courtois though. Speaking after the game, Courtois told Movistar: “He almost scored a goal with what he did (in attack). He has a lot of pace with the ball, it’s what he does. But I got a little p***** off with him because he lost the ball twice.” The goalkeeper added: “We were thinking of a clean sheet at half-time. Sometimes we have to continue in the same way, but we didn’t do that after the break. It became 3-1 and then 3-2 and we knew we couldn’t drop points again. In the end, I was able to make the stop to save us.” “If we kept going like in the first half, with all due respect, we would have won 5-0 or 6-0. We played our best 45 minutes of the year, but this is football. Levante changed their system and we lacked precision with our passing.” The result moved Madrid up to fourth in the early La Liga standings, having won two and drawn two of their opening four matches.
