The competitors will test their skills on the 3km stretch to try and achieve the highest speeds on the uphill stretch. The stretch starts from the bottom of a hill at 1900m to the top at 2200m, testing the drivers’ abilities to see who can drive fastest uphill on a course with a mixture of sharp bends and corners. Machines ranging from ordinary rally cars to buggies and motorcycles will be the centre of attraction as the event promises thrills. Malewa Bay, situated on Moi North Lake road within outskirts of Naivasha, will host the competition. The competition stretch has been graded to make sure competitors are able to achieve the highest speeds.
