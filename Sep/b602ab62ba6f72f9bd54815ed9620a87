TV presenter Lillian Muli on Thursday shared a rare photo of her showing her forehead on her Instagram page. Word had it that in an awful mishap, she suffered a severe injury that left a permanent scar on her forehead. It is alleged that the scar was bad to the point that she was compelled to conceal it using her hair. This is the reason why she has over the years had a signature hairstyle, where she covers her forehead with a fringe. But the photo she shared on social media confirms it all. In the photo, Lillian looks stunning and younger after shaving her hair and  she once said, “You live once, have fun while you’re at it. Do stuff that makes you feel good." From the look of things, Lillian is actually doing exactly that. The photo is a confirmation that the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears or the way she combs her hair. In July Muli posted a picture of her new hairstyle on Instagram, explaining that her locks, normally hidden by a wig, had to go because they were thinning. “I shaved my locks because they thinned after I had a baby. I will miss them, though,” she said. In the recent photo she posted on her Instagram page she has no scare as some people thought.
