Controversial televangelist pastor James Ng’ang’a has been fined Sh1 million by the Communications Authority for exposing a woman’s breast on his online platform, Sasa TV. CAK’s communication officer Chimbiru Gimode said on Friday the authority relied on sections of the Kenya Information and Communications Act of the Kenya Broadcasting Regulations to pass the verdict. The Programming Code for broadcasting prohibits the broadcasting explicit or graphic descriptions of sexual organs, other sensitive parts of the body, and acts generally considered indecent or offensive during the watershed period is prohibited. “Unless there is a strong editorial justification, explicit or graphic descriptions of sexual organs, other sensitive parts of the body, and acts generally considered indecent or offensive are prohibited,” state a section of the guidelines. Ng'ang'a allegedly ignored an earlier warning against indecent exposure of obscene scenes on his channel. The watershed period is between 5am and 10pm and content broadcast during this period must be suitable for family listening and viewing. Programmes deemed to contain strong adult themes or obscenities are not supposed to be aired during this period. “Any programmes or movies classified or rated for adults only shall not be aired during this period.” Ng’ang’a defended himself in an online video saying he has no control over what happens during moments of deliverance of his congregants from evil spirits. “Recently I was prosecuted for showing breasts. But how could I have known breasts were exposed yet they are not mine?” Ng’ang’a said. Ng’anga’ has in recent days become an online sensation where he’s mostly filmed dramatically exorcising what is believed to be demons from his followers.
