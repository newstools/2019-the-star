Juventus reportedly wanted to unite Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar this summer as the Italian champions ‘offered Paulo Dybala plus €100million (£90m)’ to land the wantaway Brazilian this summer. Neymar made no secret of his desire to leave Paris Saint-Germain this summer with a return to Barcelona widely expected in the final days before the transfer window closed. But after the window shut and Neymar remained at PSG, Tuttosport revealed that Juventus made their own play to land him as they wanted to form a ‘dream duo’ with Ronaldo in Turin. Neymar, who is yet to feature for PSG this season while the club sorted his future, pushed for an exit all summer but the focus remained on a return to Spain. Dybala appeared to be the domino that would set other moves in motion after moves to Manchester United and Tottenham collapsed earlier in the month.  But Dybala went on to dig his heels in and remain with Ronaldo in Turin, which saw any bid for Neymar ended due to a lack of other viable negotiating chips. The Tuttosport report goes on to say that even with Dybala as part of Juventus’ offering, PSG rejected the offer as they held out for more money for Neymar, having spent £198m to acquire him from Barcelona two years ago. Ronaldo has adapted well since swapping Real Madrid for Juventus last season and played a key role in the club securing an eighth straight Serie A title. Already off the mark with a goal this season, the Portuguese is tasked with spearheading the club’s bid to end their barren run - stretching back to 1996 - without lifting the craved Champions League trophy. For Neymar, he will now be expected to reintegrate in Thomas Tuchel’s PSG side following the conclusion of the international break. The Brazilian has seen the loan arrival of Mauro Icardi add competition for places and he will be forced to wait until January at the earliest before looking to force another exit.
