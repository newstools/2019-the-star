Nominated City MCA Anne Thumbi on Tuesday accompanied Jubilee candidate for Kibra by-election, MacDonald Mariga, to IEBC offices for verification. Thumbi seconded Mariga while he presented his documents to the electoral commission. Thumbi, who is the mother of the late Kibra MP Ken Okoth's son, was seen sitting next to Mariga during the verification which ended in Mariga being blocked from vying. Mariga's details were missing from the IEBC register, prompting the returning officer to invalidate his candidature. Thumbi came to limelight after the death of Okoth after she blocked the late MP's interment, saying she had been locked out of preparations for his final send off. She demanded a DNA test be done, which confirmed Okoth sired her son. Through lawyer Elkana Mogaka, Thumbi, sued Okoth's mum Angeline Okoth and wife Monica Okoth along with Lee funeral home. "The mother and wife have deliberately and unfortunately excluded me from the funeral and burial arrangements of Okoth," her petition read. KEMRI confirmed that Thumbi's son was Okoth's. Lawyer Danstan Omari said three samples from three local and international labs were taken and tested.
