The flag will be flown half-mast at the State House and all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Republic of Kenya and throughout the Republic of Kenya. This will be done from dawn of Saturday to sunset of Monday. Mugabe died in Singapore at the age of 95. Uhuru on Twitter described Mugabe as courageous, dedicated and a fighter who fought for his nation. "On behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Kenya and on my own behalf, I wish to convey our deepest sympathies and condolences to the Government and the people of the Republic of Zimbabwe following the death of former president Robert Gabriel Mugabe," he said. "In this moment of sorrow, my thoughts and prayers go out to his family, relatives and the people of Zimbabwe who, for many years, he served with commitment and dedication," Uhuru added. Uhuru described Mugabe as a freedom fighter, a Pan Africanist and an elder statesman. Mugabe died on Friday at the age of 95 at a Singapore Hospital. Mugabe was ousted from power in a military coup in November 2017, ending his three-decade reign.
