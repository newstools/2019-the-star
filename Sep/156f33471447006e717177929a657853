Joyce Chepkemboi and Daniel Kemboi defied chilly conditions to win the second edition of Kaptagat Half Marathon yesterday in Kaptagat. Chepkemboi, who finished third last year, displayed top form as she ran away with the title,  beating a host of other elite and inexperienced runners to the title. The athlete, who trains in Kapsabet but hails from Nakuru won the title in 74:10 ahead of Judith Korir (74:34) and Agnes Kemboi (75:25) for podium positions. Chepkemboi, who has the ambitions of running at the top level, said the race was an eye-opener as she was chasing her best time in the 21km distance. “The race was too competitive especially in hilly section but I handled the situation well,” said Chepkemboi. Chepkemboi maintained the lead after the 5km mark to win the race. “I like running in front to give as this gives me the power to control the race. Once I am in the lead, it's difficult for any athlete to keep pace and that is what I did here," added Chepkemboi. Kemboi clocked 63:08 to win the men's race.  He becomes the second athlete from Global Sports Communication to win the race after two-time Toronto Marathon Champion Philemon Rono won last year. “I am happy that the title went back to our camp. I train with great athletes like Eliud Kipchoge and Geoffrey Kamworor and this gives me a lot of psyches to run well,” he added. He said the fact that he was running at home ground was an added advantage for him as he was cheered all the way to the finish. “My target this year was to win the race on the home soil. I was too strong for the race and even after finishing, I felt like running some more,” he added. Former Kass marathon winner Albert Kangogo (63:12) and Micah Chesire (63:45) completed the podium.
