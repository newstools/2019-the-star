Narok county leaders have promised to find a durable solution to competing tending Mau interests — conserving Mau Forest and safeguarding the livelihoods of evictees. “We don’t want to run away from this issue, but we will handle it amicably so we can achieve a win-win situation for everybody living there,” Tunai said on Friday. The county boss urged residents to remain calm and politicians to refrain from politicising the Mau issue. Tunai was joined at a press briefing by MPs Korei  Lemein (Narok South), Gabriel Tongoyo (Narok West), Johanna Ng'eno (Emurua Dikirr) and Gideon Konchellah (Kilgoris). Also present were Deputy Governor Evelyn Aruasa,  assembly majority leader Bernard Parsaloi, MCAs Wesley Koech (Sagamian), Samuel Kositany (Ilmotiok), Philemon Aruasa (Melelo), Francis Turgut (Sogoo), Jefferson Langat (Ololulunga) and Elvis Kirui (nominated). They said that while the Mau issue is of national importance, it is also an exceptional issue for Narok because the forest is a county trust land, while the people being evicted are residents. “We thank residents of Narok for maintaining peace during this tense situation," Tunai said. "We are consulting on the best way to handle the emerging crisis and over the next few days will reach an agreement and present joint recommendations to the national government and the people of Narok,” he said. Lemein asked county leaders not to make statements that cause panic and despondency. “Politicians need to weigh their words, lest they cause unnecessary tribal tension among residents,” the MP said. Konchellah told leaders outside Narok county to stay away from the Mau issue and allow local leaders to handle it. (Edited V. Graham)
