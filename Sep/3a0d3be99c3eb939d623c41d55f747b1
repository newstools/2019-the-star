ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has told Kenyans to beware of politicians using fundraisers to clean dirty money. Musalia, through his private secretary Kibisu Kabatesi, on Thursday singled out Deputy President William Ruto for criticism. He claimed the DP and his backers could be cleaning looted money as the deadline for the demonetisation of the old Sh1,000 notes nears. The ANC leader told Ruto to first clean his image of the corruption tags before seeking an alliance with him. No politician would risk teaming up with a person tainted with all sorts of corruption accusations, Musalia said, terming Ruto's calls for liaison ahead of the 2022 presidential race as deceitful, cheeky, mischievous and untrustworthy. The DP had, during a funds drive in Luanda on Saturday, asked Musalia to join his camp to form the next government. "In fact, the DP owes Mudavadi an apology for sabotaging his 2013 bid after President Uhuru Kenyatta, then TNA leader, accepted to back him (Mudavadi)." Kabatesi was referring to the 'madimoni' slur by Uhuru after a pre-election pact collapsed in 2013. Musalia said he owes no one a political debt as claimed by Ruto. He and Ruto campaigned for ODM leader Raila Odinga in the 2007 race and the DP should instead demand his debt from the right person. He dismissed as of no consequence Ruto's promise of tarmacking the Mago-Mululu-Wangulu Road in Sabatia constituency. “That is a national government project budgeted for by Parliament through efforts by area MP Alfred Agoi and Ruto cannot, therefore, refer to it as a present." He added, “If the DP has to claim credits from the national government he should do so on corruption as well." Edited by R.Wamochie
