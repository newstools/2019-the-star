South Sudan President Salva Kiir and former rebel leader Riek Machar have agreed to form a transitional government. The information minister on Wednesday said the new administration would be in place by mid-November. The two leaders have been holding their first face-to-face talks in months in South Sudan's capital, Juba. They signed a peace agreement last year to end a civil war in which hundreds of thousands died. The government says it lacks the funds for a key part of the deal involving the integration of former rebels into the national army.
