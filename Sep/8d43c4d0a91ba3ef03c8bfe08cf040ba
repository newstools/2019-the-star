United States International University Spartans coach Willis Okeyo made a rallying call to his players to improve their overall play despite beating Sliders 1-0 in the women’s Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) Premier League. Grace Akumu scored the lone goal in 57th minute. Okeyo observed that the girls need to get their rhythm back after a boring display. “Yesterday we were far from our best for sure. We need to hit the ground running in all departments. We didn’t create enough chances and we were lucky to win the match. As much this will inspire the team, we need to up our game, going forward,” he said. “The girls are back from the holidays and this is our first match in over a month. We have to get our intensity back and we must improve on our defence and attacking departments.” His counterpart Linet Onyango blamed poor officiating for their loss. This prompted Sliders to protest the decision. “The goal should not have stood because there was no body contact. It is heartbreaking to fight for 57 minutes and the umpire makes a wrong call with three minutes to go. We could not play anymore.” The victory moves USIU to the second spot with 17 points— nine points behind leaders Telkom. In the super League, leaders Parkroad Badgers dropped their first points this season following their 1-1 all draw with Kenyatta University. Parkroad have won their last 12 matches. Gilbert Langat 42nd minute strike was cancelled by Brian Nguru who levelled matters for the students with eight minutes left. Coach Simon Mwangi said confidence is back following the draw and that the students are prepared for a good run.
