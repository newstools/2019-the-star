Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has told politicians to stop pushing for a constitutional review until sufficient public participation is done. Kuria has said that some political leaders have individualised the push for a referendum without factoring in Kenyans’ views. He hit out at Thirdway Alliance leader Ekuru Aukot over his Punguza Mizigo Initiative, saying he has declined calls to have it refined. “I am the one who started the Punguza Mzigo debate but when I reached out to him and told him that his proposals were okay but needed to be discussed, he declined my offer,” he said. Kuria also said it is selfish for political leaders such as opposition leader Raila Odinga to declare that the referendum is inevitable. He said if the law change is being done for the benefit of the country, then Kenyans should be fully involved to give their input. “Kenyans should not be pushed into doing something that they have not been fully involved in. If it is being done for the interest of Kenyans, then why can’t we come together and debate it and decide on the way forward?” Kuria posed. “Let us talk and come up with something that will guide this country for decades,” the MP added. Kuria, who was speaking at Kangari, Murang’a county during the launch of Greening Kenya Foundation on Saturday, also called upon politicians to shun divisive politics that risk hampering the efforts being made to enhance unity in the country. He hit out at Jubilee members who have split into Kieleweke and Tangatanga factions, saying the politics they are playing is not beneficial to the electorate. “We will evaluate all those who will be vying in 2022 and vote for the best but as for now, leaders should concentrate on development issues,” he said.
