A  husband and wife have been charged with sexually assaulting their neighbour’s three-year-old girl. Solomon Kaler and Gladys Nzyoki are accused of fingering the minor's private parts at their house in a Nairobi slum between August 16 and 19. They denied the charges before chief magistrate Heston Nyaga. The mother of the child is said to have left her in the custody of the two accused persons for three days, the period in which they are suspected to have committed the offence. Solomon Kaler also faced an offence of defiling the minor on the same dates and place. It is reported that the minor would complain that she was feeling some pain when relieving herself. The mother then asked the accused persons about what might have happened to her daughter but they claimed ignorance. She then requested money from the accused persons to take her child to hospital but they refused, claiming that they were innocent. It was alleged that the minor had disclosed to her mother that Uncle Solomon had defiled her and sometimes while together with his wife they would finger her privates. The minor’s mother rushed her to the hospital where she filed a P3 form before reporting the matter to the police. The accused persons were subsequently arrested. Nyaga released the couple on a bond of Sh300,000 with a surety of similar amount each. The case will be heard on December 17.
