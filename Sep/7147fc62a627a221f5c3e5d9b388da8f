Gospel singer Moji Short Baba (James Muhia) recently launched his 16-track album, 'Yesu Mtaani', at Nairobi Film Centre. The solo artiste has worked on a song with Daddy Owen in the new album and he said he will be doing a lot of collaborations now and in the near future. The event was one of a kind, bringing different gospel singers, comedians, deejays and secular artistes such as Naiboi in solidarity to show their love and support for Moji Short Baba.
