Former Vihiga County Governor Moses Akaranga has officially joined the race for  Football Kenya Federation (FKF) presidential race ahead of next year's polls. The move complicates decisions by delegates from the western region with two interested contestants having already shown interest in the seat. Former FKF western branch chairman Andrew Amukowa and former Kenya Football Coaches Association deputy secretary-general Khamisi Shivachi both from Western have thrown a hat into the ring for the position. Meanwhile, Akaranga has promised to transform local football by making it more professional if offered a chance. Akaranga said he is keen to bring more reforms in football in a bid to attract sponsors. ''It beats logic to see teams representing the country like Gor Mahia struggling to make ends meet due to lack of support yet little was being done to reverse the trend. "I’m a serious and major football stakeholder having propelled Vihiga United to great heights. I am also doing the same with Vihiga Bullets who are now playing in the National Super League," he added. Akakarnga added that under his leadership, he will ensure the national team, Harambee Stars' selection is fair and captures the regional representation. "I also want to ensure women soccer is well supported and managed," he added. "We need to see players from all corners of the country playing in the national team. We can't continue doing things in the same way and expect different results," pointed out Akaranga. Former Vihiga County chief warned the current administration not to impose strict conditions in order to lock out potential candidates. "We are aware of a few individuals who are now tempering with lists of delegates and trying to lock out some teams from certain regions," he claimed.
