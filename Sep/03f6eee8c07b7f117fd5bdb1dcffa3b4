An MCA in Mombasa fell victim to a new network of fraudsters conning residents through fake house helps. The recruitment agency sends a domestic worker to an employer in need. But the worker's assignment is to survey the home to determine whether the family is wealthy or not. After a while the domestic worker conjures up a story that leads to the employer being conned. “In my case, the domestic worker said her two children had been sent away from school due to outstanding fees. She told me they require Sh3,000 and Sh2,000 respectively,” said nominated MCA Fatma Kushe. She had paid a fee of Sh3,500 to the recruitment agency. Kushe gave the Monicah Mwikali who had worked for her for only two days Sh5,000 on the understanding that the money would be deducted from her pay. A day later, Mwikali called Kushe to say she had got a job in Nairobi and needed to travel urgently. “This shocked me. I called the recruitment agency and explained what had happened so as to get the way forward but they said they would get back to me,” said Kushe. Shortly after, Mwikali erupted. “She started shouting that I had threatened her life, that I wanted to push her from the top floor of my storey house,” the MCA said. Mwikali then went and recorded a statement at Nyali police station, which Kushe also did. Police say similar cases have been reported before. They are investigating several recruitment agencies.
