ODM leader Raila Odinga has rooted for a parliamentary system of government. Raila on Tuesday said a parliametary system was a better way to raise raise the majority threshold in a contest for power. He said the push for a parliamentary system is not about the Executive alone, but creating institutions that can stand up against oppressive leaders. "We have strived to create this through the BBI and many other forums. However, these efforts are hindered by a culture of hatred and fear," Raila said. He said this debate should be encouraged as it is a way of creating an informed citizenry. He was speaking at University of Nairobu during the launch of the book Presidential or Parliamentary Democracy in Kenya authored by Governor Anyang' Nyong'o. Present were Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju, Siaya Senator James Orengo, Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi, ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna among others. Kiraitu said ethnicity is real and has become difficult to erase in Kenyan politics. He added that a presidential system does not provide a conducive environment to thrive. "A parliamentary system is more supporting to devolution. It is not about the personality but the institution of presidency. It enjoys so much myth and sucks oxygen from other institutions of governance," he added. Kiraitu further said there is little Kenyans can do if the President decides to ignore the Constitution with the current system. He said the Council of Governors is oppressed by financial imperialism. "Kenya is still a tribal society and it's time we accept it. Presidental elections are a tribal vote and a primary source of conflict." "Ethnicity becomes sharpened when we come to the presidential election," he said. Kiraitu noted that governors want a system where the President is the head of state and a Prime Minister who will be head of government.
