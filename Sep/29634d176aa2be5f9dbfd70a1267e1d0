Gospel singer Rose Muhando has released a song pouring her heart out to President Uhuru Kenyatta and heaping praise on Kenyans for their warm welcome and accepting her when she was sick. The song was shared on YouTube by her friend and fellow gospel musician Stephen Kasolo on Tuesday. "Thank you His Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta and all the Kenyans for the Love you showed me during my sickness in Kenya. Now am safe and ready to work for the Lord," Muhando wrote. In the song, she prays to God to open doors and make ways for Uhuru. "Kenyatta. Let your hands and your house be blessed. Let the open heavens profess blessings to you," she sings. She also asked Kenya to be protected forever and her borders secured. "You opened your arms wide and accepted me. Be blessed Kenya and all your current and future generations. I do not have anything worthy to repay you," the lyrics to her Swahili song read. The gospel artiste found shelter in Kenya throughout her ailment last year. This is her second song after featuring Ringtone Apoko in another song, 'Walionicheka (Those who mocked me)'.
