Dutch tycoon Tob Cohen's sister Gabrielle van Straten has arrived at the lawyers office for the opening of the will. She was accompanied by her brother Bernard Cohen and her husband Roy van Straten. However, the opening of the Will will be a private affair but they will address the media after. A letter signed by Kirundi & Co Advocates invited the widow's lawyer Philip Murgor to the reading at Kirundi Advocates' offices on the ninth floor of Bruce House on Standard Street in the CBD. Murgor said his client doubts the motive of the planned will reading because the confidentiality of the document had been impugned after the Star, citing a Dutch newspaper, published its contents on September 16. "It is evidence that the confidential nature of the will you claim to possess or any others for that matter has been severely compromised, to the extent that our client has instructed us to inform you that she does not wish to participate in any related process," the letter read. The Star had reported that Cohen, at the time estranged from his wife, had given his sister his Sh400 million Kitisuru villa.
