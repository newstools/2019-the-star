Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula said it is wrong to harass professors and vice chancellors on tribal grounds. He said many lecturers from Western Kenya have reported to him about  intimidation by some leaders. Wetang'ula spoke on Saturday while addressing mourners during the funeral of Prof Barasa Wangila in Kimilili constituency, Bungoma. The former Vice Chancellor of Masinde Muliro University died last month at the Aga Khan Hospital. "I object to what we see happening to our leading scholars, especially those from the Mulembe nation. They are being oppressed in other regions because of ethnicity," he said The Ford Kenya leader gave an example of Laban Ayiro in Eldoret when he was the acting Vice Chancellor of Moi University. "Some senators from a certain fought Teresa Akenga our very own daughter. They  brought a motion on the Senate floor against her, but I stood firm  and told them that I'm going to deal with them 'mundu khu mundu'" he said "I pursued the senators one by one and told them that if they touch Akenga, they will be touching  people from Mulembe and we will deal with them. They chickened out."
