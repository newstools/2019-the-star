 The National Youth Service should be transformed into a training institution to effectively deliver its mandate. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday asked NYS ned director general Matilda Pamela Aleyo to ensure the agency reclaims its position in national development by equipping youth with adequate skills to contribute to nation-building. Uhuru spoke at State House in Nairobi when he witnessed the swearing-in of Sakwa. She had been acting as the DG. The President congratulated Sakwa fr her appointment and expressed confidence she has what it takes to lead NYS. “You are a person with experience in management of public resources and also in public service and administration. I have confidence that you will deliver not only to the government but also to the people of Kenya," Uhuru said. The new boss signed the General Integrity Code and the Accountability Pledge committing herself to discharge her duties according to the law without fear or favour. Uhuru said NYS has in the past failed to deliver on its mandate due to challenges of integrity and weak leadership. He directed Sakwa to rebuild trust, confidence and faith of Kenyans in the institution. “I have never failed to believe in this organisation as an instrument of transformation of our young people,” Uhuru said. He said ongoing reforms at NYS, including the set up of the management council, are aimed at strengthening the institution to make it more accountable and transparent. Public Service CS Margaret Kobia, State House Chief of Staff Nzioka Waita and NYS Council chairman Lt. Gen (Rtd) Njuki Mwaniki were present.  edited by peter obuya
