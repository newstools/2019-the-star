A new book by the Centre for Human Rights and Policy Studies (Chrips) was recently launched at Villa-Rosa Kempinski. The book, 'Policing Protests in Kenya', examines issues relating to laws and institutions, as well as attitudes and cultures towards policing of demonstrations in the country. It presents critical analysis of the complexities surrounding protests in a country that has historically struggled with accountable and democratic policing. Kenya has a history of political violence and mistrust of the police by the public. Among those present at the launch were National Police Service director of corporate communications Charles Owino, Chrips executive director Mutuma Ruteere and Civil Society convenor Suba Churchill.
