The annual Safaricom Kisii Half Marathon will not be held this year with organisers opting to stage a 10km road race. Athletics Kenya (AK) Nyanza South chairman Peter Angwenyi said the event will be held in Kisii town on September 27 and Safaricom remains the main sponsor. “We decided to have a quality 10km road in line with AK road racing rules,” Angwenyi added. According to the rules, half marathon winners are supposed to pocket Sh500,000—a budget they do not have. He said to attract top runners, the winners of the 10km road race will receive Sh100,000—an amount granted to winners of last year's marathon. Besides the 10km, the South Nyanza boss said there will be a  special event for athletes aged 35 years and above. “We want to enrich the event by having the masters race, which will be held alongside the main event,” he added. Angwenyi added that athletes will pay a registration fee of Sh300 and the race will start and end at Gusii Stadium. “We are surveying the course but we want to avoid congestion in town. However, we are thinking of using the main highway for about 10 to 20 minutes,” he added. At the same time, plans are underway to hold the inaugural Kitutu Chache South 10km road race. Area MP Richard Onyonka said the event will be sponsored by the National Government CDF and will be held during the final of the annual constituency football tournament. Races for juniors and masters will also be held. “The sports team is consulting Athletics Kenya and we hope to have a very successful road race,” said the MP.
