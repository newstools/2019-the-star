West Pokot Senator Samuel Poghisio has raised concerns about Governor John Lonyangapuo frequent reshuffling of his cabinet. Poghisio said that reshuffling of the cabinet each financial year may affect service delivery in the county. The remarks come two weeks after Governor Lonyangapuo reorganised his cabinet for the second time in two years. In the changes on September 4, only two executives Joel Ngasia (Agriculture, Irrigation and Pastoral Economy) and Geoffrey Lipale (Health) retained their positions. “Functions of the executive are clearly stipulated. Why move them each year when funds are released,” he asked. Poghisio said there was a need for better management of the cabinet rotations. “I'm not opposed to reshuffling because even the national government does it. But it doesn’t move the whole cabinet. The reorganisation should only affect a part of the cabinet,” he said. I'm carrying out an analysis to see that those who were moved in the recent reshuffling are competent to hold the various offices, Poghisio said. Governor Lonyangapuo has dismissed the concerns saying, “such words cannot come from a leader who knows how the government works”. (edited by O. Owino)
