Residents of Kawuoche village in Karachuonyo constituency were shocked after the body of a 50-year-old man was exhumed by order of the court. The body of George Okoth was exhumed under police watch after his wife sought a court order to bury him at their matrimonial home in Kanyamwa in Ndhiwa constituency. Wrangles had surrounded the funeral after the wife and Okoth's family differed over the burial place. Okoth’s wife wanted him buried in Kanyamwa, while the family wanted it done in Karachuonyo, his ancestral land. Speaking to journalists on Sunday, Kobuya chief Damianus Osano said the deceased bought land and built his family home in Ndhiwa. Osano said Okoth who worked in Kitale, Trans Nzoia county fell ill after building the home. On Tuesday last week, Okoth’s brothers hijacked his body from a Kitale mortuary, ferried it to Karachuonyo and buried it the following day. “They rushed and buried the body on Wednesday at around 5am. Okoth’s wife was blocked from accessing home,” Osano said. The administrator said the controversial burial prompted Okoth’s wife to seek court intervention. On Saturday, the chief said they were forced to exhume the body that had been in the grave for three days. “Police officers from Kendu Bay retrieved the body from the grave following a court order,” he said. On Sunday, Osano said some residents and family members who objected to the Ndhiwa burial engaged police in running battles. “The officers managed to disperse the protesters after lobbing teargases at them,” Osano said. The body was taken to Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary. “We’re waiting for the court to give direction on where the body would be buried,” the administrator said. (edited by O.
