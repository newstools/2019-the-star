The Vihiga government has denied reports a female patient who died at the county referral hospital was neglected by medics. Health executive Amos Kutwa on Monday said the video that has gone viral on social media showing Annette Kabarika groaning in pain was not shot at the referral hospital but from a private facility. Kutwa said Kabarika was admitted at Vihiga County Referral Hospital on September 14 after being hit by a motorbike. "She died on September 16 when her stabilising condition suddenly changed." "Annette was brought in on Saturday at 9pm by well-wishers from Digital Medical Centre in Chavakali, a victim of a motorbike accident and all the necessary medical procedures were done on her,” the CEC said. Kabarika’s mother Robai Adisa claimed that her daughter died out of negligence by medical staff at the referral hospital. She claimed she stayed at the facility for 30 hours with her daughter without being attended to. “She cried bitterly until her last minute for the doctors to help her. My daughter died because I didn’t have money,” Adisa said. Doctors demanded Sh4,500 before Kabarika could be assisted, she said, adding that the medics declined to accept the Sh2,500 she raised. But Kutwa discounted the claims saying X-ray scans done on Kabarika revealed she had a fractured left thigh bone. She also had cuts which were stitched, Kutwa said. X-ray scans were sound enough for a medical diagnostic conclusion thus a CT scan was deemed not an emergency at that point, he said. He dismissed as far-fetched, misguiding and inflammatory, claims by the deceased's mother that Kabarika was denied CT scan services for failing to raise Sh4,500. Before her death, she had been slated for surgery at the referral hospital. Edited by R.Wamochie
