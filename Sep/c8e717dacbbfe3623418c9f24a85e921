Three student leaders of Multimedia University have been arrested for leading a protest against reckless driving by matatu drivers on Magadi Road. The three, students' chairperson Nimo Sheikh, secretary-general Steve Ogola and academic secretary Jillo were arrested after police officers were dispatched to contain the strike. The students had earlier on Monday morning barricaded part of Magadi Road after one of their own died after a hit-and-run incident. A first-year student at the institution was last week reportedly hit by a speeding matatu, leading to uproar from the general student body. The student is currently receiving treatment at the Kenyatta National Hospital’s (KNH) Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Accidents linked to student deaths at the university have hit headlines in the last five years with the students taking to the roads on at least two occasions. In 2016, the students blocked the roads to protest the killing of one of the students who perished in a road accident. The students were protesting the death of their colleague who was one of the four passengers killed in the Lang’ata Road carnage. That same year, a fourth-year student at the institution was knocked down by a construction vehicle at the campus compound and reportedly died while being rushed to the hospital. Last year, Multimedia  University was thrown into mourning again after it lost a  student leader to a grisly road accident which took place along the Nairobi Southern Bypass. Ronald Kiprono Kirui also known as Yusuf was travelling from Nakuru to Rongai together with two others when their vehicle lost control and veered off the road killing the then students secretary general on the spot.
