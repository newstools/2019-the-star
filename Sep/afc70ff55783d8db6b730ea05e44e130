Raheem Sterling has ditched the PR firm which leaked news that he was to captain England on his 50th cap. The Manchester City star was ‘fuming’ after Purple PR sent out a press release stating Sterling would skipper Gareth Southgate’s side against Holland in the Uefa Nations League in June. Sterling spoke to England boss Southgate to reassure him that the story was leaked without his consent. Sterling and his representatives are looking at alternative arrangements, just as sponsors are lining up to land Sterling’s signature, with Puma making him their No 1 target this season with a mega-money offer. Bjorn Gulden, the German sportswear giant’s chief executive, made it clear how valuable signing Sterling would be at the launch of their flagship store in New York last week. The England international is in the final year of a boot contract with rivals Nike, and other major manufacturers, including Adidas, are scrambling for his signature. Puma recently began a 10-year kit deal with City worth up to £650m (Sh80.7bn), and they hope their close ties with the English champions could sway the 24-year-old’s decision in their favour. Pep Guardiola signed a long-term personal endorsement contract with Puma in July, while Sergio Aguero and David Silva are also linked with the kit maker. Last season, Sterling was rewarded with a three-year contract extension at City, worth up to £300,000 (Sh37m) a week. He has scored six goals in five games already this campaign after netting 31 times for club and country last year. Sterling’s marketing profile continues to soar, especially after he has spoken out on how black players are treated. Nike launched a viral campaign with Sterling last season shortly after he was subjected to racist abuse during a match at Chelsea. A picture of Sterling was accompanied with the message: “Speaking up doesn’t always make like easier. But easy never changed anything.”
