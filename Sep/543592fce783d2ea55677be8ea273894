Wazito captain Dennis Gicheru has reiterated his commitment to multi-task after the club elevated him to the rank of chief executive officer yesterday. The centre-half, who is currently on rehabilitation after going under the knife following a knee injury suffered last season, will work closely with sporting director Solomon Alubala. Gicheru played an integral part in Wazito’s automatic promotion to the top flight last season but was unfortunate to pick a nasty injury in the final rounds which is expected to keep him out of action for long. The league returnees, who began life in the elite league with a one-all draw against Nzoia Sugar, opted for the youthful player to fill in the void left by Luther Mokua last year. The club rung administrative changes after it’s acquisition by Swedish billionaire Ricardo Badoer last year with Alubala chairing the board and single-handedly running the show. Gicheru, who is anticipating to be admitted to the bar next year after wrapping up his internship in the field of law, welcomed his elevation to the new role. “I am elated to have been given additional responsibilities in the club. I am looking to team up with the rest of the guys in running the club to achieve our objectives. I am still the captain of the club and I am ready to multi-task. Alubala was a little bit overwhelmed by the administration and I am looking to aid him and fill in the place left by Mokua'" he noted The former KCB player who was also part of the KCB team which gained promotion last year said he was not under pressure to juggle between the two. He ruled out hanging his boots to concentrate on his legal career and the new role at the club.
