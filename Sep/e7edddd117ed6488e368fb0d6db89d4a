Kisumu MCAs risk being evicted from Mega Plaza premises over more than Sh13.5 million rent arrears and service charges. This is according to a June 30 letter seen by the Star addressed to the assembly clerk in which Wasuna and Company advocates said they may be constrained to institute legal processes to recover the money. Last year on July 9, the assembly was given exclusive vacant possession of the entire leased space on 9th, 10th and 11th floors of the premises by Shiloah Investment Limited. The assembly is yet to official occupy the offices but only attended some meetings a few times this year during the budget process. The letter further stated that the amount continues to attract interest at two per cent for late payment until the debt is settled. It further reads, “Unless the county assembly pays the amount and also vacates within 30 days of the date delivery of this letter, our client will be constrained to institute legal proceedings for recovery of the rent arrears.” When contacted, acting speaker Eisha Oraro they have seen the letter and received another notice giving them seven days to clear the arrears or be auctioned. Oraro said they responded asking for more time to study the engagement between the group and the assembly due to the current change office and leadership. He noted that they were surprised because they assembly received money for 2018-19 and asked where the arrears came from and why they had not been paid. “It’s very unfortunate that this had to occur but we have also engaged legal minds to look at the matter and various terms of the agreement,” Oraro told the Star on phone. The Shiloah Investment Limited agreed to lease the offices at Sh829,733 per month from last year on July 1. This would go up to Sh912,706 per month from July 1, 2019, exclusive of service charge. According to the letter, the service charge payable is Sh204,750 per month from last July but will escalate to Sh225,225 per month after a year. Edited by R.Wamochie
