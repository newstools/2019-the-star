Residents of Kanamkemer ward in Turkana will benefit from Sh72 million water project, Governor Josphat Nanok has said. The Napuu water project is expected to be completed in three months and will serve more than 25,000 residents. The Turkana government in collaboration with the National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority signed an MoU to ensure Napuu water project is completed to benefit residents who have been struggling to access clean water for domestic use and irrigation. Turkana has underground water aquifers at Lotikipi Plains and Napuu in Turkana West and Turkana Central, respectively. The highest population in the county depends on borehole water. The project will include the installation of an elevated 3,000 litres of water steel tank in Narewa, which will supply water to Narewa, Lokitela, Ekaales, Masewan, Kasarani, Juluk and Trans Africa villages. It will also supply institutions such as Kisumu Polytechnic and Turkana University College. "The government will utilise water from boreholes in the Napuu aquifer to support the development of Lodwar Municipality and expansion of existing irrigation schemes. Itâ€™s going to improve development in Lodwar town," the county chief said. Former Kajiado Governor David Nkedianye, the chairman of the National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority, said Napuu water project will cost Sh72 million. "We have to look at the potential of Napuu water aquifers and boreholes that can produce a lot of water. We are partnering with the Turkana government to put an elevated tank that will serve residents, institutions and private investors in Lodwar," he said.
