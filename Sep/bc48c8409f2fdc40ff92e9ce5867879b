Nairobi Woman Rep Esther Passaris has gone through a successful surgery at Aga Khan hospital in Nairobi. Passaris was admitted on Monday after having a problem with her back for almost two decades. She went through a Medial Branch Block procedure. Passaris through a tweet on Tuesday said it was her first time to spend a pain-free night. "Thank God my operation went well. I had my first pain-free night in over two months," Passaris said adding that she is starting her physiotherapy today to get fit after the operation. She thanked Kenyans for supporting her through prayers and wishing her well. Passaris went through thyroidectomy surgery to remove her goiter in February, which involves surgical removal of all or part of the thyroid gland. She was admitted on January 5 for removal of her two thyroid glands. She said that she kept details of her survey confidential until she knew she was out of danger.
