Youth and Gender Affairs CAS Rachael Shebesh has been criticised by Jubilee Rift politicians for saying President Uhuru Kenyatta did not endorse ex-footballer McDonald Mariga for Kibra MP. In a widely circulated video clip, Shebesh is heard saying that Uhuru never endorsed Mariga for Kibra MP in the by-election. She said a few individuals Jubilee fronting Mariga sneaked him through the backdoor into State House and forced Uhuru into accepting to pose for a photo with him. The politicians said on Saturday that Shebesh's remark amounts to misconduct and disrespect to the party and they want her to resign. They were speaking at Chemaner in Bomet East during a fundraiser for a businessman whose property was razed by fire Led by Bomet Woman Representative Joyce Korir, Bomet East MP Beatrice Kones and Senator Christopher Langat, they told Shebesh she was holder her position thanks to Jubilee. Therefore, she should toe the line and stop campaigning against the party's agenda, they said. They said Jubilee was not formed by one individual but by President Kenyatta and DP William Ruto. "Jubilee belongs to us all...we respect Uhuru as the party leader and Ruto as the deputy party leader so she should respect both equally," Korir said. She said the handshake between Uhuru and ODM's Raila Odinga did not meet Jubilee and ODM had merged. "This is the reason we haveÂ  Jubilee and ODM candidates separately vying for the Kibra seat and which Uhuru and Ruto have endorsed." "She should stop being stupid and know she is where she is now because of us in Jubilee," Korir said. Langat echoed the sentiment referring to Shebesh as a "confused woman" (Edited by V. Graham)
