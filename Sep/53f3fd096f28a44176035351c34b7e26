Kenya Lionesses face an easy pool in the Olympic qualifiers when they face Senegal, Botswana, Ghana in Tunisia next month. Kenya, who are the Africa Sevens champions will start their campaign against Ghana in Pool 'A', followed by Botswana and wind up their preliminary assignments against Senegal. Pool 'B' will see powerhouses, South Africa, battle it out against Uganda, ZambiaÂ  and Zimbabwe. Hosts Tunisia headline Pool 'C' and will renew rivalry with Madagascar, Morocco, and Mauritius. Kenya will be seeking to make a direct entry to the Olympics by winning the tournament, the only guarantee at this stage. The silver and bronze medalists will have another opportunity to qualify in a world repechage tournament where they will compete against teams from other regions. Kenya played at the Rio Olympics in 2016 after South Africa withdrew from the tournament after the South African Olympic Association said they had no hope of medalling at the contest. The Lionesses had a disastrous showing at the Rio Games, losing all three matches in the preliminary stage including a 52-0 whitewash by New Zealand, 40-7 loss to France and 19-10 to Spain. Kenya then lost 24-0 to Japan in the classification match to determine positions 9-12 to drop down to the 11-12 place playoff match where they beat Colombia 22-10.
