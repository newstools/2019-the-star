Arsenal head coach Unai Emery has named midfielder Granit Xhaka as the club’s new permanent captain. Emery informed the squad of his decision this morning, ahead of Monday’s trip to face Manchester United at Old Trafford. Xhaka has led the side in six of their eight games in all competitions this season - but Emery was yet to make final decision. Emery consulted with the players before relaying the news that Xhaka will take the armband on a full-time basis. The Swiss international turned 27 today and succeeds Laurent Koscielny, who left Arsenal for Bordeaux in the summer. Emery is still deliberating over a vice-captain, with forwards Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang understood to be the leading contenders.
