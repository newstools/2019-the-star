Jubilee Celebrations Centre pastor Kathy Kiuna has asked single mothers to cling to God and seek His wisdom and His provision. In a moving post on Instagram, the servant of God reminds her followers that as difficult as it may be, there is nothing too difficult for our God. "To my single mamas: Being a single mother is hard when you’re trying to meet the emotional, spiritual and physical needs of your children, all while you’re trying to meet those same needs for yourself," she wrote. "Between a career, the child (children) extracurricular activities, making dinner, paying bills, sometimes it’s easy to get lost in everything else that we forget ourselves." She finishes off by reminding them that God will lead them to the man that will love them and their baby/babies just as He led her to her hubby Bishop Kiuna.
