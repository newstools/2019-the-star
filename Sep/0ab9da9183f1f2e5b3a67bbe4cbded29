The untimely death of eight pupils of Precious Talent Academy in Nairobi prompted the government to order an audit of all schools, something that should have been done before the tragedy to save lives. Lives were lost in the recent drought spell in Baringo and Turkana;Â  were there no funds set aside to counteract drought in marginalised areas? The government seems to only act the moment they see casualties. For a building to collapse without reason means it was constructed under illegal circumstances, implicating officials of government tasked with ensuring safe construction. Some of these officials accept bribes from landowners to turn away from a development that should not be erected on that land depending on size and population expected to live there. Government officials should set their priorities straight to avoid try-to-convince speeches whenever a disaster has occurred. Egerton University
