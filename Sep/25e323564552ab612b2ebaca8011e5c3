Migori Governor Okoth Obado on Wednesday launched Sh43.8 million agriculture project to boost food security. The first phase will cost Sh22 million. It will directly benefit groups of small-scale farmers and is carried out in partnership with the National Agricultural and Rural Inclusive Growth Project (NAGRIP) with the support of the World Bank. The NAGRIP project began in 2016. It will be implemented by 21 counties and run for the next eight years. It is aimed at increasing agricultural output in rural areas. Issuing cheques to beneficiaries, Obado said the project will be in line with the Big Four Agenda that is championed by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The project covers six subcounties — Rongo, Uriri, Suna West, Kuria West and Nyatike.  Awendo and Suna East are expected to benefit in the second phase. “We will be the next regional breadbasket as there will be surplus production from our farmers if the funds are put to proper use,” he said. “Our youths mainly focus on white-collar employment leaving behind immense potential that lies in Agriculture. Let them draft proposals to benefit from this newfound initiative.” Obado urged the beneficiaries to use the funds wisely. The project will enhance productivity and improved value chain in the region, he said. Migori Agriculture executive Valentine Ogongo said the county is focused on improving the welfare of small-scale farmers to boost their income. (Edited by F'Orieny)
