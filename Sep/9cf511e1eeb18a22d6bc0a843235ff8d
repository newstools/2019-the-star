AFC Leopards and Kariobangi Sharks extended their winless streak in the 2018-2019 Kenya Premier League after settling for a barren draw at the Moi Stadium Kasarani. Leopardsâ€™ goalkeeper Benjamin Ochan produced superb first-half saves to deny the marauding Sharks forwards who were in search for early goals. The former champions struggled to string passes together and wreak havoc in Sharks area and would break for the breather without testing Brian Bwire who was preferred for the match ahead of first-choice goalkeeper John Oyemba. After the break Ingwe coach Andre Mbungo made double changes introducing the duo of Hansel Ochieng and Austin Odhiambo for John Wonder and Ismailia Diarra. The two breathed life to Leopards attacking line as well as the game as both teams traded attacks in a desperate search for goals. Sharks right back Erick Juma who was tasked with marking Paul Were was rested for Sydney Lokale while Patrick Otieno paved way for Daniel Sakari. Leopards new striker Mark Makwatta thought he had broken the deadlock in the 69th minute but centre referee Yassin Badir ruled it our for offside. Search for a match-winning goal by the two sides proved futile at the stroke of ninety minutes.
