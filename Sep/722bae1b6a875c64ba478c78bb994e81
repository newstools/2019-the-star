Wajir Woman MP Fatuma Gedi has challenged Jubilee's decision to crown former Harambee Stars player McDonald Mariga as their flag bearer for the Kibra by-election. Mariga was vetted by National Elections Board at the party's headquarters on September 2. "The Jubilee nominations were not democratic at all. We wanted a free and fair process. They should have allowed people to vote. ODM was more democratic,"Gedi said in an interview with JKL on Wednesday night. Gedi said Mariga had not done any projects in Kibra adding that he earned sh 24 million a month when he was a footballer. "I was surprised when he was asked what he will do for Kibra residents then he said he wants to give back to the community. He earned sh 6 million per week yet he has no single project in Kibra,"she posed. She said Mariga cannot be a role model as he is known for betting adding that she cannot support him. "On Mariga, my conscience cannot allow me to support him. When you put on the TV, all you see is the candidate promoting betting, which is not good for kids," Gedi said. Gedi said Kibra parliamentary seat competition is about ODM'S candidate Imran Okoth and Ford Kenya's candidate Khamisi Butichi. President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto on Wednesday last week assured Mariga of support. They met the former Harambee Stars player at State House and vowed to fully rally behind him in the race. This comes a day afterÂ Nairobi County Speaker Beatrice Elachi opposed Mariga's candidature in the November 7 Kibra by-election. Elachi who is also a member of the ruling party said Mariga cannot fit into the shoes of the late MP Ken Okoth. Mariga will now face off with other 23 candidates who have been cleared by IEBC. They include Imran Okoth of ODM, Eliud Owallo of ANC and Khamisi Butichi of Ford Kenya, among others. The Kibra parliamentary seat fell vacant after former MP Ken Okoth succumbed to cancer.
