Two suspects in last week’s Equity Bank Moyale Sh42 Million heist have been remanded in custody for 10 days to enable police complete investigations. Roba Diba Boru, Branch Operation Manager of Equity Bank Moyale and Langat Kipngetich Nelson, a Wells Fargo Security Company employee, were arraigned on Monday. In an affidavit filed in court, special crimes unit say the two were initially arrested by the DCI Moyale and then released but they were later rearrested and escorted to Nairobi upon fresh evidence indicating that they were linked to the disappearance of Sh42 Million belonging to Equity Bank Moyale. According to police, Boru as the operations manager had been duly informed of the arrival of the money in question and was on duty duly at the material time while Kipngetich who is a cash counting officer was duly assigned to escort the money in question. However, upon arrival at the OODA Airstrip Moyale, it is alleged that three armed persons emerged and moved the money in question while using motorbikes ordering all of them to lie down including the pilot. “Preliminary investigations reveal that the two were aware of the regulations and security standards to be governed to have directed the pilot not to land at the airstrip at that time because no proper security measures had been put in place,” the affidavit reads in part.
