The 2019/2020 Football Kenya Federation (FKF) western branch league has been split into two zones in order to reduce the heavy burden of travelling long distances during away matches. The branch, which comprises of Vihiga, Kakamega and Busia counties will see teams from Kakamega and Vihiga form Zone 'A' while Zone 'B' will feature teams from Butere, Mumias and Busia sub-branches. Addressing club's officials in Kakamega, the branch chairman Moses Akali said they have successfully managed to bring together all warring factions to have a unified league. "Many teams have suffered so much in the past in as far as the logistics involved in away matches are concerned. This is why we have decided to split it into two in in a bid to reduce the burden. "The league has been very much competitive and we want to believe this season will be more entertaining," he added. Kelvin Mwangu, who is the branch secretary-general called upon the teams to put the right structures in place in order to attract sponsorship. "We need to improve our youth structures and women football in order for us to move forward with other regions," he added.
