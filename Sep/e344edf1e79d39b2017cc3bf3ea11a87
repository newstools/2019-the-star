A lawyer for the Nigerian political activist Omoyele Sowore, who has been in detention for more than seven weeks, says he is still trying to secure his client's release hours after a court in the capital, Abuja, ordered he be immediately freed. Sowore, who did not appear at Tuesday's hearing, is facing charges of treason, money laundering and insulting the president. He publishes the online newspaper Sahara Reporters and was a candidate in the last presidential election. The 48-year-old was arrested in early August for trying to organise nationwide anti-government street protests under the slogan and hashtag #RevolutionNow. President Muhammadu Buhari's administration is facing criticism for its human rights record especially following a brutal campaign against Shia protesters.
