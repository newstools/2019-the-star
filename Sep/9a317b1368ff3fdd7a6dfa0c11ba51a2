Muthaiga Golf Club has rolled out a new drive that focuses on training and nurturing primary school kids to embrace golf. The move is aimed at growing the quality of golf standards among juniors in the country with an aim of catapulting them to the international stage. The Initiative dubbed ‘Fadhili Drive’ has seen the club kick-off with 10 promising pupils from Muthaiga Primary School. The kids will be enrolled for continuous training until they finish their primary school level and selection process is done by the School and not the club. “We intend to invest heavily in this project to ensure the future golf generation is well nurtured. We want every child who loves golf to know that, our golf club is open to nurture and grow talent thus giving them an opportunity to become some of the best golfers,” said Ronald Meru, marketing & communication director at Muthaiga Golf Club. The club is already providing these kids with free golf lessons and has provided them with golf kit. Meru said they started with Muthaiga Primary in Nairobi and will soon be rolling the programme to other schools across the country.
