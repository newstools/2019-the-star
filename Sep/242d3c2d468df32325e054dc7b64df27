In a partnership with local top music & entertainment platforms including Boomplay & Vskit, the competition’s mission is to select & support the potential stars among the students with great musical talent. “Most Kenyans are born talented in art, especially singing & dancing, but they lack the best suitable platforms to express their amazing talents & show to the world. The company, as a bold & stylish brand with the spirit "The Future is Now", has been creating this dream stage & offering opportunities to Kenyan university students, who represent the future," said Mr. Qiang the Brand Manager Infinix Kenya. For those candidates that entered the finals the company  will sponsor them a chance, at getting professional vocal training through its partnership with Boomplay, to further enhance their singing skills and nurture their overall stage image into next level. If one happens to search for the hashtag #InfinixBeatYaCampo on Instagram or Vskit, you could simply view the finalist videos & vote for your favorite candidate. At the final competition tomorrow, the winner will win incredible prizes, including the company’s latest smartphone, Sh 10,000 in cash, 50% coupon from infinixmall, a hamper from Boomplay and many more prizes. More surprises, for those attending the "Singing Concert" at Kenyatta University, will be lucky draws with amazing gifts during the event, including the latest Infinix Hot 8. The event starts from 3PM and ends at 10PM. Amazing performances from Bensoul of Sol Generation and Nadia Mukami will be expected.
