Some of the finest attention-grabbing cars and motorcycles among them six MG’s are set to be on show when the 49th edition of CBA Africa Concours d’Elegance is held next weekend at the Nairobi Racecourse. The annual series held by the Alfa Romeo Owners Club will reward the owners of well-prepared classic and vintage cars and motorcycles and celebrate the club’s anniversary. The star among the group of MG sports cars is the 1947 MG TC of Sati Gata Aura. Last year he finished second overall only one point adrift of Veronica Wroe’s 1934 Rolls Royce Boatail which captured the winner’s trophy. Veronica will be defending her title on September 29th. Aura’s rivals include an unknown quantity in the shape of a 1937 MG TA entered by newcomer Paras Shah. Another rival is the MGA of Athi River-based motor enthusiast Stuart Allison who won the Concours in 2015. The Sportscar class will also be contested by the Uganda entry of Kakooza Wazzir who will be driving his 1984 Panther Kallista on the Total Excellium judging ramp and along the line in front of the racecourse grandstands. Other contenders include the Vitafoam MGB and a 1961 MGA owned by David Filmer who is making his debut appearance at the racecourse. Rivalry in the prestigious class for Pre-1940 cars has been heightened by the arrival of Paras Shah’s 1937 MG TA, the 1928 Ford model A of Ngatia Executives and the impressive Mercedes 230 SLs of Sachit Shah and Andrew Smith. There are awards for the top three overall machines and prizes in the 12 car and eight motorcycle classics.
