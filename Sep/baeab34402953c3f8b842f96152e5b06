Harambee Stars have rallied from a goal down to settle for a one all draw against Uganda Cranes in a friendly match played at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Stars’ goalkeeper Patrick Matasi produced fine saves in the early minutes of the match to deny Khalid Aucho and Emmanuel Okwi who showed intentions of giving the visitors an early lead. Aucho, a league winning player with Gor Mahia in 2015, was in a class of his own where he bossed the midfield and nearly shot Uganda ahead in the ninth minute but his long range shot ended in Matasi’s hands. Uganda capitalised on Stars nervous start and broke the deadlock in the 23rd minute through Okwi who dribbled past his markers to slot the ball past an hapless Matasi. Stars coach Francis Kimanzi effected the first change with three minutes to the breather withdrawing debutant Collins Agade who had a caution against his name for Whyvonne Isuza. Kimanzi made his second change after the break introducing Johnstone Omurwa for Michael Kibwage’s in a bid to stabilize the shaky defence. A ferocious run by Erick ‘Marcelo’ Ouma in the 50th minute cracked the Ugandan defence with the speedy defence releasing Ayub Timbe who picked Kenneth Muguna in the box. The Gor captain slotted the ball past the line to register his first ever international goal. Stars stepped up their quest for the second goal inflicting panic to the visitors who resorted to drop deep to their half to defend. The much-needed goal did not come forth in favor of the hosts who are expected to face Libya or Mozambique next month in another test match.
