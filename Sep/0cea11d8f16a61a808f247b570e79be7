Three new men teams will be in action as the new season of the Kenya Handball Federation national League gets underway tomorrow at the Kaloleni grounds. Inspired Boys, Buccaneers and Warriors are the new entrants as they try to challenge champions National Cereals and Produce Board, who start their title defence against National Youth Service. In the other matches, former champions Black Mamba battle Generation, Boomerang take on Technical University of Kenya as   Jomo Kenyatta University Agricultural Technology (JKUAT) welcome newcomers  Inspired Boys in the last match of the day. On Sunday, NYS take on JKUAT, Generation square it out with Warriors as Boomerang play Buccaneers. Inspired Boys will return to the courts with a tie against Black Mamba. NCPB women’s team begin their title campaign against NYS. KHF fixture secretary Charles Omondi said he expects more new teams to join the league in the coming days. “We needed to start the new season this weekend because we realised we were running behind time, which is not a good thing. At least five teams have indicated their interest in joining the league and we are glad so far three have confirmed their participation,” said Omondi. “More teams coming on board means there will be good competition in the league which we have always advocated for. The door is still open for other teams aspiring to be part of the league.” The official also noted that plans are underway to converge the national men’s team to start training ahead of next year’s Africa Cup of Nation cum-Olympic qualifier in Tunisia.
