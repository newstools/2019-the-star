Kenya’s bid for the UN Security Council seat got a boost on Tuesday after incoming envoys promised to support it. The envoys made the pledge at State House, Nairobi, when President Uhuru Kenyatta received credentials from 11 new envoys. Among the new envoys is the United Kingdom High Commissioner  Jane Marriott and the new European Union Delegation Ambassador to Kenya, Simon Mordue Other envoys included Dimitrios Zavoritis (Greece),  Winpeg Moyo (Zimbabwe), Saqtain Syedah (Pakistan) and Martin Klepetko (Czech Republic), Ambassador Oded Joseph of Israel and Jean Bosco Barege of Burundi. Uhuru received credentials  from three non-permanent envoys: Toba Sebade from Togo, Sulayman Aliu from Gambia and Hermann Immongault from Gabon. “I could not finish, Your Excellency, without expressing appreciation for the support Kenya has offered to Greece,"  Zavoritis said. Moyo said her nation supports Kenya’s bid for the non-permanent seat and hopes Kenya will win. The new UK High Commissioner said," I would also like to pay our respects to the continued commitment and sacrifice of your security and defence forces and society leaders who fight against extremism and terrorism.” “Stand as two vibrant and modern countries, crucial to the success of our respective regions and with important roles in the commonwealth and in supporting the rules-based international system." The EU envoy said that the European countries regard Kenya as having the economic and political weight to make a decisive contribution to stability in the region. He also said Kenya’s commitment to regional stability is proven by its contribution to AMISOM and the hosting of more than 475,000 refugees. Uhuru welcomed the new envoys to Nairobi and urged them to work closely with his administration for the mutual benefit of Kenya and the countries they represent. "I am looking forward to working with each one of the new diplomats in deepening bilateral ties between Kenya and their respective countries," Uhuru said.
