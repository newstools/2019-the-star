Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has said there are loopholes in Ekuru Aukot's push for constitutional amendment. He said in 2015, he advocated for reduction of the cost of representation in Parliament. “But if I look at the Punguza Mizigo initiative, I see some mistakes which are unworkable. When I met Aukot and pointed out the mistakes and tried to talk him out so that we could improvise a few issues, he does not want that. You cannot carry this country all alone; it belongs to all of us,” Kuria said. He accused the Thirdway Alliance party leader of not having good intentions for the country. "He does not want to dialogue with other leaders in his referendum push." He said the bill is a non-starter and will fail miserably. The lawmaker cited Lamu county which has two constituencies and about 100,000 voters. "You cannot give them one man and one woman MP and give Meru county, which has nine constituencies, the same number," Kuria said. He spoke to journalists in Meru on Sunday before attending an album launch for Meru gospel artist Makena Wamatiri at Maua Stadium in Igembe South constituency. Kuria said BBI is not a constitutional amendment but a task force that will give a report of their findings. “There is a very clear report of how you change the Constitution and if they recommend it, then due process will be followed through Parliament or popular initiative,” he said. The Building Bridges Initiative should be given a chance rather than being slammed even before being tabled, he said. Kuria urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to receive the findings in Kasarani where Kenyans will be in attendance "for it to be seen as an initiative for all Kenyans". The lawmaker urged governors to endorse BBI, saying any efforts that can improve the country should be supported. Kuria said he does not want to campaign for 2022 despite earlier declaring his bid. "I want to put my ambition and focus on development and others seeking the presidency should do the same." Edited by R.Wamochie
