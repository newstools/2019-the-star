Kibabii University dominated the Kenya Universities Sports Association Western Conference,  running away with the overall athletics title as the two-day championships ended at Kisii University yesterday. Kibabii garnered 190 points to beat six other universities to the title. Kabianga University was second with 179 points with hosts Kisii finishing third with 139 points. Last year’s winners Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology did not defend the title. The institution was closed last week due to students’ unrest. Kisii won the men’s category with 108 points with Kabianga trailing closely with 94 points. Kibabii came third with 82 points. Kibabii settled for the women’s category title with 108 points, beating Kabianga to second with 85 points while Rongo was third with 64 points. Sharon Chebet stole the show during the two-day championships,  winning the 400m hurdles, 400m, 800m, 1, 500m and 3, 000m events. She also guided her team to victory in the 4x100m and 4x400m relays. “The competition was not very stiff and that is why I decided to take part in a number of events. I also wanted to use this event to build my endurance because next year, I want to try and represent the country at international events,” added Chebet. Kisii University wrestled the men’s tug of war title from last year’s winners Kibabii. However, Kibabii beat Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology to lift the women’s crown. Kisii also reigned supreme in scrabble, winning the women’s title while the men’s title went to Rongo University with Jaramogi Oginga Odinga finishing second and Kisii third. Kabianga won the women’s chess title, beating Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University to second place. Jaramogi, however, settled for the men’s title after edging out Kisii University. Ends
