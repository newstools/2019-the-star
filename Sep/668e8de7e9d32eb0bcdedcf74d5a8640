Radio Jambo’s DJ Eunice Wanjiku, popularly known as DJ Nyc, says being seen as a threat by male DJs is her biggest challenge. Nyc says her childhood dream was to be on radio but she joined campus to study public health. In an interview with Word Is, she said “I went to do public health and the first assignment was in a morgue, which was not my thing. That pressure made me like the DJ part more.” Nyc called her dad and told him that she wanted to be on radio and the only way was by her becoming a DJ. “At first he stopped me but I convinced him, and he paid my fees after I promised to finish my public health course,” she said. Nyc juggled between the course and deejaying and after four years she graduated with a degree in public health. “I have never used the degree anywhere and my mum still thinks I’m jobless.” The journey of being a DJ has not been easy. “There is discrimination in the industry as some male DJs see you as a threat and try to fight you while others want to [sleep with you] to give you gigs,” she said. It’s not easy to find a date as men fear going out with female DJs because the nature of the job requires them to work at night and in clubs. Working with Mbusi and Lion is one of the best things that keeps her going. “They are the best duo to work with and through them, I am now known and they have been helping me get gigs,” Nyc said. Her message to other female DJs is, “it won’t be easy at the start, but focusing on what you want to achieve is the key.”
