Sadio Mane has revealed he spoke to Mohamed Salah ‘face to face’ after his angry outburst during Liverpool’s victory over Burnley. Mane scored in the 3-0 win at Turf Moor two weeks ago but reacted angrily after Salah chose to shoot rather than pass to him during a promising attack late in the game. The Senegal international was substituted in the closing stages and proceeded to shout and throw his training jacket to the floor as he took his place on the bench. Initially, it appeared that Mane was unhappy with being replaced but it transpired he was in fact furious at Salah’s perceived selfishness. The 27-year-old was quizzed about the incident after Liverpool continued their fine start to the season with a 3-1 win over Newcastle on Saturday and revealed the pair have now buried the hatchet. “With Salah? It’s forgotten,” Mane said. “These are things that happen in football. Sometimes you have to say things face to face. Sometimes it happens that I am not given the pass.” “But we have reconciled and become the good friends we were before.” Mane scored twice in Saturday’s victory meaning he’s now found the back of the net six times in six games this season.
