The National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority established under the Water Act 2016 should introduce a policy where commercial and residential buildings will be required to have necessary equipment of harvesting water. Rainwater will ease payment of bills as well as be utilised for domestic uses such as cooking and cleaning. Fast flash, surface runoff harvesting among other methods can be used to harvest rainwater. The public should also be sensitised on the value of rainwater especially at a time when the country is at risk of critical shortage. Delay of the long rains which led to exposure of some areas to drought should be enough incentive to prompt Kenyans into action. Harvesting water will also reduce the effects of rationing as households will still have enough.  Mombasa
