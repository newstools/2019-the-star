 Elected leaders in Vihiga county should stop witch-hunting against each other and instead focus on development. County secretary Francis Ominde on Tuesday said the leaders' key role is to transform lives of residents and not engaging in unnecessary political contests. He spoke during a show on Anyole FM in Emuhaya. Ominde is among those said to be eying the governorship in 2022. He said the county needs leaders with vision to prosper. The embattled official accused the county leadership of failing to tackle poverty which he said is largely to blame for residents lack of empowerment. "It is the duty of the elected leaders to help the electorates out of poverty. The leaders should be in the front-line in empowering their people economically,‚Äù Ominde said.  edited by peter obuya
