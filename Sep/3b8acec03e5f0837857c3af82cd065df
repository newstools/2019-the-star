Kiyeng alongside compatriots Celliphine Chespol who is the reigning World U-20 champion and record holder Beatrice Chepkoech qualified for the finals during the heats held on Friday at the Khalifa International Stadium,Doha Qatar. "we managed to go the past hurdle(heats) successfully and we are now looking to claim the first three slots.If we embrace team work then it will be business as usual in the finals.The three of us are targeting the gold medal which makes it tougher for our opponents," she said. The trio will face stiff competition from Uganda's Peruth Chemutai who won the first heat on 9:21.98 and Mekides Abebe of Ethiopia who qualified as one of the best losers. Kiyeng,a 2011 All Africa games champion has a personal best of 9:00.1 while Chespol has 8:58.32. Chepkoech's 8:44.32 record remains unchallenged.
