Lamu MCAs are unhappy with the small revenue allocated to the county by the National Treasury after President Uhuru Kenyatta assented to the Division of Revenue Bill, 2019 last week. Counties have been allocated Sh316 billion out of which Lamu will get Sh2.59 billion. Other counties with small allocations are Elgeyo Marakwet (Sh3.86 billion), Tharaka Nithi (Sh3.92 billion), Laikipia (Sh4.17 billion) and Taita Taveta (Sh4.24 billion). The MCAs, led by Speaker Paul Kimani, on Tuesday, said the allocation was a slap in the face given the vast infrastructural and geographical challenges in the region. They said the allocation was a perpetuation of the marginalisation since the start of devolution in 2013. “They have done this over the years and it’s not helping us move forward. It is unfair considering what we have to deal with in terms of infrastructure,” Kimani said. The MCAs said Lamu, as the host of the Sh2.5 trillion upcoming port and Lapsset, among others, will experience a population migration and that should have been reason enough for the Treasury to increase its allocation. "This is no longer your usual Lamu; this Lamu is steadily turning into an industrial hub and attracting millions of people who are coming to settle and do business. There is bound to be conflict over the small resources unless we are given more money,” the speaker said. The MCAs complained that the criteria used to allocate funds to counties failed to consider the area covered by the Indian Ocean which was recorded when Lamu’s size was determined. Hongwe Ward MCA James Komu said Lamu faces costly transportation across the Indian Ocean and urged the CARA to increase the allocation to at least Sh3.5 billion. “Working in Lamu is very expensive mostly due to transportation which is by boat over the Indian Ocean yet they must all be reached for service delivery,” he said. Nominated MCA Amina Kale the situation has held Lamu hostage to poverty and underdevelopment. Edited by R.Wamochie
