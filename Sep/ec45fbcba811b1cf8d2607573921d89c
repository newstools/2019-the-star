Three suspects, including a woman, have been arrested in Nairobi as part of a syndicate accused of stealing motor vehicles in the city. The trio is believed to be part of a gang that has been stealing cars in Kasarani and Roysambu estates after stupefying their owners at drinking joints. They were nabbed by detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations at West View Plaza in Kahawa West on Saturday. Kasarani sub-county police commander Peter Kamani said police had been hunting for the suspects for long. He identified them as Francis Kinyanjui (53), Gladys Wanjiku (36) and Stephen Njoroge (33). Kimani said Njoroge was the gang leader whom they have been hunting for a long time in connection with robberies. Several items were confiscated during the raid. Police also impounded a Probox and confiscated phones, many SIM cards, and assorted psychotropic drugs. Kimani said that the items will be kept as exhibits. “The suspects will be interrogated. They will tell the police where other vehicles are,” Kimani told reporters at his office on Saturday. The three were locked up at Kasarani police station. They will be arraigned on Monday. Area DCIO Mwenda Meme said undercover investigations were underway following complaints from the public. Meme said Seasons in Kasarani, Garden Estate, and Kahawa West were the most notorious estates for car theft.  edited by peter obuya
