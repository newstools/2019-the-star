Kiambaa MP Paul Koinange has urged legislators to review betting laws and enforce stringent measures to discourage gambling. Koinange said that betting has caused frustrations among youth, some of whom have entered into crime to support their gambling habits. “The money spent in betting only benefits those who do the business,” Koinange said. The MP spoke on Monday in Kiratina in Githunguri where he was a guest at a football tournament. Parliament is already discussing  Gaming Bill 2019 drafted by the National Assembly Sports, Culture and Tourism Committee. Committee chair Victor Munyaka said in May, that the new laws are meant to seal the numerous loopholes in the multi-billion shillings industry Koingange, who is the chairman of the Security Committee in Parliament, called upon Kenyans to be wary of betting as it had become a disease and a baggage. “I call upon Kenyans to work hard to get their rightful earnings as money which comes easy also gets depleted fast,” Koinange said. He said that the government should take stern action against the persons behind betting and their properties should be confiscated. The lawmaker said betting also encourages the escalation of alcoholism among youths and leaders should endeavor to fight it.
