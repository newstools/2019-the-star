Be aware of con men asking for money for Huduma number details, the government has said. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i in a post on Twitter said fraudsters are sending out texts and making calls asking people to pay Sh150 to receive their processed details as captured in the concluded Huduma Namba data collection exercise. He instead said communication will be done through their official channels once NIIMS is ready. Matiang'i added that no one will be asked to pay any amount of money to receive his/her detail. The government closed the mass Huduma Namba registration process on May 1 after running for 45 days but said that anyone who had not been captured can still visit chief's offices countrywide to register. President Uhuru Kenyatta had launched the countrywide process on April 2 in Machakos county. The process was meant to ensure that the government provides its services to the citizens efficiently.
