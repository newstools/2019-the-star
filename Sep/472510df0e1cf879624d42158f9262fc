 PSV operators on Wednesday paralysed road transport in Matuga, protesting against "unfair competition" from Probox cars, school buses and county vehicles. The more than 100 matatu workers said the Proboxes, in particular, had "become a nuisance to our jobs. They steal our customers". Their sacco chairman Joseph Mutunga complained, “It has become hard to do this work. We are required to have driving licences, vehicle inspection stickers, parking taxes, PSV licences, among others. They all cost money, yet private car owners require very few documents." Assistant chairman Hamisi Unda said the "small" cars violate the county parking laws which demand that all (PSV) vehicles must use the main stage to pick or drop off passengers.  “Matatus are asked to operate in a designated area while in town, yet our colleagues (Proboxes) work from any place. We spend so many hours waiting for customers at the stage yet they are busy reaping profits that legally belong to us,” Unda said. The operators accused police officers of complicity as some own those cars. “The worst thing when you try to confront these guys, a number of them will remove pistols and police handcuffs, saying there is nothing we can do to them,” Kwale Youth Stage chairman Mwamyuga Mtsumi said. Road and Infrastructure CEC Hemedi Mwabudzo denied that county vehicles compete for passengers. They only pick county officials, he said. County commander Alexander Munyao said they will not allow anybody to usurp police powers to profiteer from public transport. “It doesn’t matter if a person is a police officer, or soldier. Rules must be followed,” he said. Munyao said police will man the highways to stop private vehicles from ferrying paying passengers without the requisite licences. He asked matatu operators to be peaceful and resume work as their grievances are addressed. Edited by R.Wamochie
