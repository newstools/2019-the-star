Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi has said his administration will allocate more funds to improve health services. “I have significantly focused on health services in my manifesto and, true to our road map, health has been adequately funded and staffed. We have the responsibility of ensuring we offer the best services to our people across the county,” he said. Abdi spoke in Wajir town on Saturday during a ceremony to flag off medical equipment donated by United Muslim Relief. The governor urged health practitioners to  uphold professionalism when discharging their duties. Abdi said he would soon commission transformative projects such as a maternal and child health centre, CT scans and ICU units. He said he was encouraged by the reduction of maternal mortality and stillbirths, which he attributed to increased  health facilities and medical staff. Wajir is among 15 counties with the highest burden of maternal mortality. “Our target is to have fewer than 100 deaths per 100,000 live births. This is achievable if we remain committed and focused. Our key flagship projects are progressing well, notably the renal unit and the blood donation centre,” he said. He said the equipment provided by UMR will add to successes in the sector and contribute to the improvement of the county's performance indicators. The equipment donated consisted of surgical, general ward, gynecological, orthopaedic, unaesthetic, non-pharmaceutical and dental items. “UMR will remain deep in the hearts of Wajir people. Their support is a true statement of a deep love and true friendship with the county leadership and the citizens of Wajir county. They have also demonstrated great humanitarian concerns and help and we thank them immensely,” the governor said. UMR regional coordinator Abdulqani Ismail said the organisation will continue extending its support to counties to  improve services.
