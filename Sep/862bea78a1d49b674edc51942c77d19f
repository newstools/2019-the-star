A zebra crossing helps pedestrian cross the road. But motorists in Kenya do not respect the feature very likely putting the lives of pedestrians in danger. Some motorists speed up at the zebra crossing leaving one to wonder if they really care about fellow road users yet to be blessed with wheels. Motorists may also jam up the crossing areas forcing pedestrians to walk around, which beats the logic of the feature. NTSA should deploy officials at the crossing areas and ensure drivers respect pedestrians. Areas near schools should also have a zebra crossing.  Mombasa
