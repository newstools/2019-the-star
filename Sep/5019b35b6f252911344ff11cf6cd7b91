Reigning national men’s champions Kenya Ports Authority have two tight Premier League matches in Nairobi this weekend. The porters are placed behind leaders Thunder and Ulinzi Warriors on the log. They play Collins Gaya’s high-riding Thunder on Saturday before taking on Equity Bank. KPA’s two opponents posted wins over the weekend and the porters will have to be very cautious. Fresh from holiday, struggling United States International University sides have a tall order and are currently rooted in the basement of the table. USIU men meet Ulinzi Warriors and Kenya College of Accountancy University while their women counterparts have a date with Eagles Wings and Equity Bank. The University of Nairobi Dynamites confronts Zetech University, who are back after a huge loss to KPA in Mombasa. This will be a tight fight. At the Kenyatta Sports ground in Kisumu,  Strathmore University Blades tackle Lakeside while the Swords travel uphill to Kakamega to meet Western Delight. On Sunday, Africa Nazarene University hope that Caroline Njeri, fresh from the All Africa Games, will help them against Eagle Wings. KPA women, on the other hand, will host Storms at their Makande Welfare hall backyard. The ports women are battling Equity for the top spot. The other match will see Zetech University return to square it off against Kenyatta University Oryx in another varsity match up.
