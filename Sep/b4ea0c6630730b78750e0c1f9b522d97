A man has been charged with defiling a 15-year-old girl while she was taking a shower in Kangemi estate, Nairobi. Andrew Mackenzie, 37, is accused of storming into an outdoor bathroom where the girl was taking a bath before going to school on Thursday last week. The prosecution told the court that Mackenzie left his wife in the house and rushed out when he saw the complainant going to the bathroom. “He used a towel to cover her mouth so she could not scream and threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the incident,” the police said. The officer said after he defiled her, the girl continued bathing, and left for school without saying a word. "He told me that if I cry, he would do something strange to my body. He defiled me and left. I finished taking my bath and after that proceeded to school without telling anyone,’’ she told the police. Police records show that the girl’s teacher observed that she was gloomy and  sought to find out the reason for that. “She remained unfocused throughout the day. I suspected something might not be right. So I escalated the issue to the school principal,” her teacher told the police. During break time, the Form One student went and reported to the school secretary about the incident. The school administration called her mother and asked her to come to school. The girl was later taken to a private hospital before the matter was reported at a police station. The accused person was arrested and taken to Kabete police station, then later taken to court and charged. Mackenzie denied the charges when he appeared before Kibera senior principal magistrate Barbara Ojoo. The magistrate granted him Sh300, 000 bond and a surety of a similar amount. The matter will be mentioned on October 8 before the hearing on November 11.
