The post mortem on Dutch tycoon Tob Cohen has been postponed to tomorrow. "There is the issue of identification of the body. The team representing the lady in custody needs to be here... the lawyer is going to court either to pray that the suspect is here to identify the body or send somebody else," Pathologist Peter Ndegwa told Journalists on Tuesday. Ndegwa who was speaking in Chiromo mortuary said the defense also objected to his presence saying that he might lean on the DCI side. "The postmortem will not happen today due to technicalities. I was in the scene of the crime. The defense team feel that is should not represent the government. So Johansen Oduor who was on leave has agreed to temporarily resume work for the exercise tomorrow," he said. Cohen's body was found at Kitisuru home last week. Cohen, 71, was reported missing on July 19 but Directorate of Criminal Investigation detectives failed to locate him. His phone was reported to be off since he went missing. His wife, Sarah Wairimu is currently in police custody over his murder which DCI boss George Kinoti described as gruesome.
