Y MAURICE ALAL @alalmaurice The government will roll out water projects worth Sh3.6 billion to expand coverage in Western region. Water and Sanitation CS Simon Chelugui on Tuesday said the expansion will increase water coverage to 70 per cent. The coverage currently stands at 60 per cent. The increase in water coverage will be attained by the year 2030. Chelugui said the government has a strategy to ensure every citizen has access to clean, safe and affordable water. He spoke in Kisumu during the launch of the Standards and Guidelines of Wash infrastructure in pre-primary and primary schools. The programme is funded by  UNICEF. “We have identified the sources of our resources and the focus. I believe, in the last one year, based on our statistics, the national water coverage increased by 1.5 per cent,” Chelugui said. The CS said the French Development Bank has given a Sh 3.6 billion grant for the expansion of water and sewerage services for counties in Western. He said expansion works at the Kisumu Water and Sewerage Company inlet has been ongoing for the last six months. “We have invested in production in Dunga and Kibuye. Currently, we are expanding the Nyalenda ponds,” he said. Chelugui said the ongoing works in Kisii is nearly 95 per cent complete. Some Sh1 billion has been set aside to improve sewerage services in Oyugis, Homa Bay, Ukwala and Seme towns. In Migori, the CS said water supply expansion is complete and that the ministry was looking for land to expand the sanitation facility in the town.  edited by peter obuya
