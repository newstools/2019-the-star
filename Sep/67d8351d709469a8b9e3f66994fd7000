Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi has nominated a new board to oversee public service operations in the county. In a statement to the media on Monday, Abdi named Jellee Ibrahim and Adow Ahmed as chairperson and secretary to the board respectively. Rashid Osman, Rukia Hassan, Mohamed Omar, Ahmed Billow and Deka Adan were nominated as members of the board. The nomination follows the expiry of the tenure of the former board. Once approved by the county assembly, the new team will serve for six years. In a letter dated August 30, the governor urged MCAs to approve the names in order to facilitate the inauguration of the new board. “I petition the county assembly to expedite the approval process to facilitate a smooth transition of the board and continuity of service delivery,” Governor Abdi said. He noted that in making the nominations, he considered all constitutional requirements. “I have considered the need to reflect the ethnic diversity and regional dynamics of Wajir county,” the county boss said.
