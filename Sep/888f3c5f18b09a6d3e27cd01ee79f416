Ward representatives have accused MPs from Mbeere of failing to lobby for development projects during DP William Ruto’s two-day tour of Embu. The MCAs said parliamentarians led Ruto to open Winas Sacco office, which  is privately-owned, instead of commissioning a major government-funded water project. The DP spent two days in Embu at the weekend, where he launched several national projects in Mbeere South, Mbeere North, Runyenjes and Manyatta constituencies. He also attended a fundraiser at Embu Catholic Dioceses Cathedral on Sunday morning, before leaving for Nairobi. Led by deputy speaker Steve Munene, the MCAs said Mbeere South MP Geoffrey King’ang’i and his Mbeere North counterpart Muriuki Njagagua were "reduced to listeners" during the DP’s two-day visit. Speaking at Muraru market during a public participation on Punguza Mizigo Bill, Munene said the water shortage has been a big problem in Mbeere. He said the provision of clean water is a priority for people. But MPs Njagagua and King'ang'i dismissed the MCAs allegations, terming them  lies. Njagagua said during the DP’s tour he re-launched the 10km Kiritiri-Siakago road, the Siakago Technical College and lobbied for connections to piped water in the area, among other projects. King'ang'i said he has always lobbied for projects from the government and that the DP has been in the constituency for development matters many times during his tenure. Minority leader Lenny Masters said Mbeere South subcounty needs to delink itself from the Embu Water and Sanitation Company (EWASCO) and form its own water service provider because residents have suffered for a long time.
