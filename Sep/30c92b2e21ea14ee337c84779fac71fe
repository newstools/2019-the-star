 Deaf persons in Embu have decried lack of interpreters and discrimination, saying they are denied employment and tenders by the county government. The Deaf Empowerment Society of Kenya, led by CEO Jacob Ireri on Thursday staged a peaceful demonstration in Embu town demanding recognition and inclusion in the public offices. The said many of their members were not counted during the census because they were not traced by enumerators. Speaking through an interpreter, Charles Kamanzi said those counted had details not properly captured due to communication barriers. He said deaf people were experiencing difficulties at Huduma centres, law courts, hospitals, county offices, and police stations because they don't have interpreters. “We are carrying out this demonstration to fight for inclusion in all the affairs of public interest just like the hearing population. We seriously need recognition,” Kimanzi said. The deaf said lack of interpreters was largely to blame for the delay of their cases in court. They said justice delayed is justice denied and called for employment of interpreters. Embu Huduma centre manager Peter Ituma said they have three employees trained in sign language and who often interpret when deaf persons seek services.  edited by peter obuya
