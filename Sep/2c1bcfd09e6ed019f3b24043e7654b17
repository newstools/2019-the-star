The Kenya Ports Authority has been in the news after President Uhuru Kenyatta spoke of suspected corruption. The KPA board has moved to deal with the issues and it's commendable that management has cancelled multiple heavily inflated tenders. The port has recently registered impressive growth and turned a profit in the last financial year. It launched its 30-year master plan, with a development strategy for major ports, lake ports, small coastal ports and the inland container depots. About Sh360 billion will be invested. In an excellent strategic location about halfway between South Africa's Port of Durban and the major Middle East ports, the Port of Mombasa is a gateway to East and Central Africa. It's the hub for international trade in the region since it was developed in the late 19th Century. It is Kenya's largest and busiest port, serving the hinterland by exporting important agricultural produce and supporting the economy. The port also serves Uganda, Tanzania, the DRC, Southern Sudan, Sudan, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Somalia. Inland transportation is provided by truck and train, and special cargo service goes to inland container depots. It is therefore important that investigative agencies, complete their probe as swiftly as possible to allow port managers to focus on development.
