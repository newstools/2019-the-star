Diamond Platinumz’s former bodyguard Mwarabu Fighter says the singer paid him peanuts. In an interview with Bongo 5, he said the money could not sustain his family for even two weeks. Mwarabu was Diamond’s bodyguard for five years, and accompanied him to most of his concerts around the world and events in his personal life. He says when he quit the job he suffered a lot for lack of money. “Let the youth learn from my experience. Despite my commitment to guarding Diamond’s brand, I had nothing in my pocket. At that time, I had no car or motorcycle to ease my movement so I used public service vehicles.” Mwarabu also spoke about the WCB boss mentioning him in his song Inama, featuring Fally Ipupa, regarding rumours he had an affair with Harmonize’s fiance Sarah. He said Diamond and Harmonize know the truth. “They are using their songs to pass on messages but don’t want to speak the truth,” he said. “I’m glad they’re talking about me because they still remember all the big things I did for them.”
