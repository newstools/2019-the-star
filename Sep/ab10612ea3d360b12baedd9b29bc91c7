Police in Homa Bay on Thursday arrested 10 youths for allegedly operating in groups to provide security for people who hire them. County commissioner Herman Shambi said they would conduct a crack down on youths who promote criminal activities. Shambi argued that there are a number of youths who engage in bodybuilding trainings as a group with an aim of getting hired as bodyguards. The commissioner said the training places are also used to sell illegal drugs and illicit brews. “The youths are linked with goons who disrupt peace after they are hired. We’ve realised that they also abuse drugs,” Shambi said. Speaking after they conducted a crackdown at Marina in Shauri Yako estate, Homa Bay township senior chief Joshua Ochogo said they found the youths in a house. Ochogo said their joint operation with police enabled to arrest three suspected chang’aa dealers, six drunkards and a suspected bhang user. The senior chief said some youths who were outside the house ran away.
