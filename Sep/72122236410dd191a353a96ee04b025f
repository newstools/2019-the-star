Para javelin and discus thrower newbie Japheth Kaikai is positive he will scale the ranks and qualify for the inaugural Africa Para Games set for January 26 and 31 in Rabat, Morocco. Kaikai ventured into javelin throwing barely three months ago and has already doubled his initial personal best. The inaugural Africa Para Games will also be used as the Tokyo Olympics qualifiers. Classified in class 57 (for throwers who sit), Kaikai initial distance was 10 metres in both events but has since doubled to 26m (discus) and 18m (javelin). Kaikai, a tailor based in Kibera, was confident that by the time they get to the trials, he will have surpassed the javelin cut off distance of 31m and discus’ 33m. “I am really working hard and my target is to qualify for the Africa Para Games. I want to be a good athlete and I have new targets and goals every day,” said Kaikai, who joined coach Caroline Mabel stable of eight (four apiece in both genders) six months ago at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Kaikai started with the sitting volleyball before shifting to athletics 12 weeks later. The coach intimated that they are planning to increase training days from two to four every week in the next month and this will increase Kaikai’s chances of qualifying. “He is a fast learner hence his steady progress. With our planned training programme ahead of the trials in November, his chances will be enhanced,” said Mabel. "By the time we get to the trials, I am confident I will be able to surpass the cut off distance of 31m,” added Kaikai who also acknowledged Joseph Mosonik- Julius Yego’s javelin coach who once in a while steps in to assist Mabel.
