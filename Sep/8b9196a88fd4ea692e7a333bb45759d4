A Nairobi has granted Africa Spirits Limited and WOW Beverages directors access to their premises for collection and surrender of old currency notes. The directive follows an application by defense lawyer Cecil Miller seeking an order for the  the re-opening of the Thika-based factory. Miller said that the fate of over 500 employees hangs in the balance following closure. He told magistrate Francis Andayi that he wants evidence taken at the factory today after which it should be handed over to the owners. “The firm alongside WOW Beverages used to remit Sh150 million every month to the taxman and its ironical that they are unable to remit the same yet its shareholders are in court over tax matters,” he argued. Miller further said since the prosecution had rushed to charge businessman Humphrey Kariuki and his co-accused, they should be equally expedite the case. The  lawyer said that that given the scenario, the taxman has lost Sh1.2 billion in revenue so far from Africa Spirits and WOW Beverages.
