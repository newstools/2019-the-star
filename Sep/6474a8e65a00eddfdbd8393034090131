The county government of Lamu has fired three senior officials after their dockets were merged with other departments. This comes just five months after two CECs quit their jobs and another was suspended for unknown reasons. County secretary John Mburu confirmed chief officers Simon Komu (Fisheries), Mohamed Badawy (Water Resources) and Julius Okindo (Agriculture) had been served with termination letters. The affected officials had served for less than a year after their appointment last  October. Speaking in Lamu on Wednesday, Mburu said the county merged their offices with others to improve efficiency. He defended the move, saying there was no malice and that it was meant to accommodate budgetary cuts that forced them to cut down the workforce and reduce departments from 14 to 10. The Finance and Planning was merged with Budget under one chief officer while Agriculture and Irrigation was merged with Water Resources. Livestock and Cooperative Development was merged with Fisheries while Trade, Tourism and Industrialisation was merged with Public Service Management. “We can’t really say its firing per se. What we did is reduce the departments. Unfortunately in that process, some people lost their jobs. All this happened in line with the budget realities and for the efficiency of running business,” the county secretary said. He denied that the terminations were politically instigated and asked the public not to be misled. “This is purely administrative and has nothing political to it,” he said. Okindo is a former Kenya Maritime Authority employee and also served as acting county secretary for six months between February and July 2018 before Mburu took office. He has also served as the Public Service Management chief officer before being moved to Agriculture. Komu, on the other hand, served as county Fisheries director in the former regime before he was absorbed by the current government. Edited by R.Wamochie
