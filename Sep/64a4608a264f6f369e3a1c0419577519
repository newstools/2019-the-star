Police officers in Trans Mara West, Narok county, have arrested a man suspected of being involved in terrorism, defilement and robbery. Deputy police boss James Odera on Saturday said Eric Lemiso Ledama, 34, had gone to Kilgoris police station to claim his motorcycle, which was being held at Esoit police post, when officers discovered he was a wanted man. His arrest comes after he visited the police headquarters in Nairobi to lodge a complaint about his motorcycle. He was given a letter of assistance so that the detained motorbike could be released. “We discovered that the man was wanted for alleged involvement in terrorist activities by security officers in Makindu, Makueni county. He also has three robbery cases pending before a Kilgoris court,” Odera said. The officer said the suspect had a defilement case, which was awaiting sentencing, before a Kilgoris law court, but he had escaped from custody while undergoing treatment at Kisii Level 5 Hospital. The suspect will be presented to the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit in Nairobi for further investigations. “We were suspicious of the suspect who had a fake bandage on his face. He claimed he was assaulted by unknown people who were targeting to take his wife away,” Odera said.
