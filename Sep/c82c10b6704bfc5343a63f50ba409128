Kiambu County Governor Ferdinand Waititu appeared before the Kenya Revenue Authority in response to the summons issued to him on September 3, 2019. He appeared before KRA on Thursday 12. Waititu was presented with his tax issues due and was given a chance to explain himself. He was also allowed until Monday to provide information that would assist in the investigation and assessment of the taxes rightly due and payable. Should he be required for further engagement as the investigations continue, he was notified to be on standby. Waititu was briefed on KRA's Investigation Department mandate which include detection, disruption and deterrence as means of enhancing voluntary taxpayer compliance. He was also taken through the process of investigations and the available options, including criminal proceedings as outlined in KRA's investigations handbook.
