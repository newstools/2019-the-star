 A suspect in the murder of an Eldoret-based policewoman is in hospital in critical condition after allegedly taking poison before he was arrested. Joshua Ogach, a Nairobi trader, is alleged to have stabbed constable Robinah Moraa several times in her Eldoret house. Moraa, who was in her early 30s, was attached to the Naiberi Police station in Eldoret. Ogach was arrested in a Nakuru hospital on Friday where he was taken after allegedly taking poison to avoid arrest. He could barely stand when he appeared before High Court deputy registrar Grace Sitati on Monday. Sitati ordered that he be taken to hospital and returned to court on Tuesday but his condition deteriorated. Prosecutor Meshack Rop told the court that doctors at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital had recommended that Ogach be admitted. He will be brought to court ehrn his health improves.
