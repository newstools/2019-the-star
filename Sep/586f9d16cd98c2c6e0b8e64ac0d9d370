Seven Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) Premier League players have received month-long offers to train with German clubs. The players leave the country tomorrow. Telkom’s creative lynchpin Lillian Aura, overlapping defender Flavia Mutiva and wing wizard Maureen Okumu have been picked from the women’s category alongside Strathmore forward Gilly Okumu. Willis Okeyo, who anchors Police central midfield position, Wazalendo’s pacy striker Danston Baraza and fast-rising Moses Ademba of Butali will make the men’s line-up. Gilly and Okeyo will train in Germany for the second time this year having been recalled by Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart clubs respectively. The two had a five-week training in May. The men’s duo will join Okeyo at VfB Stuttgart while Aura, Mutiva and Okumu will train with Bonn Club. Telkom hope the three will help the club win their 11th African Club Championship title upon return. Telkom coach Jos Openda said the move will help both the club and the national teams in terms of international experience and exposure. “It was evident that our national teams lacked exposure during the Olympic qualifiers and we hope this kind of training will plug into the gaps and help us go one step better. We were inferior throughout the tourney against the likes of South Africa and Egypt who have the majority of their players in Europe. He said: “These are opportunities that you can't turn down and goes along in helping the players get new techniques. We need this kind of experience at all levels. We are preparing for African Club Championship at the end of the year and this exposure will come in handy.” Okumu said: “It will be a pleasure to return home and I can’t wait to get started. I am processing my visa in readiness for the move. Probably I will travel on Friday.”
