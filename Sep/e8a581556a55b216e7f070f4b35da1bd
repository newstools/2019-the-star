Three-time World Half Marathon champion Geoffrey Kamworor has urged Kenyan athletes to take local races seriously if they are ton thrive in international races. Kamworor also a former New York City Marathon champion, said he built his running career in local races and he is what he is today because of the same. “As an athlete, you have to start from somewhere before competing at the international stage. I started from such races and made it internationally. I urge my fellow athletes to compete in local races,” said the two-time world cross country champion. Kamworor said this while calling on the athletes across the country to honour  Kaptagat Forest Half Marathon tomorrow.  The race ambassador said there is a need to conserve Kaptagat Forest, which has been training ground for many athletes. “This has been a good training base for athletes and destruction of the natural habitat also affects athletes,” added Kamworor who will be competing at the Copenhagen Half marathon in a fortnight. Race director Patrick Birgen said the event, heading into the second edition tomorrow is meant to conserve Kaptagat Forest.
