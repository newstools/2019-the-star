 The Ministries of Agriculture and Health have clashed on whether the government should lift the ban on Genetically Modified Foods, commonly known as GMOs. Agriculture and Crop Development PS Hamadi Boga and his Health counterpart Susan Mochache yesterday clashed on the safety of GMOs before Senators. Boga said GMOs are safe for human and animal consumption but Mochache insisted several pieces of research have put doubts on the safety of the products. “There is no independent research that has directly linked GMOs to cancer or these other diseases as we are told,” Boga told the Senate joint committee on Agriculture and Health. He said the government should lift the ban on GMOs to improve food production and end shortages. Boga said that several studies conducted by Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organisation and other agencies have shown that GMOs are safe. “We cannot use rumours and publications we don’t know their sources to spread fear among people. GMOs is the way to go if we want to increase food production as a country,” Boga said. Mochache however called for caution in handling GMOs, saying human life should not be comprised. “The Ministry of Health advocates for precautionary use of GMOs as recommended by the task force that gave the advise to lift the ban on GMO imports on case by case basis,” she said. The government banned the importation of GMOs in 2013 after it emerged that they were not safe for both human and animal consumption. Yesterday, the joint committee co-chaired by Michael Mbito (Trans-Nzoia) and Njeru Ndwiga (Embu) said the submissions by the two PSs had caused more confusion on the safety of the products. The committee is inquiring on whether the ban should be lifted. “We are more confused than we were at the beginning, but we know that the lives of people are paramount,” Ndwiga said.  edited by peter obuya
