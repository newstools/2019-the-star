About five people have been killed by crocodiles, a buffalo or drowned in Makima area of Mbeere South subcounty while trying to get water for domestic use. According to the area MCA Phillip Nzangi, a pregnant woman was killed by a crocodile in Masinga dam recently. In other incidents, Nzangi said, a boy and two bulls drowned in the same dam while yet another boy was killed by a buffalo. He said two other people were attacked by crocodiles but escaped. The area is surrounded hydropower dams and Thiba River but is without piped water, causing suffering among residents. Embu county officials have reiterated the need for clean, safe water for residents. Deputy governor David Kariuki urged politicians from the region to avoid engaging in politics on matters concerning the water project. The leaders spoke on Thursday at Mbondoni shopping centre in Mbeere South during the launch of a Sh108 million piped water project. Kariuki hailed Kengen for availing Sh58 million for the project. The county government allocated Sh50million for the project. Water will be tapped from the dams to the neighbouring areas. Kengen Eastern regional manager Julius Odumbe said the project will solve the problems women have been facing while looking for water. He said it was sad to hear how people were killed by crocodiles and other animals owing to lack of water. Odumbe said that Kengen will ensure the projects is completed and will continue partnering with the county government on other projects. Nzangi and Mwaruko said cases of residents being attacked by crocodiles, drowning, had risen and that the residents will be very greatly relieved by the project. Nzangi said it will be like a miracle for the people to get the piped water noting that the moment they get it they will even organise a party.
