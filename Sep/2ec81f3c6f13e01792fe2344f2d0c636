Governor Wilbur Ottichilo has launched three dental clinics in Vihiga county in a bid to devolve health services from Mbale Referral Hospital. The governor opened dental clinics in Emuhaya, Luanda, and Sabatia subcounties. The governor said residents will now access dental health services within their subcounty. Ottichillo said it will help many people to reduce travelling costs while seeking dental services. “The only case that will be handled at Mbale hospital will only be those referred from the subcounty hospitals,” he said. While launching the clinics at Emuhaya hospital in Luanda subcounty, he said the referral hospital has been receiving about 1,000 patients annually. County dentist Dr Wandei Odhiambo said there was a rise in patients reporting dental problems. “Lifestyle and the refined foods that we are consuming are the major causes of dental problems that the majority are suffering from,” Odhiambo said. Odhiambo says dental cases are 100 per cent preventable. However most people have failed to observe the dental clinics rules and visiting dentists as a measure. Health chief officer Arnold Mamadi said the county has spent Sh15 million to equip dental clinics. “We have hired qualified dentists who will handle these dental cases within this county,” Mamadi said. Residents have applauded the opening of the clinics saying that it has been difficult to access dental services. Deputy governor Patrick Saisi who had accompanied his boss assured the health workers that erroneous deductions on their payslips has been rectified. (edited by O. Owino)
