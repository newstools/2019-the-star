When Eva Karendi, a waiter at the Nice Digital City Hotel in Mwea stumbled on Sh60,000 left behind by a customer, her first thought was to keep it safe. The money had been left in a stack of Sh1, 000 notes inside a purse. “I fear God and was prepared to keep it until the owner came back for it, even if it was after one year,” Karendi said. Karendi took the whole amount to the hotel’s director for safekeeping. But there was no business card or anything to help them get in touch with the owner On realising that she'd left her purse at the hotel, Esther Mbaabu, a tutor at Meru Teachers College went back to the hotel and found her money intact. “I was so happy that they found the money and kept it safe for me. I wanted to meet the young girl because what she did was so unselfish and kind,” she said. Mbaabu said she has become good friends with Karendi. “She is from a humble background and I want to support her to upgrade her education,” Mbaabu said. The hotel’s director, Njiru Mkombozi said Karendi has shown discipline, honesty and respectable gesture that many Kenyan youths should emulate. “She will be promoted. We have also given her a pay rise,” he said. Mbaabu said they had taken their daughter to school in Nairobi and went to the hotel for a meal but accidentally left the purse behind. “The money was for a group of orphans I support, and had meant to deposit it at an Mpesa agent but as I was in a hurry,” she said. Mbaabu said she did not immediately notice whether she had carried her purse into the hotel and until they arrived at Nkubu Heritage Hotel when she realised the purse was missing.
