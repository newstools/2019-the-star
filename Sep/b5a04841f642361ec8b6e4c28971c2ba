The office of the Director of Criminal Investigations has dismissed claims that Samwel Gateri was among the state witnesses lined up to testify in digital strategist Denis Itumbi's case. Through its Twitter page on Monday, the DCI said Gateri is a man under investigation and at no point was he lined up as a state witness. However, Samwel Gateri's name was among the names listed by the prosecution in the charge sheet against Itumbi. Gareri had told the court on Monday that DCI has been forcing him to make a confession and admitting that he personally knows Itumbi and Deputy President William Ruto. In an application filed under urgency, Gateri says that he was arrested on July 2 by the DCI and the officers forcibly seized and took his cellphones, national ID card and other personal items. He alleged the officers threatened that they would take him to high ranking security personnel in the government so that he could be dealt with. In its response, DCI said that all statements by witnesses on the case have been supplied to the defense team and Samwel Gateri Wanjiru is not among them.
