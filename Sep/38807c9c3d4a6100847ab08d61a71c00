The government has warned leaders and other people threatening the Mau evictees who are leaving the forest land at will. Narok South Sub County Deputy Commissioner Felix Kisalu said some evictees have been threatened not to leave their farms. Speaking in Ololulunga yesterday, Kisalu told the leaders to stop their baseless coercion or else face the law. “We appreciate the people who heeded the government to vacate the forest and this will lead to the safety of their families and their properties,” said Kisalu. He added that the inciters were only using the illegal settlers for their own interests. “Don’t allow a few people to mislead you that you will continue to stay in the forest or that there will be compensation. What will assist you is to know the government's stand on this matter,” he said. The administrator also noted that some of the settlers who are willing to leave the forest and do not have means of transport to carry their belongings should immediately report to their local chiefs as the state will provide arrangements. Kisalu also revealed that more than 20 people residing around the Mau forest have surrendered their illegal title deeds, land agreement and allotment letters to the government. He said this will help the state to know the people who conned others by selling to them the forest land. “I pity those people who are opposing the government's move to surrender land documents to the state because this will assist us in knowing the people who fraudulently sold land to you,” said Kasalu. The second phase of the water towers restoration is estimated to affect over 60,000 people including an alleged 8,000 school goingchildren and over 1,000 candidates set to sit their national exams this year.
