Kirinyaga MCAs on Tuesday rejected the Punguza Mizigo drive. Assembly Majority Leader Kamau Murango had presented the bill, but it was not seconded, effectively leaving it in limbo. Addressing a press conference after the assembly session, Waiguru said she was pleased with MCAs' decision to reject the bill. She said it was not favourable to residents, nor was it good for women. Last week, Uasin Gishu county passed the bill. Uasin Gishu county assembly speaker David Kiplagat confirmed that the county has passed the bill and would forward their resolutions to the speakers of both the National Assembly and Senate.
