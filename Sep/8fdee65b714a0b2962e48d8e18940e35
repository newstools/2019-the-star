A petroleum distributors lobby is seeking temporary orders barring the police from raiding and closing down their premises over new gad distribution laws. In a court application, Kenya Independent Petroleum Distributors Association Limited has also sued the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA). “This honorable court be pleased to issue temporary restraining orders against the energy regulator from interfering with their business premises,” court papers said. Police have in recent days been arresting gas dealers countrywide following a September 5 order from Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho to implement the gas rules and send a report to his office every Friday. The petitioners claim that the Inspector of Police and the regulatory authority have been harassing their members demanding that they must have a license issued by the petroleum regulatory authority. Further, they pointed out that the demand by the regulatory authority is contrary to the provisions of the Energy Act requiring that oil retailers should only have a license from the county government. The regulatory authority and police boss have been accused of raiding  and shutting business premises owned by the members of the petitioners. Following the closure of businesses,  the traders argue they risk being auctioned for failing to meet their financial obligations. They argue that continued closure of their business premises is an upfront to constitutional rights of the petitioner. “That the respondents jointly raided the premises of one of their members and preferred charges against him in the principal magistrate court at Kandara,” court documents said. According to court papers, some of the members of the petitioner are already suffering huge losses following closure of business. “Other members are now apprehensive that their premises could be raided and shut by the EPRA and inspector of police,” they said.
