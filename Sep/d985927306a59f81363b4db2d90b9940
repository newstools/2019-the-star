A suspect in Dutch tycoon Tob Cohen's murder case wants to be released on bail. Peter Karanja, who is being held by detectives, has filed an application before a Kiambu court seeking to be produced in court or be released on bail pending investigations. Karanja, through his team of lawyers led by Felix Kiprono Matakei and Festus Mbati, says that his rights have been violated by police who have detained him since September 10. In the application under a certificate of urgency, the lawyers said that Karanja has been denied access to sufficient medication while in detention. They said Karanja was arrested on September 10, 2019, at around 4 pm at Shell Petrol Station, Gilgil by at least six armed men in a grotesques commando style. Karanja is the ex-husband of Gilgil MP Martha Wangari. He along with Cohen's wife, Sarah Wairimu were detained after Cohen went missing for weeks. Cohen's body was found last Friday by DCI detectives inside an underground water tank in his Kitisuru compound.
