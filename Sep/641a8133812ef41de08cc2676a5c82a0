Busia county assembly will debate the Thirdway Alliance party’s Punguza Mizigo Bill, 2019 that proposes far-reaching amendments to the Constitution. The bill was tabled by minority leader Felix Omanyi and seconded by legal affairs committee vice chairman Bernard Papa at 2.30pm on Tuesday Speaker Bernard Wamalwa committed the draft bill to the Legal Affairs and Human Rights Committee to come up with a report that should be tabled before October 14. Omanyi said the sponsor of the bill Ekuru Aukot will address the assembly from 9.15am on Wednesday to shed more light on the document. Members will interrogate the document and raise pertinent issues affecting them, he said. “Members of the public are welcome to the public gallery to hear engagements. This is a public matter and Busia is not unique since the sponsor has visited other assemblies in the country,” he said. Papa said the Legal Affairs Human Rights Committee will come up with a comprehensive report. The bill seeks, among other proposals, to reduce the number of Members of Parliament from the current 416 to 147, and abolish the position of deputy governor.
