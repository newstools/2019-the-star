Kenya Revenue Authority has cleared betting firm SportPesa, paving the way for the company to get back its trading licence. Following the clearance, SportPesa will now apply for a new licence to be issued by the Betting Control and Licensing Board. On Tuesday, the firm said that it had positive engagement with the government and it was optimistic of resuming business soon. "Our sessions with regulators and government are targeted towards creating a better understanding of the gaming industry with the view of creating a shared perspective on related regulation, including tax administration," SportPesa said. The government revoked SportPesa's licence in July on grounds that the company had failed to meet its tax obligations. The firm, however, said it was compliant. SportPesa in August cancelled all local sponsorships and advertisements, citing an unfavourable business environment. However, the company has now said it is pleased with its engagement with government agencies. "There has been notable progress in these sessions and we are pleased that Kenya Revenue Authority has now cleared us to have our license renewed," the firm said. The company has said that it will soon announce the date when it will resume business. The gaming firm was among the 27 affected by the governmentâ€™s decision to cancel operating licences and close pay bill numbers.
