A suspected fraudster who was arrested on Saturday night for skipping court was arraigned on Monday. Zachary Mwangi Kariuki denied charges before Kibera senior resident magistrate Faith Mutuku, saying he was sickly. The court had issued an arrest warrant in April when he failed to attend sessions for several fraud cases. He is accused of obtaining Sh1.6 million from Pankaj Patel in 2012. On Monday, he was composed and talkative, even giving the prosecution a hard time. He opposed the magistrate's opinion that he was not sick, saying he was indeed very sick at the time of arrest. "I was not bedridden, I had just left the hospital in Limuru when detectives pounced on me, I am hypertensive and depressed,” Mwangi told Mutuku. On some occasions, Mutuku was forced to cut him short and ask him to relax before responding. The state counsel struggled to explain the way forward as the magistrate pressed the accused person to elaborate. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations announced the arrest on its official Twitter account on Sunday. DCI said several members of the public came out with various complaints about Mwangi obtaining money by false pretence. “He is in lawful custody awaiting arraignment on Monday.  If anyone has ever fallen victim, kindly report at your nearest police station,” the DCI's tweet read. Mutuku ordered that Mwangi be remanded and directed him to appear in court on September 18 with medical documents to confirm  his illness. Edited by R.Wamochie
