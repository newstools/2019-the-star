Jubilee nominated MP Maina Kamanda has hailed Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia for declaring that only President Uhuru Kenyatta will give the direction which Central Kenya region will take once his term expires. He said that is the way to go, a move that should be emulated by other governors in the region. The MP spoke to the Star on the phone yesterday. During the crowning of the retired chief, Joseph Thiong’o Gitau as Kikuyu king at Githirioni in Lari, Kiambu county, on Saturday, Kimemia said at the opportune moment, all the leaders in the region will stand, and speak with one voice behind President Uhuru. He said the region should not tarnish the President’s name at his home by dividing the people along Kieleweke-Tangatanga political divide for the Kikuyu community to be seen as divided. “At the end, all of us whether governors, senators, woman representatives or MPs shall stand with our Uhuru and speak with one voice that shall guide the national leadership. It shall not be that as a community, with our numbers and wealth, get edged to find no space in national leadership, “Kimemia said Kimemia claimed about 60 per cent of the Nairobi county population originate from Central Kenya region, hence Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko should also join the Central Kenya region bloc. Central Kenya region is made of 10 counties where Kimemia is the chairman. Kamanda said as the bloc chairman, Kimemia’s statement is not only positive but also strong. “For once, the Nyandarua Governor has spoken what he has not been able to speak out there before. That is a very strong statement even telling Sonko to join the bloc. To me, that is the right direction," he said.
