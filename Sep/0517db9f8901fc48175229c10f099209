A police officer investigating a case in which a businessman is charged with obtaining Sh2.8 million by false pretence has told the court that the suspect cannot be arrested. Joseph Bitok is investigating the matter in which Noah Moneria Ole Kurraru is accused of defrauding Minto Chicko Self-Help group more than Sh2.8 million by pretending that he was in a position to sell them land. Bitok last week on Thursday told Kibera senior resident magistrate Boaz Ombewa that he had failed to arrest Kurraru. “He is a tricky man, he is elusive. It is difficult to arrest him but we are doing our best. He keeps on escaping us,” he told the court. The officer said the suspect understands what a warrant of arrest meant to him, requesting for three weeks to present him in court. Ombewa ordered the officer to make all efforts to track the suspect's contact. Ombewa said the case has negatively affected the complainants who were present in court and urged for urgency in arresting him. “Every time they come in court but the man is not in. We need to assist them too,” he said. Lawrence Isabo, the complainant, said the case has nearly disintegrated his family as he borrowed the cash from in-laws. “My wife contacted my in-laws who gave her some cash toward the investment. Already I had taken some cash from a bank and together we contributed to get the land,” he said. He said he had spent more money on transport from Kisii to Nairobi for the case. Another complainant, Charles Masita, told the court that one acre of land would cost Sh140,000 and it was situated at Kiserian in Kajiado county. “He took us to view the land and after that, we paid that cash and he later said that the land owner’s family had destroyed the whole deal." The magistrate extended the warrant of arrest against Kurraru for the fourth time on Thursday. The matter will be mentioned on October 12 when the officer is expected to present the accused.
