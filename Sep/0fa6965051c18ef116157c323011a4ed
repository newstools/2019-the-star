Two men have been arraigned for obtaining Sh881,000 by pretending they could supply a woman with snake venom. Dickson Kisoso Maithya, alias Brian, and Jeff Kilonzo are charged with obtaining money by false pretences. The duo allegedly obtained the money from Anita Mueni by lying they were capable of supplying her with snake venom, a fact they knew to be untrue. Appearing at a Milimani court before chief magistrate Francis Andayi, the two pleaded not guilty. They were both released on a Sh200,000 cash bail with an alternative bond of Sh300,000. The case will be mentioned on September 23.
