Mau residents want classes to continue in 15 schools in the forest even after eviction of illegal settlers. But the High Court in Narok adjourned a ruling in the case brought by residents. Uzalendo Institute of Leadership and Democracy, representing Mau residents, had moved to court seeking orders barring the government from closing the 15 primary schools in Maasai Mau. Close to 10,000 children, some of them national exam candidates, will be affected. Narok Land and Environment High Court judge Mohammed Kullow will deliver the ruling on October 22. Through their lawyer Moses Kurgat, the residents named Interior CS Fred Matiang'i, Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai and Rift Valley regional coordinator George Natembeya as respondents. They accuse government agencies of violating the right of children to education. They want the court to compel the Ministry of Education to post teachers in the affected schools so that learning can continue. The petitioners also want the Ministry of Health to be compelled to give services to the children in the affected area even after eviction. “We want to see that the rights of the children of Mau are respected just like the rights of the children everywhere else,” Kurgat said. The government has insisted the eviction will go on after expiry of the 60-day notice. The court also granted an application by Friends of Mau and Mara Conservation to be enjoined in the petition.
