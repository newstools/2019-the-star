Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has said no one except President Uhuru Kenyatta can issue an eviction notice for Mau land. The Majority Leader in the Senate said through a Twitter post on Monday that not even Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko can issue orders. "There will be no eviction from Masai Mau Trust Land until President Uhuru Kenyatta speaks," Murkomen said. He added that Tobiko has no authority to displace people from the area. Murkomen further urged Mau people to proceed with their daily lives and take their children to school for third-term. His statement comes amid a looming second phase of evictions which could affect 60, 000 people. A section of leaders from Rift Valley has asked the government to handle the Mau issue in a humane manner. Through a statement on Saturday, they said the second phase of evictions would hurt 10,000 students. Tobiko had announced that the restoration of the Mau is on course and is unstoppable, issuing an ultimatum of 60 days for settlers to pave way. On July 25, Tobiko vowed to proceed with evictions, saying no amount of intimidation would stop it.
