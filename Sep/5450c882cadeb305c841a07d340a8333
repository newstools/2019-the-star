Police in Kisii have stepped up the hunt for three robbery with violence suspects who are on the run. One of the key suspects escaped on Monday fromÂ  Keroka Law Courts minutes to an expected court judgement on his case. The suspect identified as Douglas Mongera, 33 slithered out of the court as magistrate Bethwel Kimutai was due to give judgement. He is, jointly with others not before the court charged with breaking into a woman's house at Riaisoe in Masaba South subcounty on September 16 2016, raped her, before robbing her of Sh7000. Mongera now joins two other suspects - Evans Okindo and Pius Mongeri - who have been at large since March. Their disappearance forced the magistrate handling the case to issue warrants for their arrest. Yesterday, Kisii county police commander Martin Kibet said police were on the suspects' trails and vowed to bring them to justice. Mongera and his accomplices were first arrested after the break-in into Francisca Magembe Omurwa's home. Douglas Mongera and Evans Okindo are regarded as primary suspects with the third Prius Mongeri, regarded an accomplice by virtue of buying the stolen phone from the assailants. The suspects were armed with a small pistol and other crude weapons which they used to terrorise the victim. The suspects had been out on Sh100,000 cash bail each. The case has dragged on at the Keroka law courts since September 2016. (edited by O. Owino)
