Manchester United’s stars have expressed their delight at the departure of Alexis Sanchez on a season-long loan to Inter Milan, according to The Sun. The Chilean endured a miserable spell at Old Trafford after joining from Arsenal in a swap deal with Henrikh Mkhitaryan in Juanuary 2018. Despite much fanfare upon his arrival for a salary worth around £500,000 a week, the winger scored just five goals in 45 games. His team-mates are thought to have been angered by his mammoth salary and disappointing contributions on the pitch. One player reportedly said: “He was no Messi so why pay him all that dough.” Manchester United are also reportedly subsidising around £400,00-a-week of his salary to ensure he left the club. The former Barcelona man will spend the upcoming season at the San Siro, reuniting with former Old Trafford striker Romelu Lukaku. The Belgian joined Inter Milan for £73m this summer after pushing for a departure from Manchester United.
