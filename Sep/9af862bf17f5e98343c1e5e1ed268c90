 Rongo residents in Migori are demanding justice after the killing of a 22-year-old bodaboda passenger was killed on Monday allegedly by county askaris over cess. The bodaboda rider is fighting for his life at Rongo Sub-county Hospital. One of the askaris has been arrested. His colleague is on the run. The askaris are said to have clubbed the rider and the passenger senseless for not having a sticker showing that Sh100 weekly cess had been paid, Rongo police boss Joel Kiptum said. Kiptum said the passenger died on the way to the sub-county hospital. The attack sparked outrage, with motorcycle operators blocking the Kisii-Migori road in protest. “They (rider and passenger) were stopped by county askaris at a cess collection point at Rakwaro centre. There was an altercation and the two were beaten with clubs,” Victor Ochieng, a witness said. Ochieng said the victims of the beatings were stopped and asked to produce a sticker showing payment of Sh100 weekly cess. They refused, arguing that the motorbike was private. He said the askaris were notorious for beating bodaboda operators. “We cannot allow such brutality to continue. Even police officers manning roadblocks do not handle us in this manner,” Ochieng said. South Kamagambo chief Erick Mala said the passenger succumbed to head injuries. “His body was taken to Rosewood mortuary.” Mala urged pleaded for calm as police investigated the incident. “This is an unfortunate incident and I’m urging locals to remain calm as we pursue the culprits. We are coordinating with police officers to bring other suspects to book,” he said.
