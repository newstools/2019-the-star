 The National Environment Management Authority on Wednesday closed a hospital in Ngong town for discharging waste int the environment. Trinity Care Centre was shut down following complaints from residents. Nema acting director general Mamo Mamo who led the operation said they will not hesitate to close facilities that pollute the environment. "We received information from wananchi that there was effluent being discharge into the environment. We came here to ascertain the complaint," Mamo said. He said their inspection found the facility culpable. "Our inspectors found that the hospital is in the wrong place. It is a private facility with about 10 beds," Mamo said. Proprietor Joseph Ndaba said he was shocked to have been ambushed by the authority. Ndaba said he has a contract with the Kajiado county government to destroy hospital waste. "I use my own vehicle to transport waste to the county government," Ndaba said. When asked about Nema standards, Ndaba said he was not aware of such requirements. He said a previous health care provider who operated at the premises had a licence from Nema, hence there was no need for another one. The retired civil servant said he was not solely responsible for waste generated as there were many other tenants in the building. Nema said the facility had no environmental audit as required. The authority said the facility also transported waste without a required licence. Mamo said the owners of other health facilities discharging waste to the environment have been summoned. edited by peter obuya
