Education CS George Magoha has directed that Greenfield Academy in Kwale county be closed for having poor structures. This is after a classroom in Precious Talent School in Nairobi collapsed claiming eight lives. Speaking in Kwale on Friday, Magoha asked 400 affected pupils from Greenfield to seek refuge at Umoja primary school. "Umoja public school has wonderful buildings, enough water, teachers are there and it has excess capacity that can absorb all those children from Greenfield academy," he said. Noting that crackdown on illegal structures will continue countrywide, Magoha said 1,500 officers from the ministry are checking buildings in schools. "My instruction to them is that any structure with a double-storey should be shut down immediately," Magoha said. "I move like a submarine. I would like to be going without mentioning where I am going," Magoha said. The closure of Greenfield brings the number of closed schools to four in a span of four days. On Thursday, Magoha shut down St Catherine Bombolulu Primary School in Kibra constituency for having weak structures. Magoha said the school had similarities with the collapsed classroom at Precious Talent School in Dagoretti, Nairobi County.
