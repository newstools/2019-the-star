Ten per cent of women in Mombasa are willing and ready to use contraceptives, the problem is they have no access to them. The health department aims to reach these women so that contraceptives can be easily accessible. According to the department, at least 55 per cent of women use modern contraceptives. Speaking at Tononoka grounds in Mombasa on Thursday during the World Contraceptives Day, county health director Shem Patta said women in Mombasa have accepted contraceptives. “We would like to put more effort so that we can reach these women who want to use these family planning methods but are unable to get such services," he said. The county also aims to reach schools due to the increase of teenage pregnancies. “We have seen that early pregnancies have increased in Mombasa just like in all the other counties and that is why we are trying to reach all this young people with this message,” the health director said. Some women said they fear the side effects of contraceptives and opt not to use them. “Whenever I think of using family planning methods, I fear for the worst because many of my friends complain of the side effects, one being bleeding excessively when on your menses,” Warda Hussein from Nyali said. But Patta advised women to visit clinics to get tested on which method will fit them for the best results.
