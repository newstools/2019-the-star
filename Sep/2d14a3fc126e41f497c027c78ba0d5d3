A witness in Dennis Itumbi's forgery case has asked the court to allow him to withdraw from the case citing threats to his life. Samwel Gateri has told the court that the DCI has been forcing him to make a confession in admitting that he personally knows Itumbi and deputy president William Ruto. In an application filed under urgency, Gateri says that he was arrested on July 2 by the DCI and the officers forcibly seized and took his cellphones, national identity and other personal items. "The officers thereafter told me that I was under arrest and that they would go ahead and execute me if I did not confirm that I had a telephone conversation with his excellency the deputy president and that Dennis Itumbi was my link with the DP", Gateri said in the application. He added that the officers threatened that they would take him to a high ranking security personnel in government so that he could be dealt with. He was in police custody for more than 24 hours but was later released. Gateri claims that he knows Itumbi from public sources and not personally. He wants his confiscated items returned unconditionally since he is unable to carry out any transactions without his national identity card. "I am currently under intense pressure since the officers threatened me and I have even faced an attempted kidnapping, therefore, my life is in danger," he added. The case had come up for pre-trial conference before Itumbi's lawyer made the application. The prosecution requested to be given more time to the application. Chief magistrate Martha Mutuku directed the matter to be mentioned on Tuesday without the appearance of the accused person.
