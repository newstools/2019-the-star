National Under-20 Rising Stars have settled for a two-all draw with Tanzania in their second Cecafa Group B tournament match played at the Fufa Technical area in Jinja Uganda. Kenya beat Zanzibar 5-0 in the opening match last weekend but surrendered their advantage twice to share spoils with Tanzania who thrashed Ethiopia 4-0 in their opener. Prior to the match, coach Stanley Okumbi made two changes in his squad bringing in Nzoia Sugar centre half Brain Wepo and AFC Leopards striker Austin Odhiambo to replace Alvin Ochieng and John Njuguna respectively. Odhiambo justified his inclusion in the team with the opener in the 28th minute, dribbling past his marker to slot the ball past the goalkeeper. Odhiambo doubled his tally in the tournament as he was on target in the opener. Tanzania levelled minutes to the breather from an Andrew Simchimba's well-struck free-kick but Kariobangi Sharks forward Patrick Otieno regained the lead eight minutes after the restart to open his goal account with the team. Abdul Suleiman restored parity in the 56th minute.Â  Kenya will play Ethiopia in the final group stage match while Tanzania will be up against Zanzibar.
