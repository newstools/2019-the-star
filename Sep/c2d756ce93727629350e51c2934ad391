West Pokot Senator Samuel Poghisio has praised the recent cross-border peace agreement signed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Uganda's Yoweri Museveni. The agreement is aimed at promoting peace and development among Turkana, Pokot and Karamojong communities. Poghisio said that the projects will help reduce tensions over shared resources such as water and pasture. The 'Cross-Border Sustainable Peace and Development' initiative seeks to end hostilities among the three neighbouring communities. He said the peace and development programme will transform the border region from a conflict zone to an area of progress, development and wealth. Poghisio said that the projects will help open up the region and fast-track other developments in the region. “The projects will help cement peace between the Pokot, Karamojong and Turkana communities that have been conflicting for many decades,” he said.  The senator asked investors to invest in the region because security had been strengthened in the region. He also asked members of the county assembly to perform their oversight role diligently to ensure that funds are submitted to the county are not misused. “County assembly needs to ensure county funds  are used for the budgeted functions so that residents can get value for their money,” he said.
