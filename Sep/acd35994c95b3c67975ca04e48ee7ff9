 Kenya needs leaders who fear God for the country to be great, Wiper boss Kalonzo Musyoka said on Sunday. Unfortunately, everybody seeking the presidency claims to be God-fearing. "Let us uphold integrity. The only problem I have is that everyone will say they are fearful of God," Kalonzo said. The former Vice-President was addressing congregants during the official launch of AIC Karen chapel. He said leaders who fear God will always seek guidance from God. "Leaders should take a silent morning reading even a verse of the Bible and they will face the day very well," Kalonzo said. Africa, according to the Wiper leader, will be great if leaders learn to say they are sorry for mistakes. "Leaders do make tremendous mistakes when in leadership. But let us remember them when they do tremendous contribution," Kalonzo said in reference to the fallen Zimbabwe leader Robert Mugabe. Kalonzo, who attended Mugabe's funeral on Saturday, said South African President CyrilÂ  Ramaposa apologised for the attacks on non-locals. He called on Kenyans to stop holding grudges for long. Former Machakos gubernatorial aspirant Wavinya Ndeti said Kalonzo attends church service unlike many other leaders who only go to church for rallies. "We are in the right place. God's time is the best," Ndeti said. Ndeti said Kenya "seriously needs a leader who fears God." "Look at what is happening....people kill their husbands before throwing them in septic tanks," she said in an apparent reference to the murder of Dutch billionaire Tob Cohen. The politician said Kalonzo is ripe to take over the country's presidency and that he will serve the country well. "People have interests and we know. It does not matter what people say about you," Ndeti told Kalonzo. Others at the function included Makueni MP Daniel Manzo, former Tetu MP aspirant Ann Kanyi, Machakos MCA Hellen Ndeti and AIC Bishop Silas Yegos.
