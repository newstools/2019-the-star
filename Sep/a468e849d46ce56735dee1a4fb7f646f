A group of parents on Friday camped outside a Kibera court and demanded the release of Precious Talent Academy owner Moses Wainaina. Eight children were on Monday killed when part of the school collapsed. Several others were injured. Wainaina was arrested on Thursday. The parents accused the state of using the accident to intimidated and harass Wainaina. The said the incident was an accident. They accused Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha of ordering the transfer of their children  to other "non-performing schools" in Ng'ong. The parents said that the CS does not have good intentions because their children will have to trek for long before reaching school. "In Ng’ong Forest area, children will walk many kilometers to school. They can be attacked by wild animal and rapists. We better keep our children at home," said Amos (not his real name). He said that Magoha does not have any child in a public school and should not dictate to them. Amos urged the CS to set up tents and temporary shelters to allow their children to get back in class. "If you tell us to take our children to Jamhuri School, what do you mea? There is nothing good for them there in terms of quality education,’’ he said. Another parent said that she had a child at Jamhuri Primary who got pregnant due to rampant indiscipline in the school. Ann Lavenda, another parent, said that most of the pupils who had passed in the hands of the accused teacher have succeeded in their lives. "I just want to say that may God assist teacher Moses. He had done a lot of good things for our children. This was an accident and we wonder why he is being stressed,’’ she said. The parents spoke after Kibera chief magistrate Joyce Gandani declined to release Wainaina on bail. Gandani had ordered that he be detained at Kabete police station for 15 days before his bond application. Gandani ruled that the it was catastrophic to lose a single child in a public school.
