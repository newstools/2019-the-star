Residents and motorists using Mukuuri-Kathande-Kianjokoma road in Embu East subcounty have threatened to hold demonstrations over the poor state of the road. They gave a one-week ultimatum to the government to repair the road or they will hold protests. The residents said the road has been neglected by both the county and the national governments and is impassable during the rainy season. Speaking at a meeting on Sunday, the residents said the road had developed huge cracks and potholes, putting the lives of motorists at risk. "There is a huge hole at Kanjiri corner. It is along a hilly sharp corner and we fear motorists using the road might fall into it. This road is a death trap," said Njeru Ngari, a resident of Mukuuri. The residents accused leaders of failing to lobby for projects in the area. "We've nominated and elected county leaders within our vicinity, some who use this road daily. They have turned a blind eye to it. Even lobbying for it to be murramed is none of their business," another resident said. Motorists said they are now forced to repair their vehicles and motorcycles often. "It has become very costly for me to maintain my motorbike. I am forced to take it to the garage more than twice a week," Silas Munyi said. Milk transporters said they have incurred losses during accidents while using the road. "Sometimes, demonstration is the only language our leaders understand. We will be forced to go that route if nothing is done within the course of the week," a resident said.
