The county government of Meru is contemplating  a ban on planting of eucalyptus trees, which destroy rivers. Titus Wamae, a policy advocacy officer at Wetlands International, an NGO partnering with counties to formulate water and irrigation policies, said they are in the final stages of drafting a policy to combat ecosystem degradation and end conflicts. "The Constitution allows a framework at the devolved units level on water policy. Water resources issues are salient issues that need a specific policy to enhance conservation," he said. The policy will be aimed at ending conflicts among water users, combat illegal logging and degradation of water systems. "We started supporting Meru county to establish a water and irrigation policy. Last year,  we held inception work, then collected views for a draft policy and now we are holding consultative meetings with community conservationists and key national and county government technical officials and agencies," Wamae said. A task force is drafting the policy and we will be validated before October 18, when Governor Kiraitu Murungi has invited stakeholders for a water conference. He said the comprehensive policy will support the county to allocate resources for ecosystem conservation, support communities managing water resources, ensure supply of clean and safe water and conserve biodiversity. Terry Kimonye, the county government assistant director of economic planning, said the policy will combat pollution, water abstraction offer directions for the water sector. Eric Mutwiri, an economist, said poor water management is a threat to food security and economic growth. "We intend to declare eucalyptus trees a threat to  livelihoods, " Mutwiri said.
