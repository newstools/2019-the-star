Despite losing their opening match against Ulinzi Stars on Saturday, Kisumu All Stars coach Henry Omino says he is confident the team will post positive results in the top flight. All Stars, making their debut in the top flight league, went down 2-0 to the soldiers at Moi Stadium, Kisumu and yesterday Omino assured fans and sponsors that they will improve going forward, with KCB next in line. “We played well, especially in the first half. Conceding the first goal immediately after the restart unsettled the boys and they didn't recover. There is no need to panic because it’s too early,” said the veteran coach. He added: “It was the first time for some of the players to play before such a big crowd. However, I'm confident they will get used to this with time. The players must improve their concentration and confidence.” Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o and Sports minister Achia Alai graced the game. The team is sponsored by Kisumu County Government. Omino has two weeks to prepare the team's next game against KCB on September 14 in Machakos. “I'm aware KCB has won against Sony and they recruited heavily but I'm confident we shall get a positive result,” added the veteran coach. He added that three of his new signings did not play in the game because of injuries while one is awaiting clearance by the football governing body Football Kenya Federation. “I expect the trio to be ready for the KCB game. We missed them in the Ulinzi game,” said the former Western Stima coach. Ulinzi Stars coach Benjamin Nyangweso, however, praised All Stars. “Lack of experience at this level cost them. However, this is a good side,” said Nyangweso.
