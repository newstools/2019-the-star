Kenya Airways pilots have lashed out at the airline's management blaming them for the massive losses the airline has experienced over the past few years. The Kenya Airlines Pilots Association (Kalpa) on Tuesday said KQ would still have reported losses even if pilots gave their services for free. KQ management last week blamed the current CBA for allowing pilots to call in sick without proof, leading to numerous cancellations, and high salaries paid to the pilots for its financial woes. "KQ should stop looking for scapegoats in pilots. Should pilots offer services for free, KQ would still declare losses," Kalpa general secretary NyagahÂ  Murithi said. The association also blamed the KQ management for increasing frequencies without having the right crew size. This has contributed to frequent flight cancellations. They now want the government to address the pilot and crew shortage at the airline. Meanwhile, Kalpa says it supports nationalisation of the airline if it will save KQ. "If you are going to nationalise, it should not be tied down like other state corporations," Nyagah said.
