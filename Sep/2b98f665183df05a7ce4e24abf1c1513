The court ruled that Wairimu be allowed to attend the postmortem of Cohen. Wairimu, a suspect in her husband's killing, wore a pink long blouse with a black trouser. Wairimu walked with her navy blue sweater wrapped around her neck as she sauntered into the Chiromo mortuary compound under tight security. She was accompanied by her lawyer Philip Murgor. Also present was Cohen's sister Gabrielle Van Straten accompanied by her husband. Straten who wore a cream blouse and black pants was seen shedding tears compelling her to wear dark shades. Judge Stella Mutuku ordered that Wairimu be escorted by police from Lang'ata Women's prison to Chiromo mortuary where the exercise is set to be conducted. Her lawyer Philip Murgor made the application for the order on Tuesday. Wairimu, regarded as a prime suspect, will take a plea on September 26.
