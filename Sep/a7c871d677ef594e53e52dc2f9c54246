Payment for health services and drugs in county hospitals and health centres will henceforth be paid for digitally. Pay bill numbers have been introduced in Pumwani, Mama Lucy, Mutuini and Mbagathi hospitals. The same applies at Ngara, Huruma Lions, Ruai, Eastleigh and Lunga Lunga health centres. The pay bill mode of payment – effective from September 15 – is aimed phases out cash payments to curb bribery and graft in hospitals. County's Chief officer for Health Mohammed Sahal on September 10 told medical superintendents to ensure that the pay bill platforms are up and running from this week. Digital payment, he said, will protect patients from irregular charges and enhance transparency. "We have decided to end any form of cash payments. The pay bill numbers will help the county monitor the payment process," Sahal said. Early this month, the county government collaborated with UAP Old Mutual in a Sh5 million Queue Management System to manage queues in hospitals. The system gathers real-time data about the service, wait time and customers. Under the audio-visual system, which starts next month, patients will pick ticket numbers from vending machines. They will be called in as per ticket number. Digital payment makes access to services easy and fast. Mama Lucy Medical Superintendent Musa Muhamed confirmed that the paybill mode of payment has started. "We have seen change and this means that there will be smooth running in the facility and cases of suspicious handling of money will end," he said.
