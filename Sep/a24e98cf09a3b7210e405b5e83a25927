Talanta coach Juma Abdalla reckons his team has what it takes to challenge for promotion this season after seeing his side come from behind to defeat Northern Wanderers 3-1 in a National Super League match at the Camp Toyoyo Stadium yesterday. “We have managed 10 points in only four matches and this shows we are on the right track as far as our objectives are concerned. I was happy with the response of my players after going behind so early to a team that was seeking to prove a point,” said Juma. Against all expectations, Wanderers who have now lost all their four matches took the lead in the 10th minute through Farah Kader. They could not, however, hold onto their lead for long as Anthony Gichu volleyed Talanta level six minutes later. The tide changed in favour of Talanta and their dominance paid off in the 24th minute when Abdul Wahab turned the game around with a low drive past erratic Kinoti Mwiti in the Wanderers goal. Brian Juma’s superb lob finished the game as a contest 10 minutes before the break. The game had to endure some farcical moment at the start of the second half when the match officials refused to restart the game, demanding that Talanta pay their share of the referee wages before the game could go on. With the federation ostensibly unable to pay match officials, clubs agreed to pay Sh10,000 each to officials in charge of their games —something that Talanta only did after a long delay—much to the chagrin of Noordin Badel, the Wanderers coach “Why should the match be delayed because one team has failed to meet its obligation as agreed in pre-match. This is totally unprofessional and it should not be repeated,” he remonstrated with the officials. Wanderers remain rooted at the foot of the NSL table after four matches and finished the game with ten men after Albert Lemantile and Warsame Yusuf were given their marching orders.
