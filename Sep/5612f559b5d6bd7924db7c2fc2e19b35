Gareth Southgate was four years old when his father Clive took him to Gigg Lane. The England manager was born in Watford but lived in Bury for a few of his earliest years. It was there, in a game against the town of his birth in the Old Third Division, that Southgate experienced his first taste of football. April 12, 1975. Southgate remembers it well. “Bury against Watford. Derek Spence scored the winner. A header. It sticks in your mind. I don’t think I watched much of the game as I was running up and down the terraces with my dad probably clipping me around the ear to sit and watch! 44 years later, Southgate has the most prestigious managerial job in the country while Bury are a club on the verge of extinction, the first club since Maidstone United in 1992 to be expelled from the Football League. In financial turmoil, Bury’s hopes of survival were extinguished when a late takeover bid fell through. Meanwhile, neighbours Bolton were only saved at the 11th hour. Southgate worries Bury will not be the last. He said: “My first thoughts are with people who have lost their jobs because the human element of that is that the players at that level have much more financial difficulty than players in the leagues above. With the staff, it’s like any other business that goes under, that’s a massive blow for the families.” “For the supporters, for whom the club is part of the community and a real sense of identity, it’s a tragic story. It worries me and I think it could be something we see a bit more frequently.” “I’m not sure the game is sustainable in its spending, outside of the money that comes in from the television. So, that is each club’s responsibility to manage their finances and the decision-making as a club has not been the right thing.” The financial landscape of English football suggests that Bury and Bolton are not alone. Sixty-one of the 92 football clubs in the Premier League and the EFL made a net loss in their most recent accounts, totalling nearly £600m.
