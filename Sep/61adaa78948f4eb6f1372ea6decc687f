Former Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe will be buried at the National Heroes Acre, a national hero monument in Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital city. But what’s this National Heroes Acre? Also known as Heroes Acre, this is a 57-acre in a town located about 40km south of Harare in the province of Mashonaland West. It’s where exceptional men and women, who died in the liberation struggle during the Rhodesian Bush War, were buried. This was later extended to other Zimbabweans who, in one way or another, are considered heroes and heroines.The Heroes Acre site takes the shape of an AK-47, one of the most important firearms used in the struggle for independence. The graves are supposed to appear like magazines. The bronze statue of the Unknown Soldier towers majestically here. It symbolises the final resting site for Zimbabweans who sacrificed their lives for their freedom and independence. Behind the Unknown Soldier’s statue, an eternal flame burns at the top of a 40-meter tower, as a far-flung, visible from a far distance. This flame represents Zimbabweans’ ambition to become a free and autonomous country and symbolises the flame of self-government in April 1980. The flame also stands for the spirit of all the individuals that died during the fight. Near the Acre’s entrance is a museum dedicated to African nationalism and the anti-colonial war, showcasing artefacts, images and other paraphernalia from the war.   The National Heroes Acre is the pride of the people of Zimbabwe. For those whose remains are laid to rest here, it is a sign of courage and selflessness.Among other iconic figures buried in the area is former Vice President Joshua Nkomo.
