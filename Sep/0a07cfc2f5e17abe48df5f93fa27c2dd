A new four-dose malaria vaccine campaign has been launched in Kakamega county.  “The entire vaccine is to be administered in four jabs: at the age of six, seven, nine and finally 24 months,” he said. Vaccinations will be provided in all health centres and hospitals. Malaria is endemic in Kakamega, Bungoma and counties in the  Nyanza region. The vaccine can prevent four out of 10 malaria infections and prevent severe malaria. It should be used in conjunction with treated bed nets, indoor spraying and removing stagnant water. Kenya is the third country after Ghana and Malawi to pilot the vaccine, which has been proved to be safe and effective. Malaria is among the leading causes of infant mortality in Western and Nyanza regions. All parents were urged to have their children vaccinated. “The launch of the malaria vaccine marks a milestone in combating a disease that is responsible for many infant deaths,” Dr Andere said.
