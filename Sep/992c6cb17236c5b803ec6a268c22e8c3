Long hitter Dismas Indiza has rued failing to win the prestigious Uganda Open title. Despite smashing the course record of 9 under par 63 on the penultimate round and moving 22 places up the competitive leader board, Indiza expressed his disappointment for failing to defend the title he lost to Zambian Muthiya Madalitso. “The plan this year was to defend the title but this became a lot more difficult in the first two rounds when I played a 73 and 76. I picked myself up on penultimate stage with a 63 but one over on the last round nipped my dreams in the bud. It’s going to be a long season of the Safari Tour before the Kenya Open, so hopefully, we’ll be back in Uganda to reclaim the title,” said Indiza who was among the four Kenyans in the top ten. Simon Ngige wrapped up his campaign in sixth, Riz Charania tied for seventh while struggling Greg Snow rediscovered his form and posted a closing 66 to move to T10. Indiza is the most successful Kenyan at the Uganda Open having lifted the coveted title in 2007, 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2018. He, however, admitted that his nine under par 63 score on Friday came as a pleasant surprise. “I have always played well in this event. So it really hurts when you fail to spackle in an event you have really dominated. A lion lives to fight another day,” said Indiza, who finished fourth. Zambian Muthiya Madalitso racked up his second Uganda Open professional title, edging Zimbabwe’s Charamba Tongoona by four strokes at the Lake Victoria Serena Golf Resort & Spa course on Saturday. He ended the 72 hole showdown with a score of 279, nine-under-par. This year’s event went down in history as Uganda’s first Safari Pro Tour event attracting a record number of foreign entrants gunning for a lion’s share of the US$50,000 cash prize.
