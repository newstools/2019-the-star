Mombasa’s North Coast insecurity is getting out of hand even after the former security chiefs were replaced. More than 20 juvenile boys attacked Nyali, Maweni, Kongowea and VOK residents between 3am and 6am on Saturday and Sunday. During the day, police patrols are intensified but we don’t see patrols during the night, something the gangs have probably taken note of. Once the police and national flags are lowered at 6pm, it seems like our security personnel go to a deep slumber and leave the field open for homegrown terror groups to take control.  Mombasa
