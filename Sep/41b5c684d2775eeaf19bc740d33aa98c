Kenya Lionesses will face either Colombia or Brazil in a Rugby World Cup qualifier after finishing second in the Africa qualifiers. The dates of the match are yet to be announced by World Rugby. The winner of the match will head to the repechage where they will meet the winners of the other continents. Kenya finished second at the last month's African Rugby World Cup qualifiers last month, where they beat Uganda and Madagascar 37-5 and 35-5 respectively before losing to hosts South Africa 39-0 in the final. Kenya Lionesses coach Felix Oloo yesterday said the team needs two to three build-up matches, preferably against European opposition if they are to qualify for the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand in 2021. "If we can get a couple of games under our belt, then we can we go to the match against the South American team full of confidence and well tested,” added Oloo. Oloo said the team will have to improve in the forward positions especially the tight five following the defeat to South Africa in the final. “We were a bit light in that area in the final and the tight five play is the foundation you build in rugby 15's. We are therefore going back to the drawing board in that regard,” he added. Oloo was optimistic about his side's chance of qualification to the world extravaganza in two years time. “We have a very ambitious youthful squad that is  willing to learn and if we can invest in the team and give them the right exposure, then the sky is the limit for this girls,” noted Oloo Oloo said the team will resume training once the World Rugby communicates the date for the qualifier against Colombia or Brazil” We are still waiting for the date once we get it we are back in training” added Oloo The tactician was delighted to see the growth of the women's game in the last couple of years. “ I'm delighted when I see Kenya Cup clubs and others having women's teams. This augurs well for the future of our various national teams and it gives us good numbers."
