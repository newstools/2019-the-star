Butali are motivated with their employers’ assurance that they will cater for their participation in the forthcoming African Club Championship in Egypt if they win the men’s Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) Premier League. The league leaders and champions have in the past three editions given the event a wide berth due to financial constraints despite winning the league. Butali’s defender Constance Wakhura said the prospect of participating in the December event is the main reason behind the team’s hunger to set records this season. The national team captain was speaking after another classy performance on Sunday, thanks to a 2-0 victory against over hard fighting United States International University. The former Strathmore University player, who is known for his drag-flicking heroics, scored twice in his speciality in the recently concluded Olympic qualifiers. However, his efforts were not enough to help the team book a ticket to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The tough tackler has helped the league leaders maintain consistency, conceding only six goals in 11 matches.  They comfortably sit at the summit with 27 points ahead Wazalendo with 26. Wakhura said players are driven to outperform themselves in the league because it is part of the team’s preparation strategy ahead of the Africa show in December.
