Australia ran in four second-half tries as they fought back to beat Fiji in their opening 2019 World Cup match. The 2015 finalists were trailing until halfway into the second half before hooker Silatolu Latu went over for two tries inside five minutes. Peceli Yato's try gave Fiji an early 8-0 lead, and a shock looked possible when Waisea Nayacalevu scored under the posts early in the second half . But a cluster of tries late in the game put Australia firmly in control. Yato was outstanding, but was forced off after only 25 minutes with a head injury following a collision with Australia winger Reece Hodge. Australia had looked to be finding their feet when Michael Hooper crossed for a try following Yato's opener, and after Hodge scored in the corner the teams went into half-time with Fiji leading 14-12. But when Nayacalevu latched onto a loose pass on the halfway line to sprint home just three minutes into the second half, Fiji's first win over Australia since 1954 was a distinct possibility. However, Latu's first international tries, both scored from line-outs, settled Australia nerves before Samu Kerevi and Marika Koroibete put the two-time World Cup winners comfortably clear.
