The quarantine notice issued by the Kisii government two months ago to control the foot-and-mouth disease is still in force, Agriculture executive Esman Onsarigo has said. He said they have embarked on the second round of vaccination against the disease in Nyaribari Chache and Nyaribari Masaba, where cases have been reported. An outbreak of the killer disease has since been reported in the neighbouring counties of Migori and Narok. "I, therefore, order for the immediate closure of all livestock markets in the affected areas until the situation is controlled," Onsarigo said in his office. He added that affected animals must be isolated to avoid spread.Â Onsarigo said the county government undertook a vaccination exercise in the Narok- Kisii, Migori-Kisii and Homabay- Kisii borders as part of preventive measures against the disease. He was accompanied by Fisheries, Livestock and Veterinary Services chief officer Alphanus Mokaya and several directors. (Edited by F'Orieny)
