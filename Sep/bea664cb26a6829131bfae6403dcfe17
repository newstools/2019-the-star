The video of a schoolboy spewing expletives has rightly confirmed that the society is ‘eating itself’ morally. The young boy is obviously doing what he has seen done and sanctioned by the adults around him. While his words are to be condemned, we equally need to examine how we have contributed to such behaviour in our society. While it is therapeutic to express one’s emotions, it is not acceptable to express our feelings in a way that might hurt others. The boy wanted to show what he felt about a schoolmate but he chose to go public thereby exposing the recipient in a bad light. Isn’t this what our leaders do every day? We are treated to an array of political tantrums that border on absurd and as a country, we celebrate or get hurt depending on the political divide that we fall to. The case of politicians openly referring to national leaders as ‘mshenzi’, ‘mwizi’, among others have obviously reached our young generation through the media. Children cannot be blamed for doing what leaders we look up to are doing on a daily basis. Whereas such behaviour and speeches can be tolerated during campaigns, it is completely reckless to witness the same during such serious activities as during debates in the assemblies, religious functions and even funerals. Our leaders fighting in Parliament, in churches and during funerals are almost becoming the norm. How do we blame children when even a bishop is still trending for using unacceptable language on his congregants? Yet we are the first lot to lash out at the minor for repeating what he saw in the media. Before blaming the boy, let’s check ourselves. Let’s review what we do and say in front of them and on social media.  Bomet
