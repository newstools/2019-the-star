Former chairman of the defunct Olkejuado County Council Daniel Ole Muyaa is dead. Muyaa died on Wednesday at 75. The family is, however, yet to reveal the cause of death. Muyaa will be remembered for his bravery in 2002 after fiercely taking on then Vice President George Saitoti in his own backyard. A friend turn foe, Muyaa would take the country by surprise after declaring war on his lifelong friend. The prominent Maasai elder was born in 1944 in Kiu village in Mashuru division, Kajiado District. He attended Kiu Primary School where he did the Common Entrance Examination, before enrolling in the National Youth Service. On Wednesday, leaders poured their condolences to the family, friends of Mzee Muyaa, as a respected and influential community leader. “Mzee Ole Muyaa was a fierce champion of the rights of minority groups and made invaluable contributions to their advancement, especially in education and representation. He advocated for peace, cohesion and harmonious relationships among communities,” Deputy President William Ruto said in his Twitter account. In 1983, Muyaa joined politics after capturing Kitengela ward in Kajiado in a by-election following a petition. He was an energetic booster, present at every Saitoti function. Muyaa remained loyal to Saitoti and was among those who defended the Vice-President in 1994 when he was attacked by William ole Ntimama. He later became a fierce critic of Saitoti.
