Woman Fide Master Sasha Mwongeli believes less knowledge on speed chess was the major contributor to her crushing out of the title race at the just concluded All African Games in Rabat, Morocco. Team Kenya finished 14th out of a total twenty countries with threats Egypt, Algeria and Zimbabwe finishing in the medal brackets respectively. WFM Mwongeli, 23, finished 11th in the rapid women category with her counterpart Joyce Nyaruai settling for position 13th after nine rounds of play. In blitz, Nyaruai was 12th and Mwongeli finished in position 26. Mwongeli said: “The Games have been good and challenging at the same time. My teammates and I displayed our level best and unfortunately, none of us got into the medal bracket,” “Personally, the lack of knowledge in speed chess is what I feel, let me down the most in striking my goal of a podium finish,” she added. The mathematical prodigy intends to change tactics once back at the Chess Kenya Academy, to work on her speed. She alluded that the All African Games gave her a better perspective of how she plays and will work with her coach to improve her skill. “It was a good experience and I will now focus on ameliorating my weaknesses. I have earned experience from this extravaganza, and am sure with my effort and assistance from the coach I will be able to get to a better place in future events,” continued Mwongeli. John Mukabi, the team manager echoed Mwongeli's sentiments about speed chess saying: “Lack of experience and blundering in time pressure gave the team a run for their money. The Games were not the classical time limits. Rapids were 15 minutes with an additional three seconds, contrasted to the normal 10-60 minutes while Blitz, which is normally at 10 minutes was timed at five with an additional three seconds each side.” In the men's category, Gohil Mehul finished 26th in rapid open category with teammate Ricky Sang at 33rd. They also finished 29th and 3oth respectively in the blitz open.
