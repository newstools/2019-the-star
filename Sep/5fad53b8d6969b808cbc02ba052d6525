World 1,500m champions Elijah Manang’oi has withdrawn from Team Kenya to the 2019 World Championships in Doha, Qatar through injury. Manang’oi has been nursing an ankle injury picked during training, which even forced him out of the national trials last week, though he was eligible for his title defence through a wild card. Through a post on his Facebook account, Manang’oi said: “Sad that I am not able to defend my 1,500m title in Doha WC (World Championships) due to an ankle injury I picked in training. I had no choice. We have to save the carrier for the sake of the Olympic year (2019 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan)." "It’s not my fault. But God knows the reason why. All my fans in the world, continue to have faith in me. All the best to my teammates, world silver medalist Timothy Cheruiyot and my younger brother, world junior champion George Manang’oi and Ronald Kwemoi. Bring it back home guys. To all competitors and event organisers, make Doha a fun-filled and successful event. See you next season. God Bless you all.”
