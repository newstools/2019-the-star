Bandari’s 2-0 win over US Ben Guerdane of Tunisia in the Caf Confederations Cup will inspire them to convincingly triumph in their subsequent matches. Prior to the match played on Saturday at the Moi Stadium Kasarani, Bandari had gone for six matches without a win but according to their team manager Wilson Oburu, their last week’s performance injected massive impetus ahead of their next matches. The dockers, who had part of their pre-season preparations in South Africa, had drawn their last six matches but goals from Yema Mwama and Abdalla Hassan broke the jinx to the relieve of the technical bench who had admitted to being worried of their blunt striking force. The duo were injury doubts before the match but netted to give their side a healthy advantage ahead of the return leg set for in Tunis in two weeks time. Oburu noted that the win will boost the confidence of the striking department as well as increased their chances of qualifying to the next round of the continental tournament. “We had struggled to win matches but the win is a new dawn for us. Scoring was our major undoing and I am glad we managed to end the winless streak against a strong opponent. We had tirelessly worked to see our strikers hit top form and its working at long last. Scoring against Guerdane will boost their morale going forward.” With Bandari pencilled to travel to hostile North Africa for the return leg, Oburu is not scared of the unfavourable football environment. “We will come up with the best strategy for the return leg which we know will be difficult for us. We are not afraid of their antics or their attack-minded style of play now that they will be seeking to overturn the deficit.” Oburu, meanwhile, has rallied the club to scoop their first Kenya Premier League win in the ongoing season when they host Zoo Kericho tomorrow at Mbaraki Stadium. The match was initially planned for the weekend but was shelved to allow the coastal side to honour the continental encounter.
