Kakamega MCAs on Thursday blocked embattled speaker Morris Buluma from presiding over the assembly sitting, insisting that they had suspended him over neglect of duty. They started the process of removing him from office by drafting an impeachment motion, which they served to the office of the clerk before leaving the assembly. One MCA was injured after another hit him with a walking crutch on the head. Butali/Chegulo MCA Kevin Mahelo said that a nominated member hit him when he tried to stop her from attacking a fellow nominated Rep. “She was given one of lists for signatures of the impeachment motion to sign and instead tore it into pieces. When a fellow nominated MCA asked why she had she tore the list, she charged at her and when I intervened she hit me on the head,” Mahelo said. Mahelo reported the matter to the Kakamega central police station. Trouble started when the speaker walked in the chambers and majority of members remained standing to protest his presence in the house after they suspended him for three months for absconding duty and disrespecting them on Tuesday. One member requested to speak on a point of inquiry but was not allowed with speaker saying that the point of inquiry would only be raised after the business of the day was complete. They said that the speaker’s decisions in the county assembly service board do not benefit members who elected him.
