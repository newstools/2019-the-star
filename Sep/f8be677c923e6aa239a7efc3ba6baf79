In the process, they got information about three suspiciously looking men suspected to be part of a gang that terrorise locals,” Mukuusi said. He spoke to the Star at Mlolongo police station on Tuesday. The police boss said when confronted by the officers and ordered to surrender, the three took off on a motorbike. “The officers gave chase. Some of the officers took motorbikes while the rest used a police land cruiser and drove to Mlolongo phase three estate at Diamond area,” he added. “Two of the three passengers alighted from the bodaboda. One of them drew a firearm before the officers engaged them, two were fatally injured while the other and a cyclist sped off on the motorbike." Mukuusi said police recovered a mini-brown pistol of serial number EP 17103977 with a magazine parked with four rounds of ammunition. He added that two more bullets were recovered from the thugs' bodies by City mortuary attendants. The two bullets found in one of the corpses made the number of bullets recovered from them to six.

He said police had launched a manhunt on the suspects who flee from the scene.
