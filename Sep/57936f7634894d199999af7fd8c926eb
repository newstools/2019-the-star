For the first time in the history of the 'Charlie’s Angels' franchise, the film will be directed by a woman, Elizabeth Banks. It will hit theatres this November. The new Angels will move to the beat of Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Lana Del Rey as Republic Records and Sony Pictures Entertainment release their song “Don’t Call Me Angel (Charlie’s Angels)” and the song’s official music video. The track, which features co-writing credits from all three of the artistes, was recently featured in the film’s trailer and is the lead single from the upcoming 'Charlie’s Angels' (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack). Banks said, “It was important to me to kick off 'Charlie’s Angels' with a huge female-powered anthem driven by a big voice – but to get three of the biggest voices out there? It’s a dream come true!"
