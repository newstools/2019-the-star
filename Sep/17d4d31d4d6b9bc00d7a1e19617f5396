The Kenya Magistrates and Judicial Association has urged Kenyans to reject toxic and unproven allegations against the Judiciary and Chief Magistrate David Maraga. "Kenya is treading on a very dangerous path by attempting to emasculate the Judiciary, which in the recent past has now been extended to levelling unsubstantiated accusations against the Hon Chief Justice David Maraga," the statement read. This comes after protesters stormed Maragaâ€™s meeting at the Sarova Whitesands in Mombasa on Thursday last week. The protesters claimed that corrupt judges are being protected and accused the Judiciary of protecting drug lords and corruption. Maraga told the protesters to table any evidence they had against any judicial officer who they accuse of being corrupt. "Do you have any memorandum you have written? I cannot address your issues without a memorandum," the CJ told the protesters. Kenyans have been urged to respect Maraga's office as he is the head of one arm of government as "He holds a very important office in the society that must be protected at all costs."
