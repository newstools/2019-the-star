Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro was on Monday night arrested in Murang'a over a fracas caused at a church on Sunday. He was accompanied by his lawyer and Murang'a Senator Irungu Kangata. County Criminal Investigations officer Julius Rutere  had earlier urged Nyoro to surrender to the nearest police station. The MP had caused a fracas in a Murang'a church and accused nominated MP Maina Kamanda of undermining him and constantly telling him that he will be politically destroyed should he not leave Tanga Tanga. During the church service, the MP refused to hand over the microphone to Kamanda who was a guest, insisting that he should have been the one to invite guests as the area MP. But Kamanda insisted that the MPs in attendance were his guests. An exchange ensued between members of Kieleweke and Tanga Tanga groups. The police later tried to arrest the MP outside the church, but he was shielded by supporters.
