The history we have as pertains to accidents that could otherwise have been managed promptly is appalling. It worries that we didn’t learn a lesson from the Solai Dam case that claimed the lives of 48 Kenyans. Neither did we learn a thing from the Huruma tragedy that equally went down with the lives of at least seven individuals. The latest tragedy that befell the pupils of Precious Talent leaves us with more questions on what really ails the country. It is unfortunate, immoral and unethical for the owner of the premise to continue holding children in such a dangerous structure. We are so pretentious seeming to care so much when tragedy befalls us but we are not as ready to prevent the occurrence of such tragedies. Every time an accident occurs, it ignites our humanity and invokes mercy in almost all of us. The problem is how fast we forget. The media forgets to follow up on the affected to know the course their lives have taken after the tragedy. Citizens forget that we are responsible for the wellbeing of those closest to us especially children and other vulnerable groups. We forget that we can save a life by raising an alarm. It is common for a neighbour to be clobbered to death by their spouses without anyone questioning the habit. Before those pupils died, the information is that the classes were not in safe conditions. Even with all these signs, pupils were still allowed to occupy them and learn normally. It worries more that teachers accessed these classes and taught as usual. Let the agencies deemed with regulatory and management of key sectors act seriously. If such authorities as the National Construction Authority don’t swing to action, let us all be prepared to mourn lives year after year.  Kakamega
