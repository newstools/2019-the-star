Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham are reportedly set to make their moves for Juventus star Paulo Dybala in the January transfer window. The Argentine international had attracted heavy interest from both clubs late on in the summer window but PSG could not sell Neymar to fund the move, while Spurs could not agree personal terms. But according to Italian publication Tuttosport, the two sides ‘aren’t giving up’ in their pursuit of the 25-year-old and will make their moves this January. Despite staying in Turin this summer, Dybala has only played 14 minutes of Serie A football in two matches so far this term. Juventus looked at swapping Dybala for Romelu Lukaku while he was at Manchester United but the Belgium striker eventually signed for Inter Milan in a £73m (Sh9bn)  deal. Dybala will be desperate for plenty of minutes when the Italian giants travel to Fiorentina on Saturday afternoon in Serie A.
