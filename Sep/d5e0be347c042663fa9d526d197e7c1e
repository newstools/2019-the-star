The government has been asked to include ICT in teachers colleges. Technology is critical in preparing young people for careers, Jerome Morrissey, the CEO of Global E-Schools and Communities Initiative said in Juja on Saturday. He spoke during the graduation of 20 school heads from Kiambu earmarked for ICT integration. “There is a problem in a lot of countries in the West about initial teacher education. The truth is that a lot of teacher colleges have been incredibly too slow in incorporating technology in training,” he said. Morrissey said each year teachers come out of college without knowledge of technology and it is not helping learners. “Every year, we are accumulating the number of graduate teachers who are untrained on ICT and they will not be able to control the content our children are accessing through the technology devices they are using in schools,” he said. Kiambu county education director Victoria Mulili said teachers teach the syllabus rather than the learner. She encouraged teachers to get ICT knowledge since the government want ICTs integrated in schools.
