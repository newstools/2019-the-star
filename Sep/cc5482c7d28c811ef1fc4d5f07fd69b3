Forbes unveiled Â its ranking of the biggest hip-hop artistes in the world in 2019 , and for the first time, Kanye West is at the top. Kanye's 150 million estimated income nearly doubles hip-hop's first billionaire, Jay Z, who clocked in at a cool $81 million to claim the second spot. The most streamed artiste, Drake, took the third spot with 75 million dollars. At 42, Kanye, whose new album 'Jesus Is King' is expected end of this year, has won more than 150 million dollars. Gains gathered largely, thanks to the success of his Yeezy! Adidas partnership, expected to result in 1.5 billion in sales in 2019, which is half of the revenue of Nike's Air Jordan. The artiste, who was already the 3rd best paid artist in 2019 according to the Forbes Top 100, and who is often trolled for his public outings, is nonetheless an informed businessman, just like his wife Kim Kardashian.
