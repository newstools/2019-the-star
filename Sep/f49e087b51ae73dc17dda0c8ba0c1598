As the  Kenya Premier League enters matchday four this weekend, Chemelil Sugar coach Francis Baraza has warned their Sunday opponents' AFC Leopards to brace up for tough times as his wounded side plot revenge. Chemelil are bottom of the table after a disastrous start to the league. They lost 3-1 and 4-0 to Zoo Kericho and Sofapaka respectively while their second match against defending champions Gor Mahia was rescheduled to allow K'Ogalo honour their away CAF Champions League match against Algerian side, USM Alger. As the team resumed training yesterday, Baraza wants his new-look side to tighten the defence and sharpen the blunt attack to rediscover their goal-scoring touch. Worrying statistics have seen seven goals conceded in two matches. He said: "What I know is that they (Leopards) conceded four against Sofapaka and are bound to be overconfident. But they will meet a totally different proposition. The boys know they lost terribly and will be playing with renewed vigour." Even though the team remain work in progress, Baraza believes his players have a point to prove against Casa Mbungo's tutored side. He said a five-match winless run against Ingwe is nothing to worry about as they look to bounce back to winning ways. He added: "We are not pushovers and the boys are determined to arrest the poor run. Conceding seven goals in two matches is unacceptable. We are working on our costly defensive blunders. Leopards have a strong team with a good bench but my boys will be a  handful for them. The hunger and desire in the boys is exceptional and they are ready for the challenge. " With tougher tests against Kariobangi Sharks, Bandari and Kakamega Homeboyz to come, Sunday will be ideal for Chemelil to right their wrongs and set records straight with three points.
