The importance of having a good school infrastructure is that students will be in a more conducive environment to achieve the expected rewarding results. Poorly built buildings in government schools expose students to lots of harm including leaking roofs; which means students cannot concentrate in harsh climatic conditions and hence paralysing studies. Hidden corridors in some schools can create havens for bullying and hideouts for truants while deplorable structures demotivate students to even be in the classroom. This situation is even worse in schools located in marginalised areas as students face the possibility of studying under trees or even being attacked by wild animals. Others are exposed to terrorist attacks by Shabaab militants, especially in the Northeastern region. Some schools lack even the essential equipment for proper functioning like science laboratories, libraries and lavatories. Lack of scientific laboratories denies students the opportunity to put into practice the theories they learn in the classroom. Others have to walk long distances to other schools for the practical lessons, which would reduce their productivity by the time they get to the lab.  Students need classrooms that are well-ventilated and well-lit for proper learning to take place. The government should acknowledge and address overcrowding in schools, make funding schools a priority, raise standards of teachers and provide a conducive environment for learning. Schools with deplorable structures should either be closed or upgraded to standards that don’t threaten the safety of students and teachers. Public schools should receive state funding on time to acquire the necessary equipment.  Mombasa
