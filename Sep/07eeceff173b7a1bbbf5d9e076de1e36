A Busia woman who pleaded guilty of failing to cooperate with enumerators during the concluded census exercise will be detained pending a court ruling. Christine Akinyi appeared before Busia principal magistrate Samson Temo charged with failing to give information regarding her family to enumerator Kasion Karani, a person authorised to collect statistical information for the Kenya National Census 2019. The offence is alleged to have been committed at Ododoi village, Olobai sub-location of Akadetewai location, Malaba Township in Teso North subcounty onÂ August 27. Akinyi, however, denied having knowledge of the exercise that was taking place countrywide stating that the enumerators were strangers to her. Magistrate Temo ordered that the accused be remanded in police custody until September 16, when the ruling was to be made. In the same court, a man who pleaded guilty of impersonating Kenya Power employee was fined Sh50,000.
