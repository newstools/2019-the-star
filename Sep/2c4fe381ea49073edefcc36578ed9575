Eight suspects arrested for allegedly defrauding job seekers with promises for opportunities in Kuwait will be held for two days pending investigations. Police had requested that the eight be detained for 14 days at the Central police station as they seek to collect more evidence and collect witness statements. “The complainants amount to 300 people and from various parts of the country, hence necessary time is required to interview, record their statements and obtain documentary evidence,” the affidavit said. Court documents say the suspects obtained a total of Sh20 million from the complainants as employment and travel fees where each paid between Sh120,000 and Sh200,000. The money was to cater for logistics, training and transport to Kuwait. Police also said they needed to obtain CCTV footages from Clarion and 680 hotels in Nairobi. Further, it is alleged that one suspect at large, allegedly from NYS headquarters, had been receiving the money with the promise that the group would be transported there before the exit to JKIA. According to corporal Peter Sawe, the suspects were arrested on September 17 following a distress call from security officers at Clarion Hotel in Nairobi. Appearing before chief magistrate Martha Mutuku, the defence opposed the detention and claimed that the suspects are the people who reported to the police on the matter. The magistrate ruled that there were no compelling reasons to detain the suspects for such a long time. The court thus directed that the suspects be detained for two days and appear in court on Friday. “In the case that they are not charged on Friday, the police should release them on police bond,” Mutuku said.
