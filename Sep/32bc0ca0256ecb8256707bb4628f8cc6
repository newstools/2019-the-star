Music is believed to have the power to soothe one’s mind. Unfortunately, artists nowadays don’t concentrate on the content of their songs but about how much the song will entertain the public, believing this is the only way they will gain fame. Some songs have such ‘dirty’ lyrics that they have been banned. Such songs should only be played in clubs. Musicians should put aside their obsession for instant fame and release decent songs that will pass a helpful message to the public. If the message pleases many people, that’s fame for the artist.
