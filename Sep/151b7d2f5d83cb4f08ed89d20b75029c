Kenya is likely to be represented by just two athletes in the 5,000m race at the World Championships in Doha, Qatar later this month. Athletics Kenya (AK) vice president in charge of competitions, Paul Mutwii, revealed that the Athletes Integrity Unit (AIU) are yet to give them the way forward since the top two athletes at the national trials do not meet the required anti-doping provisions. Under the new rule and with Kenya on the spotlight due to the recent numerous anti-doping violations, AIU requires athletes heading to Doha to have a minimum of three out-of-competition tests which Michael Kibet and Daniel Simiyu, first and second during last week’s trials, do not meet. “If the status quo remains, we shall be forced to send only two athletes in the 5,000m race, Nicholas Kimeli and Jacob Kiprop — who were third and fourth at the trials and who have met the required provisions,” said Mutwii. “The AIU promised to reply to AK’s request for an additional athlete tomorrow. It will be very unfortunate if we are forced to send just two, considering the importance of the race to Kenyans and the kind of competition expected from our opponents,” added Mutwii. Mutwii also revealed that AK will send six athletes for the 4x400m mixed relay. “With four of our athletes taking part in the 400m, we feel it will be safe for us to send an additional two runners. Injuries are part of the game and any of the four can sustain one and we don’t want a situation where we can forfeit this golden chance to race in the sprints,” said Mutwii. Alphas Kishoyian, Alex Sampao, Hellen Syombua and Mary Moraa have qualified for the 400m and will now be joined by Joseph Poghisio and Maureen Thomas in the 4x400m mixed relay team. The team starts departing for Doha early next week, led by the marathoners. Two-time world champion Ednah Kiplagat, Ruth Chepngetich and Visiline Jepkesho will be Kenya’s first finalists in the women’s marathon final on the first day of competition, September 27.
