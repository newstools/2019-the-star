Over 20 teams drawn from across the country are set to battle it out for the fifth edition of the annual Kaimosi Forest handball extravaganza scheduled for September 21-22nd at the Kaimosi Technical Training Institute in Vihiga County. The event, which is being organised by the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) western branch, is among the top-flight events on their calendar and is expected to attract a large number of participants. Event coordinator Akaka Shisoka, who is also the KHF western branch secretary-general, said the prestigious event will be played under two categories. “We shall have a senior category for both men and women featuring clubs and colleges while the junior cadre will comprise high schools (both girls and boys). “Registration is ongoing with senior category teams paying Sh3000 and school teams will part Sh2000. “The coordinating committee has done everything possible that will see the teams being served with a lot of fairness as we have gone a step higher to seek the services of the highly qualified referees,” said Shisoka. Shisoka appealed to the county government of Vihiga to support the event as one way of diversifying the fast-growing sporting industry that is creating both direct and indirect employment to the thousands of youths in the country. Masinde Muliro University who beat Bungoma Youth last year in the final will defend the men's crown with counterparts who also beat University of Eldoret defending female title.
