Two people escaped death narrowly after a lorry they were in plunged into the Indian Ocean at Lamu’s Mokowe Jetty on Saturday evening. The two, a driver and his conductor, jumped out of the window of the lorry. They were in the process of reversing the vehicle shortly after offloading construction materials at the jetty. Neither was hurt in the incident. Only the lorry's rear was inside the waters. Witnesses said they never expected the mishap as the driver was a frequent visitor. Athman Mahazi, a loader at the jetty, said, “We just saw people scrambling out of the window of the lorry while screaming and shouting for help before the lorry landed into the water." Lamu county deputy commissioner Louis Rono confirmed the incident and said police were working with local divers to pull out the vehicle so as not to hinder navigation. He asked motorists using the jetties to cautious during loading and offloading so as to avoid such incidents and casualties. “The driver seems to have missed some angle as he tried to reverse the vehicle and park it and that’s when it veered off and fell into the ocean. We are glad all occupants are safe. Our officers are working on retrieving the lorry,” he said. Jetty accidents are not new to Lamu. In October 2015, three people sustained serious injuries after a Toyota Probox they were in plunged into the ocean at the Mokowe jetty as the driver attempted to reverse and park. They were rescued by local divers. Edited by R.Wamochie
