THE inaugural Basketball Africa League (BAL) qualifiers have now been moved to Madagascar. Zone Five secretary Vitalis Gode could not divulge more information about this surprise turn of events that will deny Kenyans a chance to watch a top show. He said he is waiting for official communication from FIBA. Gode disclosed last week that Mombasa would host the championship after Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) confirmed their preparedness. The dates for the event have also been moved from October 29- November 3 with three teams having confirmed entry. Joining KPA in Group ‘F’ are GNBC from Madagascar and Beau Vallon Heat from Mauritius. Clubs from Seychelles and Comoros are yet to confirm. KPA, who are also the reigning national league champions, have continued to beef up their squad ahead of the event. Coach Sammy Kiki revealed he wants to make a mark in the tournament. The porters are third on the log and will be in Nairobi to play second-placed Thunder in a crunch league tie. After the qualifiers, the next phase of the tournament involving some of the continent’s big-wigs will tip-off on March 2020. A total of 48 teams divided into eight groups (A to F0 have been lined up to start the race in this lucrative show. Cairo (Egypt), Dakar (Senegal), Lagos ( Nigeria), Luanda (Angola), Rabat (Morocco) and either Monastir or Tunis (Tunisia) have been named as host cities.
