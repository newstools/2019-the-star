DJ Mo and Size 8 celebrated their sixth wedding anniversary on Tuesday. Size 8 surprised her hubby with dinner and cake as their daughter Ladasha and close friends cheered them on. Speaking to Word Is, the mother of one says she is beyond grateful to God as she always used to wonder how people stick to marriage for years. "I used to see people married for long and wonder how it is possible to be with one person for all these years with all the ups and downs," she said. She says she always dreamt of having a family while young and to her, this is a dream come true. Sharing a video of the occasion with her fans, Size 8 revealed that DJ Mo had forgotten about the anniversary. “Anyway, it was great he didn't remember coz I took a chance to just appreciate him being my husband for six years by surprising him coz he always surprises me," she wrote. DJ Mo, on the other hand, said his busy schedule made him forget their anniversary. “I had forgotten about our 6th anniversary as you all know wanaume we have a lot na kuhustle," he wrote.
