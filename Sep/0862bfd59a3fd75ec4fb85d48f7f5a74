Kikuyu pop musician Samidoh escaped unhurt after he was involved in an accident on Sunday. Samidoh and other Kikuyu artistes performed at Mugithi Festival on Saturday at Barclay's Sports Club, Thika Road. Mugithi festival is a celebration of Gikuyu tradition, music, food, art and fashion in the form of a concert. The event was also attended by politicians like Moses Kuria. Taking it to social media, the popular musician posted a photo of his car with a dent. "It's hard to understand how somethings happen. Thank you, God, you saved my kids and me," he captioned it. His near-death experience comes weeks after Kikuyu benga star John DeMathew died in an accident. Samidoh was supposed to attend a thanksgiving ceremony of his assistant at his homeland in Nyahururu on Sunday. "Rising from madathi (mandazi) hawking in Nairobi to a reputable engineer is no mean achievement," he previously wrote. "Dear Fans & Supporters, let's all meet in his Graduation thanksgiving ceremony held in Kirimangai Village, Ol Joro Orok, this Sunday from noon." Media personality Jeff Kuria said Samidoh did not have major injuries, although he went to Avenue Greenspan Hospital for check-up. Singer Joyce Wa Mama said she has been trying to reach him but his phone is switched off. When Word Is reached out, Samidoh's phone was off. His fans have wished him well. Favoured Joy James wrote, "I'm pretty sure God is not yet done with u bro....u hv more hundreds n hundreds candles to blow...be strong n keep trusting the high most and all shall be well." Eunice Kagure wrote, "Glory be to Jehovah for his protection. May he continue surrounding you and family with his mercy. Let us all declare that no more road accidents in our motherland. We all need to go on your knees and ask for forgiveness from our maker. Also for his protection from the evil one. IJMN Amen."
