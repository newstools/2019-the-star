A chief and sub area have been detained for 14 days as suspects in Meru over the murder of a middle aged man. Athwana assistant chief John Kobia and Antwanthama sub area manager Joseph Gikuria were on Wednesday arraigned at Kirindine Court before magistrate Paul Weshuri. They are suspected to have beaten up and killed Joseph Mugaa between August 14 and 15, 2019. Investigating officer Stephen Muraga filed an affidavit before court seeking to detain the two accused for 14 days to allow time to complete investigation into the matter. Muraga said if the two are released on bail they would jeopardise ongoing investigations and interfere with possible witnesses. The court said due to seriousness of the matter the two will be detained at Mikinduri Police Station for the two weeks. The matter will appear before court for mention on September 19, 2019.
