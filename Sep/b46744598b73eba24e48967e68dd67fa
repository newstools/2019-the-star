Schools in Manda, Lamu, are yet to re-open for the Third Term as parents keep their children indoors fearing that they might be attacked by lions roaming the island. At least 500 learners from Manda Maweni and Manda Airport primary schools and Manda Airport Secondary School are affected. The three beasts are said to have swum across the Mkanda channel three weeks ago from Boni-Dodori reserve during low tide. They have killed more than 10 goats and donkeys. A handful of parents and teachers on Wednesday held a crisis meeting over the situation. Lamu county director of Education Joshua Kanga on Wednesday said stakeholders had met with the security officers and arrangements would be made to ensure safety to and from schools. He assured parents that their children will be protected. “Yes, learning has been hampered. Students didn’t turn up for fear of being attacked. We want to assure parents that plans have been made to ensure the safety of their children and schools and they should release them,” Kanga said. But parents are adamant they will not release their children before they are confident of their young ones' security. Nyumba Kumi official Joseph Syounda said they need proof that the lions are gone. “They know very well that the lions are still here. We hear them roaring daily,” he said. Lamu county KWS senior warden Mathias Mwavita said rangers were on Monday dispatched to track the lions and capture and return them to their Boni-Dodori reserve. Mwavita said, “We are doing all we can to catch the lions. We call for calm and patience. We are ready to provide security for learners so that they attend school.”
