Singer Akothee on Monday made a grand entry in Homa Bay town and temporally stopped activities at a supermarket. She was on a mission to promote food products from Premier Food Industries and Silverstone airline. Residents were surprised to see heavily built men walking around a Prado vehicle branded Madam Boss. Some, including women, ran towards the vehicle to have a glance at it. Patrick Kaunga, who was among security men, said they were overwhelmed with the crowd. “The crowd thronged the bank where Akothee went to withdraw some money. We were not checked in due to pressure from the people who wanted to see her,” Kaunga said. Even boda boda operators abandoned their motorbikes beside the road to come and see Akothee. Supermarket management had to order security guards to close the main doors to control the crowd that had gathered around. “She went straight to the counter with her security guards, paid and distributed to other customers near her,” Otieno said. The airline will promote business and tourism in the Southern Nyanza region. During the launch, Akothee also talked to Kochia Luo traditional dancers. “The flight would make it easy for us to come, meet and develop talented artistes from this area,” she said.
