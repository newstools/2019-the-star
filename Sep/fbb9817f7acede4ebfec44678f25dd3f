Newcomers Rising Starlets unbeaten run face a serious test when they line up against champions Nairobi Queens and National Cereals and Produce and Produce Board as the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) National League enters third round at the Kaloleni grounds. Starlets have so far prevailed over National Youth Services and Mt Kenya University-Thika. The newbies battle NCPB today before crossing swords with back-to-back league winners Queens tomorrow. In the men's league, Rangers who last season defied odds to finish fifth, launch their title campaign against Generation before they tackle NYS tomorrow. The western-based outfit who have endured financial constraints have set their sight on going a step further this season. Team's coach Gerald Juma said their financial status haven't changed but the team is keen to do well. “Ours has been a struggle to honour matches with players contributing among themselves and few well-wishers coming on board. If only we could get a sponsor, maybe performance would be different but all in all, we hope for an improved performance going forward,” observed Juma. Other matches on the card today will see  NCPB play Inspired Boys, Technical University of Kenya square it out with Warriors, former champions Black Mamba welcome MKU-Thika before Strathmore University wrap up the day with a tie against Jomo Kenyatta University Agricultural Technology. Tomorrow, MKU-Thika cross swords with Inspired boys before Buccaneers take on Warriors.
