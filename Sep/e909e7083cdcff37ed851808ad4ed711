MPs have rejected one of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s nominees to the National Land Commission on account of presenting a fake tax clearance certificate. The National Assembly’s Lands Committee chaired by Kitui South MP Rachael Nyamai has not approved former Isiolo Woman Representatives Tayi Galgalo, whose tax compliance certificate has been disowned by the Kenya Revenue Authority. The Committee, which spent the weekend in Mombasa compiling the report, has recommended barring the former lawmaker, saying the way she obtained the crucial tax clearance document is suspect. The committee, however, approved nomination of the remaining eight nominees to the commission. While appearing before the Lands Committee last week on Friday, KRA Commissioner General James Mburu told the MPs that Galgalo is tax noncompliant, revealing she has not filed returns for 2017 and 2018. Galgalo had submitted the same tax compliance certificate to the NLC selection panel and the vetting committee. Mburu said the authority had launched internal investigations to unearth how the fake certificate was issued and said he would report to the committee. “We are investigating internally our staff to establish who helped her in obtaining the fake compliance certificate; it cannot be valid until we verify the details,” Mburu told the committee. Last week, Galgalo denied engaging in any fraud in obtaining the document, saying the certificate was sent to her mail after applying through the e-portal. The committee met on Wednesday to adopt the report before tabling it on Thursday.
