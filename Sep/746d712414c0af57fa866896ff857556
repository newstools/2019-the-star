Gospel singer Weezdom is back to Bahati's record label EMB. Previously, he left theÂ Mama hitmaker's label over claims his music was not being released as frequently as he wanted. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, Weezdom gave the reasons why he has made his return. "It is a very personal decision. He was the one who put me in the limelight since the first day. I have been attacking him since I left his label but I thought it wasn't the right thing to do. "I reached out to him because my pastor and friends have been telling me to apologise for a long time. My mother takes Bahati as his own child, he has helped her so much, even when we weren't in good terms with him. "He has the anointing which is connected to me. It is very rare to find a man asking another man for forgiveness, but I did that because I wanted to go back home." Weezdom had been signed under DJ Sadic's label Genius Entertainment. "Sadic and I had a different kind of contract, which was based on projects. I wasn't enclosed there for years, it was a way of me not being stuck. We didn't break up, it was just a different agreement," he said. "I haven't gone to EMB as a business, I'm just back home. Bahati is more than a person signing me, he is my father in the music industry." Weezdom and Bahati have released a new song called 'Block', which he (Weezdom) says is a new chapter for him. "We are blocking all kinds of negativity, the devil and temptations. It's like putting a reminder in your mind to ignore the wrong things and embrace what is good," he said. "I have started a new journey and I don't want to confuse my fans. I want to preach the gospel and I forgive everyone."
