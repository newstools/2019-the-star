Nominated MP David Ole Sankok has said he regrets his decision to join politics, adding he will not contest or accept any nomination in 2022. In an interview with K24 on Wednesday , he disclosed that being an MP has taken a toll on him financially since he was nominated into the National Assembly in 2017. "I was economically very comfortable before I became an MP and I have ever regretted becoming an MP. Trust me I will not go for a second term. The fastest way to become poor in Kenya is to become a politician," he said. Known for his bright colored signature suits, with stripes of the national flag,the MP disclosed the frustrations as a legislator. "There are several political brokers whose work is to wake up every morning and look for MPs wherever they are and especially someone like me who is branded, who can be seen from far and asked for money," he said. He said social media makes things worse, with politicians "who do not give money or favours being criticised and insulted". “Politics in Kenya is very hard. It is a very dirty game where everyone thinks you are their property. Personally, I’m not used to giving out free things. As a disabled person, I have struggled. I  can’t just give out money freely,”he said. Sankok has his eyes set on  the United Nations as a special adviser for persons with disabilities. "I will probably go to the United Nations as a special adviser for issues to do with disability. I will contribute more there. I feel I have done enough,” he said. The IEBC on August 25,2017 listed Sankok as Jubilee nominated MP for persons with disabilities. Before his nomination, he formally retired from the National Council for Persons with Disabilities after serving for three years as the chairman. Sankok said he decided to voluntarily retire, and had notified President Uhuru Kenyatta that he does not wish for his term to be extended because he wants to “engage in other businesses”.
