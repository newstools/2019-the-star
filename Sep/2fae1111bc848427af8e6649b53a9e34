A man had been sentenced to serve 15 years imprisonment for defiling and impregnating a pupil in Kawangware. Isaiah Abudiko defiled the 16-year-old between 2017 and 2018. Anne (not her real name) said she knew the accused, who was their neighbor, well and even referred to him as uncle. She had just gotten home from school and was basking in the sun when she saw Abudiko outside his house. “I got up went to greet him but instead he grabbed my hand and pulled me inside his house,” she told the court. Anne did not understand Abudiko’s intentions until he stuffed her mouth with clothes and asked her to lie down. “He took cushions from the seat and arranged them on the floor and ordered me to lay on them facing up,” she narrated, “He then undressed me and proceeded to defile me”. Anne said she could not scream with the clothes in her mouth, so she lay down in pain. When the accused was done, Anne said he sternly warned her not to report to anyone what had happened. “He said he would kill me if I told anyone,” Anne said. The minor reported that Abudiko continued to defile her whenever he got a chance and she suffered in silence until one day she became pregnant. Kibera Senior Principal Magistrate Boaz Ombewa said: "I have considered both the defence and prosecution evidence and find the accused person. I accordingly sentence you to serve 15 years in prison for the offence."
