A Kilifi bishop has urged Christians to reject the Building the Bridges Initiative and the Punguza Mzigo bills because they do not serve the interests of wananchi. Thomas Kakala of Jesus Cares Centre Ministries said both bills were ideas of few individuals and are meant to serve the political class. Addressing a press conference at his church on Tuesday, Kakala said the church was not consulted by the BBI team. “Old and tired people led the BBI process. They are on the exit process and shall leave problems to Kenyans,” the bishop said. Kakala said senators, woman representatives, MPs who were elected to speak on behalf of wananchi becuase the country is for everyone. He said the current Constitution does not suit the interests of the politicians that's why they want to change it. “If BBI and Punguza Mizigo Bill will not address the issues affecting wananchi, reject them. They're fake,” he told the faithful. During the constitution-making process, he said, the church opposed the creation of 47 counties because they predicted difficulties in financing. But some political bigwigs pushed for their approval. Kakala called on the leadership of the country not to take Kenyans for granted and warned that the bills will be rejected. Kilifi MCAs are currently conducting public participation forums to get views from wananchi before the Bill is debated. (edited by O. Owino)
