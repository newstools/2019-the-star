The Kenya Wildlife Service has finally succeeded in driving out three lions that have tormented Manda villagers in Lamu for the past three weeks. The marauding lions had literally brought activities, including learning and economic engagements, to a halt as residents stayed indoors for fear of attacks. At least 500 students from Manda Maweni Primary, Manda Airport Primary and Manda Airport Secondary schools had remained holed up in their homes as parents swore not to release them until the lions were caught. The wild animals had killed 10 goats and donkeys. They were believed to have invaded the village in search of food. They crossed the Indian Ocean during low tides. KWS officers had camped in the village to hunt them down. Their efforts paid off after they drove them back to the Boni Dodori game reserve across the ocean. By Thursday morning, learning had resumed in all schools. Parents were seen accompanying their children to school. Lamu KWS Senior warden Mathias Mwavita confirmed that the lions were no longer in Manda. "People can now resume their activities without fear. We've also dispatched our officers to the schools to assure learners and teachers that there is no cause for concern," he said. Lamu county education director Joshua Kanga urged parents who had yet to release their children to do so. "The three schools are already in session. The KWS has confirmed to us the lions are no longer in Manda and so people can live peacefully again," he said. Village head Bernad Nyachae said stone quarrying, the economic mainstay of villagers, had also resumed. The miners had initially been asked to stay away from the quarries for fear that the lions could be hiding there. "Things are okay. Quarrying has also resumed. We want to applaud the KWS for a good job," Nyachae said. (Edited by F'Orieny)
