Four camel herders have sued the state seeking to stop their displacement from Kitui-Tana River border following a dispute over grazing land. Mohamud Mohammed, Ahmed Elmi, Isman Kulo and Mohammed Shuriye have complained about a police directive to remove their camels from the Kitui side of the border. Suit papers say police descended on their village on September 20 and ordered them to move camels to Bangale which is in the Tana River side. The directive does not affect cattle and goats. The four claim that Bangale area has no water and grass and moving camels there will risk their lives. “The applicants face an imminent danger of losing their livelihoods from not being able to graze their camels which is the main source of livelihood,” the court heard. In their suit papers, the four say that the communities around that specific border all graze their livestock from one location to another indiscriminately. It has been the main socio-economic activity of that area for ages, they argue. The four now claim that as a result of the directive by police the entire community feels insecure. They argue that they were never allowed to contribute to the decision that has led to evictions and are now confused as to where to take their camels. “The applicants do not want a similar scenario where over 200 camels were shot and killed in 2017 causing a lot of tension among the otherwise peaceful communities,” the suit papers read in part. They want the court to issue an order blocking their displacement.
