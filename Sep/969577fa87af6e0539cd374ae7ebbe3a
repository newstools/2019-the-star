Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha has dumped his agent for failing to secure him a move away from Selhurst Park, according to reports. Zaha had admitted before last season came to an end that he wanted a new challenge and to compete in Europe, with both Arsenal and Everton showing heavy interest in the Ivory Coast international. However, Zaha had to stay put in the summer as Palace played hardball over their £80m valuation of their star man. But according to the Times, Zaha has told his agent he wants to terminate their contract, citing the latter’s relationship with Palace chairman Steve Parish. It has been reported that the agent, Will Salthouse, whose agency USM helped thrash out some of the biggest deals of the summer window, has been told in writing about Zaha’s desire to go their different ways. The FA have now been informed of a ‘dispute’ between the 26-year-old and his agent, according to sources. Contracts between players and representatives are lodged with England’s governing body. Meanwhile, Zaha will be hoping to let his football do the talking once more when the Premier League returns this weekend. Palace, who sit fourth in the Premier League with seven points from their first four matches, take on Tottenham away on Saturday afternoon.
