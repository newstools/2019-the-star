The Embu government has launched a digital public participation platform to reach out and get the views of residents. The online platform can be accessed on mobile phones. The platform will compliment the normal public participation process. The platform called Embu Open Governance Interactive Platform was formed in conjunction with an NGO –Fahamu Network for Social Justice. Speaking while launching the platform on Sunday, Elisa Meriabe of Fahamu, said residents will be able to follow up on the projects being run by the county government and the budget allocated to them. Meriabe said residents will give their views from the initial stage of the budget-making process to the final audit of the completed projects and whether they are of any use to society. “The digital platform gives residents room for interaction with the county government, where they can contribute their views on the budget-making process and on various projects being run by the government,” she said. Embu Administration chief officer Muturi Ireri said the digital platform will give public participation a meaning to people of all walks of life. It will also help Embu residents to document and question what the county is doing. "I can assure you that the county government will be ready to give timely responses," Ireri said. He said public participation is always attended by a few selected individuals who sometimes find it hard to understand what is going on due to limited access to information.
