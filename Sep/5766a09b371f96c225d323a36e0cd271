Legislators in Embu on Saturday promised to rally residents behind Deputy President William Ruto in 2022. They include Mbeere North MP Muriuki Njagagua, Runyenjes’s Erick Muchangi, Manyatta’s John Muchiri, Mbeere  South’s Godfrey King'ang'i, Senator Njeru Ndwiga, Cecily Mbarire (nominated) and former Senator Lenny Kivuti. Muchangi said he will support the DP owing to his development record and accessibility. “Are you feeling intimidated? Are you going to support him even when he is abused and criticised without good reason? What about when they say he is not good? What about when lies are fabricated about him? What do you tell them? You should tell them he is indomitable” Muchangi said. Muchiri said residents should support Ruto because he is young and reaches out to all the regions without discrimination. King'ang'i said Mbeere South people will elect a person who minds about their welfare. The legislators spoke in Kabaci village, Mbeere North, when Ruto launched a two-day extensive tour of development projects. He launched the Siakago Technical Training College, expected to cost over Sh100 milion, and the tarmacking of Kiritiri Siakago road. The DP also launched Runyenjes Technical Training College, and met with cooperative societies leaders. Ruto said the government is committed to complete four stalled mega dams in Embu county. They are Thambana, Rupingaci, Kamumu and Thuci. Embu Deputy Governor David Kariuki and assembly speaker Josiah Thiriku also attended the function.
