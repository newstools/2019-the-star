Patrick Nderitu Gitonga and Allan Oyende are among the top players expected to feature in the annual Masters scrabble tournament this weekend at  Journey Rest Hotel in Kirinyaga. After winning back-to-back titles in Busia and Nairobi, Nicholas Mbugua is also expected to join the fray in the penultimate stage of the national Scrabble Kenya series ahead of the World English Scrabble Players Association Championships (WESPAC) in Goa from October 15-20 15th to 22nd in Goa, India. Gitonga and Oyende will anchor the Kenya team also known as Word Warriors to India following their superlative performance in the national tournaments. With only the Nairobi leg of the national series remaining before India show,  the top players will be using the event as part of their preparations for the world event. Scrabble Kenya chairman Bernard Amuke said the weekend event will be the start of a long journey to the India show. “The team is well prepared for the Masters' show and we intend to take the event a notch higher," he noted.
