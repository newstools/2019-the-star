Detectives have so far questioned eight people in relation to the murder of a 74-year-old woman and her daughter in Nairobi. No suspect has been arrested in connection to the two murders. Nairobi regional police commander Philip Ndolo said those quizzed are among ten people who were on the DCI's radar over the double murder. Ndolo said two more people are yet to be questioned. Those who have recorded statements include estate guards, neighbours and the deceased women’s close relatives. “So far, eight out of ten people have recorded statements with the DCI. The detectives are still gathering evidence in relation to the murders,” Ndolo said. The police boss said some of the deceased women’s relatives had not recorded statements. “They were expected to do so by the end of business today,” Ndolo added. He spoke to the Star on the phone on Friday. The bodies of Judith Mwai and her 47-year-old daughter Catherine were recovered from their house at Golden Gate Estate in South B on Monday. It is suspected the two were murdered on Sunday, shortly after they were reportedly dropped at the residence by a black Toyota Prado. Ndolo said police are still combing through mobile phones data and analysing CCTV footage from the estate. Judith was a retired employee at the Treasury while her daughter reportedly resigned from the Cooperative Bank. She was living in the house where they were slain with her husband John Mwai and the daughter. Police said John was not in the house on the night when the two were murdered. According to detectives, he had been admitted to a city hospital during the incident. He has been ailing for the last ten years. Judith and her daughter will be buried at her matrimonial home in Kimuri village in Kerugoya, Kirinyaga county, on October 1.
