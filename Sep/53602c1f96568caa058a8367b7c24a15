Dutch Tycoon Tob Cohen's burial has been pushed to tomorrow. Reports indicate that the ceremony lacked a quorum of priests who are to perform the burial rites. At least 10 priests and a rabbi are required. However, Cohen's widow Sarah Wairimu and the tycoon's brother Bernard only managed to raise eight priests. The burial has now been pushed to Tuesday at 2.30 pm. High Court Judge Stella Mutuku had ordered that Sarah be escorted to the Jewish Cemetery to attend the burial of the late husband today at 2 pm. The burial will be held in accordance with the Jewish burial rites and will be private. Sarah last week filed for an application seeking the court to issue a production order and also be escorted to the Jewish Cemetery. Sarah is accused of murdering her husband and is due for psychiatric assessment before she pleads to the charge on September 26.
