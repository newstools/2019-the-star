The Maasai Mara University has received water analysis equipment and facilities worth Sh105 million from the Chinese government. The equipment will aid in research to address water challenges facing drylands and wetlands in Kenya. University vice chancellor Mary Walingo thanked the Chinese government and Chinese Academy for the donation and also for refurbishing the university’s laboratories. Walingo spoke on Saturday while receiving the equipment. “I would first and foremost like to thank the Chinese Academy of Sciences for their continued support and collaboration with our campus. The equipment will go a long way in helping intensify research,” she said. Maasai Mara University has endured a lack of equipment, forcing the institution to take some of their students to the University of Nairobi  for training. “When we take our students to Nairobi University, we are usually forced to pay for laboratory services and now we are reversing this order. Soon others will come to us and pay for these services,” she added. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has also helped Maasai Mara University set up a botanical garden and a water treatment facility.
