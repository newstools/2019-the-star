Jubilee candidate for the upcoming Kibra by-election, MacDonald Mariga, has finally been handed a nomination certificate by the IEBC. Mariga on Monday received the certificate from IEBC returning officer in Kibra Beatrice Muli, who had disqualified him from the race last week. Mariga will now face off with ODM's Imran Okoth, Ford Kenya's Khamisi Butichi, Mudavadi's ANC Eliud Owallo and Editer Achieng of Ukweli Party in the race slated for November 7. IEBC has cleared 23 candidates, 14 of whom are vying on political party tickets while the remaining are independent candidates. Mariga had been thrown in a dilemma after Muli invalidated his candidature on grounds that he was not a registered voter. But on Monday, after Mariga filed an appeal, IEBC's Dispute Resolution Committee cleared Mariga for the by-election. Chairperson Wafula Chebukati, while confirming the validation of Mariga, said his name would be included on the list. Mariga said winning the petition had relieved him and renewed  hishopes of winning the seat. He said he had forgiven his rivals, whom he alleged wanted him out of the race. Mariga’s legal team led by lawyer Elisha Ongoyi had pushed Muli to admit an error and pleaded with the committee to rectify the mistake by overturning the decision. The seat fell vacant after former MP Ken Okoth died of cancer on July 26 at the Nairobi Hospital.
