Having fled from war, Kakuma refugee camp rapper King Moses uses music to preach love. "I sing about things that happen every day, like right now about xenophobia," he told Word Is on Friday. "I'm currently working on my song 'Cherie', one that I shot in Mombasa, which is a dedication to all women." He made headlines with the song 'Ma Champagne' featuring Lisa, which was supported by rapper Octopizzo. He also released a song about HIV-Aids. "We have forgotten ourselves for not using condoms to protect us," he said. "It is an awareness song and also one that will encourage those who have the virus. It is not the end of their lives." King Moses also told Word Is on Friday about his life in Kakuma and why he fled DRC. "I am originally from the Congo. I ran from war. My dad is a pastor and I can say it was because of him that this happened. He didn't care if you were Congolese or Rwandese because he would help each and everyone without segregating them," he said. "Then people started saying that he was keeping enemies in the house. His mission was only to help and pray for everyone. That's how the fight started. "They wanted to burn him inside the house. He ran to Kenya, followed by my mother and we later united here in Kenya. He was taken by UNHCR, given medication and he is now okay. Life is Kakuma is very hard. But on the other hand, it is good because this country came to our rescue and we are now fine."
