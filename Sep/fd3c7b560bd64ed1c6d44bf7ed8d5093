Two petitioners want the High Court to block the presentation of lawyers named as senior counsel to President Uhuru Kenyatta, citing gender bias and conflict of interest. Hillary Mokaya and Nick Kyunuve are challenging the process of settling on the 24 who are to be conferred the title of senior counsel. They said, first, the selection committee did not explain why it rejected applications from more than 90 lawyers. Second, the two say the composition of the selection committee was unlawful, citing lack of a representative of the Law Society of Kenya by the time the team called for applications. LSK elected their representative last year on March 24. The selection committee comprises of judges Mohammed Ibrahim, Martha Koome, Jacqueline Kamau and Attorney General Kihara Kariuki, lawyers Patricia Mbote, Lucy Kambuni, Omesh Kapila, Nicholas Bichangâ€™a and Lillian Renee Omondi. Third, justices Ibrahim and Koome failed to disclose that some of the applicants were lawyers who represented them before the Judges and Magistrates Board, they said. They further said that justices Ibrahim, Koome and Kamau were appointed to sit in the committee way after the team commenced its work. The committee had sent out a notice calling for applications from lawyers who were interested in the conferment of the title of senior counsel on January 9 and 10, 2018. A total of 90 members of LSK submitted their applications for consideration. On August 26, the committee declared 24 applicants successful. The 24 include former VP Kalonzo Musyoka, Narc Kenya party leader Martha Karua, deputy DPP Dorcas Oduor, former DPP Philip Murgor, Kioko Kilukumi, Judy Thongori, John Chigiti and John Oaga. Under the law, the names of the 24 will be forwarded to Chief Justice David Maraga for onward transmission to President Kenyatta for gazettement. Edited by R.Wamochie
