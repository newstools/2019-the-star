Top two Muthaiga juniors Mutahi Kibugu and Zubair Khan are among the national team players for the forthcoming All Africa Golf Team Championship planned for October 8 – 13 in Mauritius. Khan is currently playing off handicap 2 while his club-mate Mutahi is playing off scratch. The junior will team up with the reigning Kenya Amateur Golf Champion Samuel Njoroge (Handicap +2) of Railway and handicap 1 Simon Njogu of Great Rift Valley Lodge. Njoroge is by and large the most successful Kenyan in the team having already won the 57th Lagos Amateur Open late last year and a host of local KAGC events including Railway Invitational Championship. The Kenyan juniors now have a chance to showcase their talent at continental level after a number of veterans including Nyali’s Mathew Wahome and Vet Lab duo Edwin Mudanyi and Mike Kisia turned professional. The team will be accompanied by Kenya Golf Union (KGU) chairman Anthony Murage. The chairman exuded confidence with the team selected. “It is important to note that this is the same team that participated in Region IV Golf Tournament which was held in Burundi this year and their performance was incredible,” added Murage. During the Region VI, Uganda beat Kenya by 2.5-0.5 points to retain the Africa Region IV tourney at the par-71 Bujumbura Golf Club course earlier in the year. Kenya consequently finished second, Tanzania third, Burundi who fielded two teams finished fourth while their second side finished 6th. After failing to tame perennial rivals Uganda, Kenyans will be at it again against the rest of the continent in an event that had over the years remained a preserve of South Africa.
