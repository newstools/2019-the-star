The standoff over the paternity of a minor in the late Kibra MP Ken Okoth’s life is far from over after his wife, Monica, disputed the DNA results that confirmed he was the father. Two weeks ago, the boy's mother, Anne Thumbi, had produced in court DNA results stating that Okoth was his dad. The results, from an independent pathologist, were produced by her lawyers. However, Monica said – through a lawyer – that her DNA tests differed from Thumbi's. Senior principal magistrate Margaret Obura directed her to produce her results within 14 days. The parties will appear in court on October 2 for further directions. Three DNA tests results filed in court confirmed that Thumbi's son was sired by Okoth. KEMRI confirmed that the chances of Okoth being the father of Thumbi's son were 99.99 per cent. Thumbi moved to court to have Okoth's family recognise her son as his and involve him in burial arrangements. Last month, the nominated MCA told the Star that she was ready to take a DNA test to prove that her five-year-old son was sired by the late MP. She had, through lawyer Elkana Mogaka, sued Okoth's mother Angeline Okoth and Monica together with Lee Funeral Home. The MCA wanted her son to be recognised as Okoth's son before the burial. Mother and son were not allowed to appear in court. Thumbi had said that she and Okoth had been in a relationship for a while and her son was a product of that relationship.
