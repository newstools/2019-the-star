A Senate oversight committee has summoned Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua after he failed to appear for questioning over the 2017-18 audit queries raised by the Auditor General's office. The Senate County Public Accounts and Investment Committee had invited the county chief to appear before it on Wednesday in Kitui where the Senate is sitting. The governor skipped the meeting and instead sent a letter saying the Senator Boniface Kabaka had mobilised goons to attack him in Kitui. "We have intelligence information that youth are being mobilised by my opponents in the region to be ferried to Kitui to heckle me and paint me as corrupt," Mutua said in the letter. Kabaka, however, rubbished the governor's claims, saying the county chief was seeking a cheap excuse to evade questioning. The committee members accused the governor of disrespecting the Senate, terming his excuse as 'juvenile'. "We cannot entertain such juvenile characteristics. The letter does not show that the governor is engaged. It shows that he fears to accountable to the people of Machakos," Narok Senator Ledama Olekina said. Mutua has now been summoned to appear before the panel on September 30, 2019, in Machakos.
