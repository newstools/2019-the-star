Police officers have arrested 54 people in connection with a fresh boundary dispute at Nkararo area of Transmara West subcounty of Narok county on Monday. According to the sub county Deputy County Commissioner Mohammed Hassan Noor, the suspects from Uasin Gishu, Syria and Kisii communities were arrested based on various charges and are currently being held at Kilgoris Police station. “We conducted a joint security officers’ operation that included regular police officers and GSU officers. We were targeting people who were bringing unnecessary tension, breach of peace, incitement, carrying illegal weapons at the border,” Noor told the Star on phone. He said they have launched investigations and each of the suspects will be charged based on incitement and funding clashes between the two communities. Noor also revealed that they are looking for an unnamed politician who is on the run and believed to be the main actor behind the violence. “We have launched a manhunt for the politician who is carrying an illegal firearm. I am warning other politicians who are fueling animosity in the conflict area that the state is keen and they will be arrested and charged before a court of law,” he noted. The administrator added that they will continue with the security operations until calm and peace is restored in the troubled area. He warned youths against being used by criminal elements into fighting one another urging on communities to remain peaceful. “The young people, who are ambitious, should be careful not to be used by politicians pursuing their own interests. They risk not to be employed when their fingerprints are taken to DCI for further investigations and certificate of conduct is required when seeking for any kind of job,” Noor said. He said the government will on Wednesday determine the boundary of the troubled Nkararo that separate Syria and Uasin clans of the Maasai community.
