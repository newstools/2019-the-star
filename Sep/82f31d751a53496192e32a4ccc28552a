Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has thrown his weight behind Ford Kenya's candidate in the Kibra by-election. This follows a meeting with the party leader Moses Wetangula on Friday to hatch up a plan that will see them win the Kibra race. This means that the NASA Coalition duo will be going against their other partner Raila Odinga who has Benard 'Imran' Okoth as the ODM candidate. Wetangula paid Kalonzo a courtesy call at the Wiper headquarters where they discussed plans on how to marshal support for Khamisi Butichi ahead of the by-election set for November 7. They have set a plan that will see Butichi officially unveiled to the residents of Kibra this weekend as campaigns gear up. " Our candidate is the strongest and from the all gathered information I can assure my brother Kalonzo that this Kibra seat is no more a dream but we will carry the day,"Â  Wetangula said. Kalonzo said by his endorsement to Ford-Kenya, it is a give-back situation to the support Wetangula gave them during the Embakasi South by-election. He said Wetangula's vigorous support saw a Wiper candidate floor other competitors, especially in an ODM zone. "Ford Kenya and its leadership stood by our candidate in the Embakasi South by-election and we can't take it for granted. My brotherhood with senator Wetangula too started in the 1980s when I joined politics," Kalonzo said. The meeting was also attended by MPs Richard Onyoka and Ferdinand Wanyoyi. Wiper party had said it will not front its candidate on November 7 Kibra by-elections but will instead have its candidate in Kibra during the 2022 general elections. Butichi ditched Musalia Mudavadi's party ANC which he used during the 2017 elections in Ikolomani. He came second and challenged the outcome in court which was overruled. IEBC has cleared 24 aspirants for the by-election including Imran Okoth of ODM, Eliud Owalo of ANC, McDonald Mariga of Jubilee party among others.
