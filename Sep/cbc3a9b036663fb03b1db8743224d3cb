Nigeria's government has issued a travel advisory against travelling to volatile areas in South Africa following a spate of xenophobic attacks. In a statement on Wednesday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs advised its citizens to avoid travelling to the volatile areas until the situation is brought under control. On Tuesday, Nigeria summoned South Africa's high commissioner over the looting in Johannesburg. It alleged that Nigerian-owned businesses had been targeted in the South African city, saying, in a tweet, that "enough is enough". South African officials have blamed criminality rather than xenophobia for the current problems. On Monday, dozens of people were arrested in Johannesburg after rioters looted shops and torched buildings and vehicles. Police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades in an attempt to quell the unrest.
