Nasa CEO Norman Magaya has been flown to India for specialised medical treatment. A statement by ODM communication director Philip Etale on Sunday said Magaya will be out of the country for 12 to 15 days and that he will be under the care of a panel of expert doctors. Magaya will, however, remain reachable on WhatsApp, the statement said. Etale said his party remains committed to supporting Magaya in his medical journey and wished for his quick recovery. “The Orange party continues to stand with our luminary through this process until his return,” the statement concludes. Magaya has been battling a recurrent heart attack at the Nairobi Hospital. This development follows a fracas that emerged in the family of Magaya a few weeks ago pitting the brothers and mother of Magaya on one hand against her wife Alice Katunge, with the former accusing Katunge of blocking them from accessing her kin at Nairobi Hospital. Reuben Amugira, the elder brother of Magaya had complained that Katunge kept them in the dark over Magaya’s health and only succeeded to visit him at the sickbed after the intervention of ODM leader Raila Odinga.
