Sections of Mombasa roads turned into mini lakes yesterday morning as heavy rains pounded the coastal town. School-going children, travellers and workers were stranded at bus stops. Motorists had it rough. Floodwaters rose up to the car doors and many vehicles stalled. Residents were surprised that the short rains (October-November-December) had come early. Footpaths were impassable. Those who had not left their houses dared not venture outside. The most affected roads were Bondeni and Bamburi, Nyerere and Moi avenues and their feeder roads. A Star of The Sea Primary schoolgirl burst into tears after she fell in a huge pool of water along Nyerere Avenue. The entire school compound was flooded. A matatu got stuck in a manhole along Jomo Kenyatta Avenue. Manholes are uncovered and there are fears that people might drown in them. Many of the manholes are filled with solid waste and no longer drain water. Flooding is an annual happening in Mombasa. Early this year, the chief officer at the county's Department of Transport, Infrastructure and Public Works Albert Keno blamed flooding on the geology of the town. Meanwhile, county meteorological director Edward Ngure yesterday warned that heavy rains accompanied by strong winds might persist. "Fishermen, beach-goers and all in the marine industry should be on high alert,‚Äù he said.
