The second phase of the Kenya Informal settlements Improvement project (KISIP) will begin by the end of this year. The project will benefit selected informal settlements across the country. The first phase that targeted 15 counties has been completed. Housing and Urban Development PS Charles Hinga on Monday said the Cabinet has approved the second phase. He said they are waiting for the go-ahead from the World Bank. Hinga said they would soon sign financial agreements with the World Bank so that the projects could start. “The World Bank is the financier of the project just like the first one, and we have held several meetings to start implementing them in earnest,” he said. Addressing the press in Naivasha, Hinga said the number of counties to benefit would be made clear once the final framework for implementation was out. He said Kenya had a total of 490 informal settlements. “Naivasha was one of towns where the projects were done covering four slums including Kihoto, Karagita, Kamere and Kasarani and these have had great impacts on the lives of residents,” On affordable housing, the PS said they were on course to deliver the promise as outlined in the  Big Four agenda. He said although there were challenges in the housing levy they had found alternative methods to finance the project adding that Kenyans were receptive of the new projects being carried out. “Today, a total of 250,000 Kenyans have registered on the Boma Yangu platform and a further 20,000 have started paying instalments to finally own a house.”
