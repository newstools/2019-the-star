Claims by former Jubilee vice chairman David Murathe that it is only opposition leader Raila Odinga who can beat Deputy President William Ruto in 2022 is a clear indication that the next election will be a contest between dynasties and hustlers. The truth is that the dynasties fear the leadership of the DP because he has been keen on empowering hustlers at the expense of dynasties who want to be richer, widening the gap between them. This is why Murathe and the Kieleweke group that is fighting Ruto are so bitter that some people whose parents are not known are now gaining wealth. It was only recently that Raila said radical changes to the Constitution through the Building Bridges Initiative are on the offing and which will change the countryâ€™s political landscape. These changes are only meant to benefit a few politicians. The former premier is pushing for a change of the Constitution to create the position of Prime Minister among others. But it should be clear that Kenyans want changes that are beneficial to them. Going by the mood of the country, this is not the right time for leaders to call for a change of the system of government. Change of governance system is not a pressing issue for Kenyans but efforts to tame insecurity, improve the economy and eradicate food shortage are some of the issues Kenyans want addressed. Murathe and his group should understand that Kenya is for all people irrespective of their status in society. In as much as he has a constitutional right to campaign for any candidate, he does not have any to tell Kenyans that Ruto or any other person will not be president. If 2022 does become a battle of dynasties and hustlers, let it be a fair field with fair competition.  Kericho
