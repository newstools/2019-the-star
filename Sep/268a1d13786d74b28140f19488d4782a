Ugandan star Irene Ntale is the first-ever artiste from her country to sign a deal with Universal Music Group, Nigeria. In an interview with Word Is on Friday, the 'Gyobera' hitmaker explained how the deal came about. "They told me they wanted to work with me. We had a meeting and earlier this year, we went to Nigeria and listened to their vision," she said. "It aligned with what I wanted for my career. I was so excited and humbled because it meant the door is opened, they can sign anyone from East  Africa. It was a big win for me and for all of us." Ntale is currently making headlines with the song 'Nyamba', which means 'Help Me' in her local dialect Luganda. "It is a love ballad of a woman telling her lover to reciprocate the love, not to search for love elsewhere. It has nice melodies," she said. "Also, expect my very first EP before the year ends, it's already mixed and mastered. A lot of work went into making it. I want to blow people away." What about linking up with Kenyan artistes? "I have spoken to a few people who want to be in studio with me, there are so many amazing Kenyan artistes," she said. "We are growing very fast because there are many talents coming up, with amazing work and serious about their talent. The industry has really grown. We can only expect the best." Ntale is an ambassador with Smart Girls Foundation in Uganda, which provides smart bags with sanitary towels to rural schools. She remembered her interactions with fallen Uganda star Mowzey Radio. The two had done a collabo together. "My collabo 'Bikoola' was written by the late Mowzey Radio.  The news of his death was really sad. Having worked closely with him, I knew how talented he was. We really lost a great talent," she said. "I remember him for his resilience and songwriting. He was so brilliant, he would come up with about five songs in like 30 minutes, and every hook that he sang was amazing. He was so spontaneous and intelligent."
