Two-time world women's marathon champion Edna Kiplagat yesterday said they owe the country medals come the World Athletics Championships later this month in Doha. Kiplagat, who is the national marathon team captain, admitted that they have had good preparations and will no doubt be seeking to reciprocate Athletics Kenya's favour. "There is no doubt the country has invested heavily in our preparations and it's only fair we reciprocate when we line up in Doha," she added. Kiplagat will be chasing her third world title in Doha after winning in 2011 in Daegu and 2013 in Moscow. She also won a silver medal in 2017 in London. "As far as we are concerned, the country and the federation have done their part and it is now our time to return the favour," she added. Kiplagat said they have received whatever they needed for training and can't complain. "All I can say is that we are ready and I believe we will deliver," she noted. Kiplagat was speaking during a visit to the marathon camp by Athletics Kenya top brass headed by the  President Jack Tuwei. “We are grateful that these individuals accepted to represent our country in Doha and we came here today to hear from them one-on-one on how ready they are for the big show,” said Tuwei. He stated that there are two conditions for any athlete to represent the nation. "They must meet the testing conditions set out by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) and number two, they must have the qualification time," he added. He clarified that trials were by invitation and only those who had met the criteria were invited. "As a federation, we feel we did our level best and we selected only those who deserved places in Team Kenya having met all the conditions," said Tuwei. The AK supremo said they are in the process of relooking at the team to ensure everyone is in the best shape and focused for Doha.
