 Street children and orphans in Meru and Tharaka Nithi have been trained and funded to start businesses in an empowerment move by a non-governmental organisation. Zoe Kenya has also donated startup kits to the beneficiaries. More than 14,000 young people have been trained and given funds to start businesses. The group says the move is aimed at creating job opportunities for self-reliance. Zoe Kenya coordinator Reagan Kaberia said “We give them skills on farming, plumbing, masonry and hairdressing. We also have welders, drivers and mechanics," Zoe Kenya coordinator Reagan Kaberia said. Beneficiaries will be monitored for three years. "We provide them with cash, pay their rent and buy the startup tools. Next year we will be expanding our charity work to Embu and Laikipia counties,” Kaberia said. The NGO has been training youths and funding them to empower themselves and drive their families out of poverty. Kaberia said the civil service was aging because the government was not employing young people to take over. He said governments must ensure youths are incorporated and given resources to improve their communities. Kaberia asked counties and the national government to develop strategies to empower vulnerable children. “We ensure a follow up to strengthen them to work hard to earn a daily living. We give them an opportunity and it is upon the county and national governments to drive poverty out of our youths through employment opportunities." In August, 2,000 youths graduated after a Zoe Kenya training. Igembe South MP John Paul Mwirigi and Meru county secretary Rufus Miriti graced the event at Maua stadium.
