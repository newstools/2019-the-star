Deputy president William Ruto on Friday described his fierce critic, Cherangany MP Joshua Kutuny, as a lost son of the Kalenjin community. Speaking in Kalenjin in Kuttuny's Biribiriet village, Ruto said the MP is colluding with his enemies to kill him politically, adding that he is digging his own political grave. Ruto was addressing hundreds of residents during the burial of former New KCC director and politician Kibiwott Koross. "The work of your MP has become just making noise, but whether he is there or not the government will still deliver to the people of Cherangany because you voted for this government in large numbers," he said. Ruto was with Soy MP Caleb Kositany and his Kapseret counterpart Oscar Sudi. Others present were area Deputy Governor Stanley Tarus, Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa,former MPs Wesley korir, Kipruto Kirwa, politicians Noah Wekesa, Zipporah Kittony and Kakai Bisau. Kositany accused Kutuny of being contracted by 'forces' to spoil Ruto's votes in 2022.
