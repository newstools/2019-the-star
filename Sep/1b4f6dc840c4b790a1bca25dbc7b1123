The government has been urged to accelerate universal access to sexual reproductive health. The call was made in Naivasha ahead of the International Conference on People and Development (ICPD25) in November. Assistant Director of the National Council for Population and Development Beatrice Okundi said some communities were still practising harmful practices like FGM. Okundi noted the country had made major strides by putting in place laws and policies to address the archaic practices. “Though some communities are still practicing FGM and early marriages, we have seen a drop in the cases and the government is committed to ending this,” she said. On sexual productive health, the officer said that there was a need for a quality population and life, adding that long gone were days when families had over eight children. “We want to make sure that there is universal access to sexual reproductive health so that we can have quality families which can afford three meals per day,” she said. On the conference, she said 179 countries were expected to be represented. “The last conference was held in Cairo in 1994 but it has taken 25 years and we expect member countries to table their achievements in terms of population and development,” she added. Okundi said five thematic areas had been identified for the conference and they include sexual production health, end to gender-based violence and upholding sexual and reproductive health. “Each country has made its own achievement and in Kenya we are proud for women empowerment while the transition of girls from primary to secondary school has risen sharply,” she said.
