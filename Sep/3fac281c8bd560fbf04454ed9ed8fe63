Four more people have been arrested in connection with Sh72 million G4S heist. Simon Gichui, Florence Karuku, Caroline Waithera and Kenya Defence Forces officer Eunice Wangari were arrested on Thursday night. "A motor vehicle suspected to be proceeds of the crime was kept as Exhibit," DCI George Kinoti said in a tweet on Friday. Kinoti said the four are in police custody waiting to be arraigned. Detectives are investigating the theft of Sh72 million on transit from the G4S headquarters along Witu Road and an ATM in Nairobi West belonging to Standard Chartered Bank. The boxes and bags were found in Thogoto Forest, Kiambu county on September 5, 2019. On Monday last week, police arrested a G4S employee and Sh1 million was recovered buried in a cowshed in Lurambi, Kakamega county. The suspect, Bernard Sewanga, had gone into hiding.
