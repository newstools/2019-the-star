Our politicians tell us that to secure lasting peace and economic prosperity, there should be no opposition to the government of the day. That everything said and done against the government must be recanted and sanitised to look cool in the eye of the state. And more importantly, to eat with a big spoon and at the high table where the tenders the state dishes out to the blue-eyed boys and girls are agreed on. But where is the moral of making a lot of noise, causing havoc and deaths if you know all you want is recognition and to be part of the eating lot? Let us work with the government for the right reasons. Is it not tragic that our politics can be based on such forlorn ideology that generations upon generations are treated to theatrics in the name of leadership? I have more than once argued that politicians are taking Kenyans for a ride, spending fortunes chasing illusionary ‘peace’ when it is clear all that are their ego trips are fashioned in deception to hoodwink the gullible who are many but not the majority. Today we hear of lucrative tenders given to the same characters who were all over the place telling Kenyans how Jubilee was ripping this country apart. What really changed? Earlier, those who worked with the government ‘for development’s sake’ were told they went there for their own selfish interests. But today the shoe is on the other foot and the argument has been flipped that people are starting to reap development because of working with the government. Loyalty now means nothing. If this is not the height of hypocrisy, what is? It is what I call the politics of the stomach devoid of principle that Kenyans should reject if we are going to build a strong foundation for economic, political and social take-off.
