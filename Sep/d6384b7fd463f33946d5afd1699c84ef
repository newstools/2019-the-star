Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham has refused to rule out switching his allegiance to Nigeria. Along with Sergio Aguero, Abraham is currently the joint-leading scorer in the Premier League this season with seven goals, three of which came in Chelsea 5-2 victory away to Wolves on Saturday. Although he has been capped twice by England at senior level, Abraham has yet to play a competitive game for the Three Lions and there have been suggestions that he could change allegiance to Nigeria, who he is eligible to represent due to his heritage. Abraham said: “Yes, I have heard the talk. I have not really been focused on that yet. I think when the time comes, the times comes. It is about focusing on Chelsea and hopefully scoring goals and getting victories.” “We never know. You can never say never, whatever comes first really. I just have to keep full focus on Chelsea.” Abraham represented England at Under 18, Under 19 and Under 21 levels, winning the Toulon Tournament with the latter age group, but he is no longer eligible to play youth international football. The 21-year-old wasn’t included in the latest England senior squad but did play twice under Gareth Southgate in 2017 as he featured in friendlies against Germany and Brazil. After spells on loan at Bristol City, Swansea and Aston Villa, Abraham is finally getting a chance to lead the line for Chelsea. Having failed to score against Manchester United and Leicester (featuring as a substitute against the latter), he hit braces against Norwich and Sheffield United prior to his exploits against Wolves.
