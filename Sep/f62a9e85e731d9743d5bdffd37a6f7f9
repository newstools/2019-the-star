Comedian Njugush has weighed in on footballer-turned politician Mcdonald Mariga contesting for Kibra Member of Parliament. "It's good to be visionary. It's good to do stuff for people, but its also another work altogether to be your sort of man," the comic said. "If he can win the seat, then it’s up to him to prove that he can work." He said the problems the country is facing are because many of our leaders are in that position not because of their vision but their political connections. Njugush said Kibra had lost a visionary in Ken Okoth. "I liked the work he did, especially with bursaries for school kids. There is work that he was doing even in building schools. Right?" he said. "He wasn’t related to anyone and he was an honest Kenyan. The rest (other politicians) are just sideshows."
