Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reportedly labelled his Manchester United players ‘a joke’ after they were held to a draw by Southampton on Saturday afternoon. The under-pressure manager let rip at the team after they failed to find a winner in the 1-1 draw at St Mary’s, despite the home side having been reduced to 10 men with just under 20 minutes remaining in the game. And The Sun claim he told them their performance was a ‘joke’ and it was ‘embarrassing’ that they had failed to finish a team off once again. Aiming his verbal onslaught at the entire squad rather than individuals, Solskjaer also accused his players of playing for themselves — and too often trying the spectacular instead of sticking to the basics. The Norwegian also made it clear he feels there has been a lack of effort from certain players, who are letting their team-mates down. Saturday’s draw means the Red Devils have won just one of their opening four Premier League matches, a 4-0 thrashing of Chelsea followed by a draw at Wolves and a shock defeat at home by Crystal Palace. Eighth-placed United already sit seven points behind arch-rivals Liverpool, who top the table after picking up 12 points from 12. Their next game is at home to Leicester on September 14, following the international break.
