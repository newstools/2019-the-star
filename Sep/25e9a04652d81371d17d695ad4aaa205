It will now be difficult to dislodge leaders Thunder from the top of the Premier League, coach Collins Gaya insists. Thunder are five points above second-placed Ulinzi Warriors after bagging 36 points following their 89-65 win over Emyba at Nyayo Stadium over the weekend. “We have now taken a strong lead at the top of the table and I can confirm to you that this team has what it takes to go all the way,” he said. It was their second league triumph in two days after having whipped struggling World Hope 58-41 at the same venue on Saturday. “Emyba gave us all sorts of problems in the first leg and only a point separated the two teams. We were prepared for them even if it meant going full-court press,” said Gaya. “We got off well in the first quarter but we played garbage in the second. In the third, we stopped them from the top of the key where they were killing us and won it.” Thunder were up 21-16 in the first quarter but trailed 25-14 in the second. They stormed away to a 31-16 and 23-8 difference after the breather. Veteran Ancette Wafula sunk 23 points, Kevin Chogo nailed 22 and national team captain and point guard Griffin Ligare dropped 14 for Thunder. Emyba lost direction after Eric Odhiambo was ejected. They were pepped by Tony Mwenda who registered 24 points and Emmanuel Ekai who shot 14. Joseph Ondinyo, Emyba assistant coach said they lost concentration late in the third quarter after failing to maintain the tide they had build. Reigning women champions Equity Bank won 71-57 over Storms as Betty Kananu led with 22 points while Lynette Atieno made the losers 16. Western Delight had 22 points from Sandra Ekasimba and 16 from Shilalei Shani in a 46-36 victory over Tangit Sparks. In Mombasa, Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) dismantled visiting Zetech University 64-34 at the Makande Welfare Hall. In the lower division, Kenya Christian Industrial Training Institute (KCITI) blanked Little Prince 58-30 as University of Nairobi pipped Zetech University  57-56.
