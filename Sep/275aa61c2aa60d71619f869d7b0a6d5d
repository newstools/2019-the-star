A suspect linked to the importation of counterfeit goods using fake KRA stamps was released yesterday on Sh2 million bail. Jane Gichengo, a shipping company agent, was charged with the importation of concealed goods on April 26. She is accused of importing counterfeit goods that have 900,000 ready to drink excise duty stamps and 960,000 counterfeit spirits excise duty stamps concealed as labelling stickers, among other goods at the JKIA. The accused denied the charges before chief magistrate Francis Andayi and was granted Sh2 million bail or an alternative Sh3 million bond. She said she is a single mother of schoolchildren. The case will be mentioned on September 30. According to the Kenya Revenue Authority prosecution, the value of the stamps was not indicated in the charges as they cannot value counterfeit stamps. Muthoni was arrested on Friday last week at JKIA upon arrival from China. According to KRA, the accused is part of a criminal network that manufactures excise stamps in China and consigns them to Kenya under concealment.Â The taxman said that the manufactured stamps are distributed through a locally-based cartel. The cartel, KRA said, distributes stamps to alcohol manufacturers and distributors who end up evading taxes. On April 24, 2019, officers from KRA acting on intelligence intercepted a consignment containing 11 packages of counterfeit excise stamps at JKIA imported from China. The consignment declared as 189 packages containing mobile phone accessories valued at $3,750 had been exported by Jia Mei International Trade in China and consigned to Buush Investments Limited in Kenya. During the joint verification of the consignment, KRA and Revenue Protection Services officers found concealed counterfeit excise stamps and other undeclared goods consolidated.
