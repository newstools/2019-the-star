Two people were arrested on Wednesday in connection with a drug syndicate in Nairobi. Mohamed Kebbay, 23, and Jogy Fondo, 29, were nabbed by Directorate of Criminal Investigations officials in Riruta, Dagoreti South. The detectives also confiscated more than 68 tubes of suspected cocaine, several sachets of bhang and Kamagra oral jelly. According to a DCI report seen by the Star, the intelligence-led operation also led to the seizure of several brown cookies believed to have been baked using the drugs, 508 empty tubes for packaging, a weighing machine, three laptops, and some envelopes. The police immediately launched investigations. Elsewhere in Kilimani, Nairobi, police officers seized fake $1 million and 147 gold bars at a nightclub. A detective told the Star they raided Plan 254 Club on Wednesday night and found the consignment. They arrested club owner Steve Oduk. The officer said the raid followed a tip-off by a foreigner who had been asked to visit the club to purchase gold bars. "We had been tipped that a Kenyan businessman, Oduk, was selling the bars to the foreigner. We struck in time, made the arrest and seized exhibit," he said. The source divulged that the fake money and gold had been kept inside a room within the club. Oduk is to be arraigned on Friday. He was locked up at the Kilimani police station as investigations continue. (Edited by F'Orieny)
