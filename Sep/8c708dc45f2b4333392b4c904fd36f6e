Three excavators worth Sh43 million have been seized by police in Mombasa county. Detectives from Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) confiscated the equipment for allegedly being fraudulently imported into the country. Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti said the excavators were confiscated in Changamwe on Saturday. They had been imported from India. “The shipment was done by JCB International who upon delivering the goods, contacted the brother company in Kenya for payment. It’s then that they learnt that the company doesn’t deal with such goods. Investigations commenced and led to the arrest of the suspect and recovery of the excavators,” the DCI said. The detectives from Nairobi were following a complaint from London where a company complained of fraud in the exercise. Kinoti said the excavators were shipped into the country after fraudsters hacked into the email of the vehicles manufacturer’s company, which is based in London before placing an order for them. A suspect, Nobert Njeru was arrested during the excavators’ seizing.
