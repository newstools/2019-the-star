            Susan Kirui will be representing Kenya in Miss Earth Kenya in Manila, Philippines, late this month. Susan was crowned Miss Earth Kenya 2018, and she will now represent the country in a month-long competition. Speaking to Word Is, Susan said she had never participated and when she tried, luckily, she got crowned. She says the journey has not been easy, as when she started, she lost friends she expected would walk with her. "I have been trolled and even been told I could not make it. Like I remember even my buddies did not show up for the crowning," she said. "All that matters is who you are and what you want to achieve." Susan will hold a send-off fashion show on Saturday towards her travel in the Philippines. The theme will be African Casual.
