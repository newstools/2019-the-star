The prosecution in Keroche CEO’s tax evasion case has been directed to supply the defence with witness statements by Wednesday. The order by chief magistrate Martha Mutuku came despite an application by prosecutor Catherine Mwaniki for another 10 days to supply the defence with all the documents. Mutuku ordered the case to proceed on October 8. Following the order, Keroche owners Joseph and Tabitha Karanja Muigai have faulted the office of the DPP for failing to supply them with witness statements and other exhibits as ordered on August 23. This is the second time a pretrial failed. Defence counsel James Orengo protested the delay in supply of the documents and exhibits a month after charges were preferred against the brewer's top officials. Orengo said the prosecution is in a hurry to arrest "but are very slow in furnishing the defence with witness statements". Joseph and Tabitha denied tax evasion charges and were released on bail. Tabitha also denied the charges on behalf of the company, Keroche Breweries, since four other directors were not in court. They are alleged to have committed the tax-related offences between February 20, 2015 and July 20, 2019, amounting to Sh14.5 billion. The prosecution alleges that the accused were involved in fraud by posting incorrect statements on excise duty, hence reducing the company’s tax liability. Keroche Breweries is said to have failed to pay excise duty and Value Added Tax on some of its products including Vienna Ice, Crescent Vodka and Summit beers as well as duty stamps. The court then directed Joseph to post Sh2 million bail and Karanja Sh10 million, and a further Sh15 million on behalf of the company. Edited by R.Wamochie
