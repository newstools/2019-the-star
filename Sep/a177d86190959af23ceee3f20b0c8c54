A Kiambu magistrate on Friday granted one of five accused persons more time to negotiate with the complainant in a conspiracy to defraud Sh88.7 million worth of laptops. Senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo allowed an application by Mapili David who is the first accused in the case. He said he needed more time to settle the matter out of court. He told the court that he had started negotiation with the complainant  Idris Ahmed Buro. Mapili is charged along side Mercy Wanjiku, Jackson Kiharo, Michael Okongo and Alex Mutia Kesyoka who are not part to the negotiation. They have since denied defrauding Buro of Sh88,784,340 through fake government tenders. The prosecution did not oppose Mapili's request to be give more time to finalise negotiations with the complainant. The magistrate directed the case to be mention on October 18 to confirm the position of negotiation. She also advised the other accused persons to join Mapili in the out court settlement. Earlier, defence lawyers led by Lewis Kanyoko had opposed an application by the prosecution to release the laptops to the alleged owner. The prosecutor said all the laptops detained by police should be released to the complainant  since he has already testified. But defence lawyers objected the request, saying although their clients are not claiming ownership, they want the laptops not be released until the case is heard and determined.
