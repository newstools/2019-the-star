The Marsabit government, the National Drought Management Authority and the Community Initiative Facilitation and Assistance have flagged off water bowsers to quench the thirst of Moyale residents. The area has been ravaged by the drought. Five water bowsers, each with a capacity of 16,000 litres, and two lorries of animal feed were flagged off on Tuesday by county secretary Malich Boru in Sololo Makutano. Boru assured residents that the government is committed to end the water shortage by replacing old pumps that are prone to breakages, drilling of boreholes, distillation of dams and construction of more dams to ensure uninterrupted water supply. He said the county government will continue providing humanitarian aid, saying that elders should help local NGOs identify the needs of the community. Water executive Joseph Wako said the government plans to construct a mega dam in Sololo. He said the department has constructed a number of dams and drilled boreholes.  The vast county has only 132 boreholes. County NDMA coordinator Guyo Golicha said the national government is  providing residents with monthly cash transfers. He said 6,360 households in Moyale subcounty receive Sh5,400 monthly. He urged residents who missed out on the last registration of households to register themselves at the chief's office. CIFA has distributed 600 bags of animal feed to pastoralists in Moyale subcounty. CIFA programme manager Mutua Jafrey said they will in the next few weeks distribute more than 2176 bags of animal feed to the remaining subcounties.
