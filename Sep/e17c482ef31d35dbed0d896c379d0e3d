Juventus have been handed a boost during the international break as manager Maurizio Sarri’s recovery from pneumonia saw him ‘partially’ take charge of training. The club released a statement and the session saw a limited number of players take part given many of Juventus’ squad are away on international duty. But for Sarri, who has been absent from the dugout for the Old Lady’s opening two Serie A matches, the session was another step towards full fitness as he looks to return to work. Assistant manager Giovanni Martusciello had taken his place for the Parma and Napoli matches, both of which were won by Juventus. Sarri, while recovering from the illness, previously watched training sessions via videolink but is now of the fitness to be at the training pitches himself. The likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Matthijs de Ligt are away while Gonzalo Higuain and Douglas Costa will return to training on Friday after being handed an additional two days off, the Juventus statement added. Sarri’s first game back in the dugout in Serie A is expected to be the trip to Florence to face Fiorentina on September 14. The Italian champions will then kick-start their Uefa Champions League campaign against Atletico Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano four days later.
