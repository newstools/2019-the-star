The Kenya Under 15 National team safely jetted back into the country on Saturday evening from Eritrea where they came second at the maiden CECAFA U15 Championships. Kenya lost 4-0 in the final at the hands of Uganda in the inaugural edition of the junior regional competition which coach Sagar Lakhani noted was insightful with lessons to be learned. “This tournament is a huge part of the boys’ learning experience. We are very excited to have come this far and we have learned that there is a lot of work to be done moving forward,” said coach Sagar Lakhani. Captain James Gachago, who played every minute of the team’s campaign, noted that the players had an experience of a lifetime in Eritrea capital Asmara. “It was a great experience. Despite losing in the final, we not only did our best but also enjoyed ourselves on the pitch. We just need to work more together and nothing will stop us from achieving our goal,” said the captain. FKF President Nick Mwendwa said "despite their good show, its not about results for U15 yet. The time is coming, picture them 10 years from today playing together through all junior ranks with a few additions as they go on , Watch out for them." Goalkeeper Alvin Odari scooped the best keeper’s prize.
