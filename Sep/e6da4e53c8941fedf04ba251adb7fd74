Napuu II irrigation scheme in Lodwar, Turkana county, has proved that the semi-arid area that is always in the news because of famine can actually feed its people. In the latest drought that ravaged the county for six months, over 805,000 people out of a population of 1.2 million were affected by famine. But on Saturday, residents gathered huge harvests at the scheme managed by Kerio Valley Development Authority. They recorded a bumper harvest of sorghum, cow peas, maize and green grams. Samuel Naporos, acting managing director of Napuu II irrigation project, said they had so far harvested 15 tonnes of sorghum, 10 tonnes of green grams, maize and cow peas. “We are looking forward to put 5,000 acres of land under irrigation in a period of five years that will eradicate poverty and dependency," he said. Water is fully available and the new phase will feed the entire county, Naporos said while launching the harvesting of sorghum on Saturday. He called upon local leaders and farmers to cooperate to end food insecurity in Turkana. Turkana county KVDA director Fransisca Ereng asked for more funding to train residents to move from pastoralism to agro-pastoralism. Turkana Central MP John Lodepe lauded the irrigation project, calling upon the national government to provide more funds to KVDA. “For President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda to succeed, the national government should provide funds to authorities like KVDA that are able to work with the people to realise the food security in the country,” he said. Pauline Akiru, a resident of Napuu village, said the harvest will reduce their dependancy on relief food.
