Business owners have expressed concern over the growing number of beggars on the streets of Embu town. The beggars, said to be Tanzanians, are accused of blocking shop verandahs and scaring away customers. County Chamber of Commerce chairman John Mate said the beggars, who are disabled, have become a menace to businesspeople. A spot check by the Star in Embu town on Wednesday revealed that some of the beggars use infants to attract sympathy from passersby. The business community wants police to investigate a possible extortion ring running its activities through the beggars. Mate said a cartel operating in Embu, Kerugoya and Chuka towns was using beggars for their own selfish ends. He said the business community will storm houses where the beggars are housed if police will not act. "We already raised the matter with the police and other relevant authorities including the county government and the Department of Children's Services. If they are not going to work on this menace we will take it upon ourselves," Mate said. Embu west subcounty police commander Julius Meli told the Star officers were aware of the influx and were conducting investigations. "It's true their number in town is worrying and this raises a concern. We are going to make arrests soon and deport those found to be here illegally," Meli said. Boda boda operators said they have been hired on many occasions to pick and drop the beggars. "We take all of them to a particular one-roomed house," said Chris Murithi, a boda boda operator. Taxi operators fear that the influx of beggars in the county is an indication that some unscrupulous individuals are using them to make quick money.
