The youth comprise a huge portion of the countryâ€™s population. Many of them have talents that can support their lifestyles and earn them a living. The government should come up with strategies on how to support the generation. Some of their talents are innovative enough to contribute to the realisation of the Big Four agenda. State should offer them financial backing. There is a need for money to be set aside for upcoming athletes during preparation. We only hear about a certain athlete when they win but we do little in helping them prepare for victory. Prosperous athletes should be on the forefront in supporting upcoming ones. The government should nurture talent in all sectors to reduce the number of idle youths, most of whom have recently graduated from college.  Mombasa
