Two northern white rhino embryos have been successfully matured and fertilised in a bid to save the species, Kenya Wildlife Service has said. "For decades the story of the northern white rhinoceros has been a tale of decline...the two embryos were created using eggs from Fatu," KWS said in a tweet on Wednesday. There are only two northern white rhinos left worldwide, both of them female Najin and Fatu. "Today is an incredibly exciting day: We have just turned the corner with successful laboratory creation of two northern white rhino embryos in Italy,' KWS said. "Entire team has been developing and planning these procedures for years, and this development marks an important breakthrough." Tourism CS Najib Balala said the government is greatly encouraged by breaking of new ground in the assisted reproduction technique and remains committed to facilitating the pioneering process all the way. "It has been decade of race against time," he said. The concerted efforts to save the species started following health deterioration of Sudan in 2018. Sudan, the world's last standing male, died on March 19, 2018, at the age of 45 years at Ol Pejeta Conservancy. In 2009, Sudan and another male named Suni, and two females — who were, in fact, Sudan’s daughter Najin and granddaughter Fatu — were relocated to Kenya.
