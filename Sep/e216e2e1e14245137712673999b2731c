Lamu MPs have embarked on a campaign to attract investors to the county ahead of the launch of the first berth of the new port next month. President Uhuru Kenyatta will commission the Lapsset berth on October 20 in an event that will witness the first-ever cargo ship dock at the new port. MPs Stanley Muthama (Lamu West), Athman Shariff (Lamu East) and Woman Rep Ruweida Obbo have appealed to investors to rush to Lamu to take advantage of the expected business boom. The leaders have promised adequate security and a conducive environment for business. They lauded the national government for winning the war on al Shabaab, saying  Lamu is now safe. “We acknowledge what the government has done to ensure the issue of insecurity is efficiently addressed and we are impressed. We are calling on investors from all over Kenya and the world to come to Lamu and take advantage of the Lapsset. There are major opportunities to be tapped into for the good of Lamu and Kenya as a whole,” Muthama said. Lamu East MP Shariff said completion of the first berth will open up Lamu to more trade. “We are confident that Lamu will soon turn into a trade and industry hub and join the likes of Mombasa and others. We are excited as leaders and hopeful that all these will lift up the county economically and in many other ways. We are talking about increased tourism. This is the perfect place to invest now,” he said. Woman Rep Obbo said residents should be given the first priority in employment opportunities. “We are welcoming investors to Lamu but at the same time we are urging them to uplift our youth by giving them jobs in the various projects they choose to start. No need to source for manpower from outside when we have plenty,” she said.
