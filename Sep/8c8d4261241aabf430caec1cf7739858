The High Court has ruled that the image of late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta used on the new currency notes is not a portrait as had been alleged. The court ruled that the statue is indeed part of KICC. Justices Kanyi Kimondo and Asenath Ongeri said that CBK has not breached the law in using the said image. Judge Kimondo also noted that the said image in contention was a side view and not frontal. He also notes that there is another image of an individual in one of the other new currencies. The court has also ruled that there was adequate public participation in the printing of the new design The majority judges also rule that CBK had the power to withdraw the old 1000 notes even though it did not go through public participation. They had the discretion to withdraw which has to have a form of surprise. "The period of four months deadline was in our view reasonable," they read the judgement.
