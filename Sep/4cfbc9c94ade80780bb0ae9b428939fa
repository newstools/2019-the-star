West Pokot speaker Catherine Mukenyang has assured residents that the county assembly sittings will resume after differences between county staff and MCAs are resolved. The county assembly has been adjourned for two weeks and residents want the house to resume for the smooth running of the county. Mukenyang said that the house was forced to adjourn sittings to solve in-house wrangles. “The MCAs and assembly staff have been differing on certain issues and we wanted to solve the problem,” she said. She said the adjournment was indefinite until the speaker, MCAs, leader of majority and minority agree on when to resume the sittings. “The speaker has powers to adjourn sittings when the rules of the house are not adhered to,” she said. Mukenyang said there was a need for the staff and members of the county assembly to work together. She said that the adjournment had not affected the business of the house since they had less work during this period. “Work that is before the house is the finance bill and before end of this month the bill will be ready,” she said. However, a section of MCAs from the county assembly was planning to impeach the speaker over what they termed as abuse of office. The MCAS claim that the speaker adjourned the house indefinitely after she realised that 24 members had prepared a motion to disband the assembly service board.
