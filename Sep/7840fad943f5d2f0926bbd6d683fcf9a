The High Court will on November 8 determine how former Cabinet Minister Mbiyu Koinange's Sh10 billion estate will be distributed. Parties in the case appeared before Justice Aggrey Muchelule yesterday and confirmed that they had all filed documents proposing how the estate should be distributed. The judge subsequently directed all the beneficiaries to be present in court on November 8 when he will give his decision. Among the properties to be distributed are shares at Koinange Investments and Development Ltd, shares at Koira Ltd, Kenyattu Trading company Ltd, and shares at Centum, among others. Other properties to be shared are 4,292 acres of Muthera Farm, 640 acres Ehothia Farm (both of which are in Mau Narok- Nakuru county), Thimbigua farm (96 acres), Closeburn Estate (commercial plots- 10 acres), Closeburn Estate (farm– 176 acres), Ikinu farm (11 acres), Thimbigwa plot, Banana Hill plot, among others. The protracted legal battle has dragged in court for more than three decades. The dispute started in 1983, two years after Koinange’s death when two women moved to court to be included as wives. In 2015, High Court Justice William Musyoka ruled that Margaret and Eddah were not legally married to Koinange and stripped them of any claim to the estate. He also revoked Koinange’s property owned by the two women. But in December last year, Appellate Judges Philip Waki, Asike Makhandia and Kathurima M’Inoti overturned the High Court decision and recognised the two women as Koinange’s widows. The Court of Appeal subsequently directed the case be returned to the High Court for distribution. The appeal judges cancelled an earlier distribution of the assets by Justice William Musyoka, saying he had not recognised the two women as widows of Koinange. (edited by O. Owino)
