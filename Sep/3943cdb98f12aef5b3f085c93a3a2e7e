Embu deputy governor David Kariuki has assured squatters in the disputed Mwea Settlement Scheme that none of them will be evicted. Kariuki said the county is working with the national government to ensure the rights of everybody who lives in the scheme are protected. He said the government is looking into redistribution of the land after the exercise was stopped by the Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i and his Land colleague Farida Karoney last year in April. The directive followed the death of a man and several other people after they clashed over the land that has been disputed for a decade. Kariuki asked the residents to maintain peace as the government looks into the issue noting that bloodshed will not be allowed. “Issues pertaining to this land have been hot for a long time. I want to assure you that nobody will be evicted from the place he or she calls home,” Kariuki said. “How can you be removed from a place where you have built your house and have sired children? Where should you be taken?” he asked. The deputy governor spoke at Mbodoni during a public meeting attended by the Makima MCA Philip Nzangi, Mwea's Harrison Mwaruko and Kengen Eastern manager Julius Odumbe. A Sh108 million piped water project jointly sponsored by the county government and Kengen was deliberated upon at the meeting. He said those who have been inciting people to fight will be dealt with accordingly. The deputy county chief said the over 100km tarmac ring road which has stalled in most parts of Mbeere South will be commenced soon from Piai and Machanga by two contractors. The contractor on the Mbeere South side had his contract terminated for failing to render good services. Edited by R.Wamochie
