A man linked to the 2014 Thika Road terrorist attack in which three commuters died has been jailed for 14 years. Sar Guracha Haro and his son Warque Dejene had last month been acquitted of the terror attack involving two buses on Thika Road. “The accused (Haro) will serve 14 years imprisonment but since he has been in custody for four years, he will spend 10 years in custody,” Nairobi chief magistrate Francis Andayi ruled on Friday. Haro was convicted of threatening a witness who testified against his son. The witness did not show up to testify as a result. Andayi said threatening the witness was a threat to the criminal justice system. “Laws will be broken and people will then commit crime with the comfort that no one will testify, hence escape punishment.” Haro and Dejene had been accused of placing explosives in two commuter buses at Homeland and Roysambu. Three passengers died. Dejene received terrorism training in Kismayu, Somalia, in 2014.
