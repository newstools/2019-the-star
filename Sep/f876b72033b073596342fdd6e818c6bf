Jubilee Party members from Busia and Siaya counties have opposed efforts to review the Constitution, terming it a waste of time and resources. Led by party officials George Ogando and Washington Alunga, the members said that the government should address the health sector woes, youth unemployment among other issues. They addressed the media after holding a two-hour meeting in Busia Town on Thursday. They said they will only support a constitutional review that will improve the livelihood of Kenyans. “We are not going to support a constitutional change that aims at creating positions for some individuals and leave the majority of Kenyans suffering,” Ogando said. Ogando, however, proposed changes to strengthen the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to avert electoral malpractices. "I propose that we go back to the Constitution and make some changes on the commission including giving it more powers,” he said. The over 100 members also endorsed Deputy President William Ruto's bid to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022. "We are going to stand with DP Ruto and campaign for him in this region and ensure he captures the presidency," he said. They dismissed the narrative that Busia county is an Orange Democratic Movement zone. The leaders said every Kenyan has a right to support a political party of their choice.
