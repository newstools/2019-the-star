The Kenyan trio of Ng'eno Kipngetich, Emmanuel Korir and Ferguson Rotich have booked places in the semi finals of the 800m World Athletics Championships at the Khalifa International Stadium Doha Qatar. This is after they emerged winners in their heats. Despite Nigel Amos last minute withdrawal, Kipngetich says the Kenyan team should not rest on their laurels. Amos who was deemed as the pre-race favorite pulled out on the eve of the heat citing an Achilies injury. "We can not say his exit is an advantage to us.We have other athletes who are also seeking to win medals in the race.I am happy to be in the semis and I am looking to give my best tomorrow and grace the finals."Korir said He added, "It was a good race, I enjoyed it and I am happy the three of us made it to the finals.We will now work as a team from tomorrow's race and the target remains a clean sweep in the finals". Korir is sixth on the world all-time list and the second-fastest Kenyan ever behind Rudisha after clocking 1:42.05 last year. While Rotich is the  2016 Diamond League trophy winner and second on this year’s world list with 1:42.54, World Under-20 silver medalist Ngeno who floored many top names at the Kenyan trials to get a slot in the national team is seen as an additional advantage to the team. While Korir has not won any race this season and ran a season’s best of 1:43.69 for fourth place at the Zurich Diamond League meeting last month, Rotich has been unpredictable at the major championships with three World Championships finals without a medal. So far Kenya remains at the top of the table with one gold scooped by Ruth Chepngetich.
