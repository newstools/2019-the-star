Kenya Forest Service has cautioned Embu residents against an alleged organised cartel hoodwinking area institutions with donations of forest products. The alleged cartel, targeting learning, business, church and charity institutions, is said to be promising to donate timber, fencing poles and firewood. KFS head of eastern region conservancy Beatrice Mbula told journalists at her offices in Njukiri, Embu that the conmen were claiming to be officials from KFS. "They have been able to hide under the KFS umbrella and hoodwink institutions and residents that they were able to donate forest products," she said. The KFS boss noted that institutions like schools, churches and children homes were easy targets because they mostly operate with donations. She called on members of the public to volunteer useful information that would lead to arrests. Mbula revealed that a sheikh in Embu town had already been conned Sh10,000 while another institution has lost Sh3,000 ostensibly for fuel to deliver timber. "I want to warn the public that Kenya Forest Service is not donating any forest products," she said. She added that KFS is a government institution and, "we don't ask for money from the public to give them services." Mbula said that they had reported the matter to Embu police station and police have taken up the matter for investigations.
