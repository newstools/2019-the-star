Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu beat Serena Williams 6-3 7-5 in the U.S. Open final on Saturday to claim her first Grand Slam title and stop the American's bid to equal the all-time record. The hard-hitting Andreescu matched Williams' power throughout the slugfest and fended off a late comeback from the six-times U.S. Open champion to claim victory. The 19-year-old dropped her racket after hitting a winner on match point to seal victory at Arthur Ashe Stadium and collapsed on her back after embracing her defeated opponent. Andreescu, who becomes the first Canadian woman to win a major in the professional era, prevented Williams from equalling Margaret Court's record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles.
