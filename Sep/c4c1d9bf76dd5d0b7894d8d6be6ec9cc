Mauro Icardi’s wife Wanda Nara believes such is the allure of Paris Saint-Germain that ‘no one can say no’ to the French champions. The troublesome Argentine striker was in limbo for much of the transfer window after being deemed surplus to requirements under Antonio Conte at Inter Milan. He joined PSG on loan on deadline day and with Nara in the stands watching on, made his debut as a second-half substitute against Strasbourg on Saturday. “They’re a top club and our children are very happy too,” Nara told mediaset television show Tika Taka. “No-one can say ‘no’ to PSG. Out of all the possible destinations, they were the best in a logistical sense.” PSG, with Neymar back in the side after his failed return to Barcelona, struggled to break down a dogged Strasbourg side at the Parc des Princes before the Brazilian produced some late magic to win it. Fans voiced their discontent towards him throughout but with Icardi thrown on in support for the final 30 minutes, Neymar scored an overhead kick in the 92nd minute to secure a 1-0 win. “I’m very happy, the match went well,” Nara added. “Neymar’s goal was crazy. I didn’t know the stadium that well, but there was a great welcome for Mauro and the curva supported the team from start to finish.”
