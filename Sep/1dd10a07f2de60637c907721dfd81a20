Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has shut down St Catherine Bombolulu Primary School in Kibra constituency for having weak structures. Magoha said the school had similarities with the collapsed classroom at Precious Talent School in Dagoretti, Nairobi County. "I have been to every classroom. I have been on the floor of the building the and basically, there is no difference from the structure that collapsed," Magoha said. Magoha spoke on Wednesday while on a tour of the area to inspect school structures. He said that according to his findings, the school building appeared not to have been approved by anybody and the structure was not registered. The CS added that the school did not have TSC registered teachers. Magoha closedÂ Precious Talent Primary until Monday after inspection of the institution was finished. Magoha's move came hours before Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko suspended 16 county officials following the tragedy. Through a statement on Wednesday, Sonko suspended the officials to pave way for investigations.
