Kenya's Ministry of Education officials and their South African counterparts are developing a framework to introduce the teaching of Kiswahili in Pretoria's educational system. The framework also provides exchanges on the improvement of quality of basic education in the two countries. According to a press release, the framework is based on Memorandum of Understanding the two governments signed to facilitate technical exchanges on education. In May,Â  Education CS George Magoha signed the MoU with South Africa's Minister for Basic Education Angelina Matsie Motshekga. The discussions on the development of the implementation framework of the MoU were led by director general for Basic Education Elyas Abdi on behalf of Kenyan team, while South African delegation was led by the director general for Basic Education HM Mweli. Study visits, workshops and exchange of information will form the basis of technical exchanges. Some of the areas that will form the basis of collaboration would be the digital learning programme, quality assurance and assessment, education information management system (EMIS), and special and inclusive education, among others. When signing the MoU in May, Motshekga said that about 40 per cent of learners in South African speak Kiswahili. She noted that the MoU would make it possible for learners in South African to take up Kiswahili as an optional language besides French and Portuguese languages.
