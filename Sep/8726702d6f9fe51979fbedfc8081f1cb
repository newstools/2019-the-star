Kirundi & Co Advocates on Friday declined to reveal the contents of Dutch businessman Tob Cohen's will to the media, saying they were part of a court process. Lawyer Chege Kirundi, the custodian of the will, said the media was gagged and he therefore would not divulge the contents. Cohen's sister Gabrielle van Straten, her lawyer Cliff Ombeta and brother Bernard and Roy arrived at the lawyer's office in the morning for the opening of the will. Cohen's widow, Sarah Wairimu, had through her lawyer Philip Murgor, protested against the authenticity of the will. Kirundi proceeded to reveal the sealed Will after waiting in vain for Murgor to show up. The opening of the Will will be a private affair. A letter signed by Kirundi & Co Advocates invited Murgor to the reading at Kirundi Advocates' offices on the ninth floor of Bruce House on Standard Street in the CBD. Murgor said his client doubted the motive of the Will reading, because the confidentiality of the document had been impugned after the Star, citing a Dutch newspaper, published its contents on September 16. "It is evidence that the confidential nature of the will you claim to possess or any others for that matter has been severely compromised, to the extent that our client has instructed us to inform you that she does not wish to participate in any related process," the letter read. The Star had reported that Cohen, at the time estranged from his wife, had given his sister his Sh400 million Kitisuru villa.
