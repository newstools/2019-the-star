Rapper Kristoff has denied allegations by Effect Gang that he, Yvonne Darq and Kush Tracey sampled their beat and passed it off as their original production. Members of Effect Gang, a hip hop crew, blasted him on Twitter. "I hear there is a certain artiste who has stolen our song. Man, and the way we have suffered to get to where we are,” they said. “The song is called 'Bash' and it is a sample of our track also titled 'Bash'. Even the chorus is similar to our single.” In a press statement, Kristoff defended the song. “Kristoff’s management has not taken the allegations politely as such indictment is jeopardising to their clients’ brand, and want the ‘gang’ to withdraw their statement or legal pursuit will be taken up. “There are better, mature and professional ways to get attention and collaborations for upcoming artistes looking to merge with growing and/or established artistes. “'Bash' was scripted and recorded four months ago, May 2019, to be precise. The video was shot in August 2019 and a trailer announcing the release was published on September 12, 2019. It is a copyrighted track under Kecobo.” According to digital mediums, the ‘Gang’ joined YouTube on Wednesday last week, with 39 subscribers as of Saturday. The first video was published by VDJ Jones as a promotion video on Saturday after the release of Kristoff's music video a day prior. "The management suspects that the DJ involved in Kristoff’s collabo with 'Boondocks' remix to their song ‘RIENG’ could be behind this ‘sampling' saga,” the statement said.
