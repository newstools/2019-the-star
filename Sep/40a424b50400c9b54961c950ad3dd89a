Controversial Kiss FM presenter Andrew Kibe says he has not seen the son he sired with his first baby mam   a for seven years now. Kibe says the woman got mad at him after she learnt that he had already moved on after breaking up with her. During Kiss FM's breakfast show, Kamene Goro asked, "Who are you throwing under the bus this morning?" Kibe said he sired a child with his ex-wife (first wife). "We produced a very strong offspring. Until five years old, I was given the chance to see him. I later married another lady and my kid’s mother cut me off. Since then, I have never seen my child for 7-12 years." Speaking to Word Is yesterday, he responded to why he thinks the woman denied him access. Kibe said he broke her heart. "She thought I would marry her, only for me to marry another woman, and I think that is what angered her," he said. "She denied me access to my offspring. Now that is somebody I want to throw in front of a bus, and in case you (she) survive the ‘accident’, I will step on her," he said. He says the alienation has disturbed him for a long time. "You want me to get emotional." One of the listeners responded to Andrew Kibe’s remarks, saying, "That’s very harsh. I don’t believe there’s a reason enough for someone to deny their child to see or spend time with their dad." Kibe's message to women who deny men access to their children is, "It is very unfair for any responsible man to be denied access to their child. And any woman who does that ni mwendaa (mad)."
