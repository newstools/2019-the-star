 Private investigator Jane Wawira Mugo on Wednesday denied threatening to kill two people. The chief executive of Trimo Security Limited allegedly threatened to kill Patrick Mugusia Kefa on August 15. Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi heard that Mugo also threatened to kill Deepa Shah on February 4 at Kyuna Close, Spring Valley, in Gigiri. The state asked the court to order her to present herself at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) for firearm verification and fingerprints taking. Mugo's lawyers Danstan Omari and Cliff Ombeta said they will present take her to the DCI for fingerprinting on Thursday at 2pm. The lawyers said, “She is one of the police, undercover, she cannot escape.” However, they objected to the prosecution's request to have her appear at the DCI, saying firearms verification should be done at the Firearms Licensing Board. Mugo has previously been charged with detaining a man after obtaining Sh44,000 from him. She has also been accused of abducting a Nairobi businessman, locking him up in her Baba Dogo office and forcing him to pay Sh400,000. That allegedly happened in 2015. Another previous charge against Mugo is that of drawing a gun and threatening to kill a man on allegations that he was spying on a relative of the director of a company where she worked for as a private investigator. Andayi released her on Sh200,000 bail or Sh300,000 bond. The DCI had last week declared Mugo a wanted criminal and ordered her arrest for alleged robbery with violence, impersonation and threatening to kill. Three of her employees were in 2016 accused of violently robbing a man of Sh90,000 after introducing themselves as police officers.
