@robertomollo3  The government has been told to stop purchasing free condoms and instead use the cash to buy sanitary pads for schoolgirls. MPs Lillian Gogo (Rangwe) and Eve Obara (Kabondo Kasipul) on Saturday said sanitary towels had become a basic need for girls compared to free condoms. “It’s mandatory that a girl experiences menses at puberty. But it’s not a must they engage in sex hence the need for the government to focus on giving free pads and not condoms,” Gogo said. They spoke in Rangwe during the burial of Gogo's brother-in-law Daniel Nyachiro. The lawmaker said sanitary pads will make it easy for schoolgirls, especially those from poor families to remain in school, during menses. Gogo said many girls suffer during their menstrual circle due to lack of the sanitary pads and that the suffering had even pushed some to suicide. “The distribution of free sanitary pads to school girls is not much effective. Let’s divert funds spend on condoms to the sanitary pads to cushion school girls from the humiliation they undergo when parents fail to buy the pads,” Gogo said. She said those engaging in sex have a choice unlike girls who must undergo menstruation. She urged people who want to engage in sex to seek  VCT services for confirmation of their status to avoid sexually transmitted infections. “Use of condoms is voluntary because somebody can opt to adhere to information from a VCT center to be sure of their HIV status before sex. But menstruation for girls is a must." Obara urged the government to intensify the distribution of sanitary towels to schools so girls can concentrate on their studies. “Girl child education should be given the necessary support by the government and all stakeholders,” Obara said.  edited by peter obuya
