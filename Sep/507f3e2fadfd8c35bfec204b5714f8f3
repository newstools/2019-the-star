He said: "We have been watching China to see why they are so successful. We knew we were playing the defending champions. There is a big difference in class between us and China and we were not expecting to win. We worked hard and wanted to get past 10 points in each set. We had some success on attacks and learned a lot." Kenya captain Mercy Moim conceded defeat, saying they played well but it was not good enough. “We gave our best but they were stronger. I think playing China will make us better going forward," noted Moim.
