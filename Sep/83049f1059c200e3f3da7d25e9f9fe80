Kenyan Premier League side KCB and Protege Football Club have entered into a long-term partnership that will see the latter become the bankers’ official youth team. The partnership was unveiled at the end of a trials exercise conducted at the KCB Leadership Center, attracting over 100 youngsters from across the country. 36 players were successful at the trials and thus recruited into the academy, joining up with a number of youngsters who already call PFC their home. “The selected players will be integrated into the system and not only benefit from a program that takes their talents to the next level but also improves on their mental, physical and social strengths,” said PFC Director Steve Othoro. “Since 2008, we have had over 80 players who have played for their national teams, five making appearances at the Fifa World Cup. It is this level of success that we envisage for the players we are working with.” A number of KCB coaches were part of the selection process and the club is upbeat that PFC will continue to churn top players who can be absorbed into the senior team. “We are extremely excited to work with PFC who have already shown they have the personnel and skills set to develop players from such tender ages,” said KCB Team Manager Bramwell Mbirira. “Working with them ensures that while we concentrate on getting the best out of the senior team, there’s a clear path for youngsters developed through our youth system to take the step up,” he added. The move is also in line with Football Kenya Federation (FKF) club licensing rules which requires topflight clubs to invest in and have fully-functional youth structures. Protégé have youth set-ups of between seven and 21 years. The U19 team currently play in the FKF County League. Two of PFC’s players Eric Kinuthia and Ronald Bebeto, are with the national U20 team for the Cecafa Championship set for Uganda between September 21 and October 5.
