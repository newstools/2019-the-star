KCB won the National sevens circuit after beating Impala 26-21 in the Driftwood Sevens tournaments in Mombasa. This was their fourth win of the circuit after emerging top in Kakamega, Dala and Christie Sevens. The bankers came from 14-0 down at the breather to win the crown in front of a partisan crowd at the Mombasa Sports Club. Impala were quick off the blocks and took the lead through Jeremy Griffin with Mark Kwemoi converting for a 7-0 lead. Things went from bad to worse for the bankers with playmaker Johnstone Olindi sent to the bin for cynical play. Kwemoi then showed the KCB defence clean pair of heels to touch down and converted his try for a 14-0 lead at the interval. The bankers came out firing on all cylinders in the second half with Geoffrey Okwatch, beating two defenders before substitute Shaban Ahmed scored a centre post try.  Ahmed kicked over the conversion to trail 7-14-7. Dennis Mwanja's charges then levelled up matters seconds later when Okwtach created the try for Vincent Onyala, who dived over the whitewash. Ahmed slotted the extra two points to tie the match at 14-14. Levy Amunga pounced on a kick to score the third try but Impala hit back quickly through Alvin Marube while Kwemoi tied the scored again. Ahmed ensured a win for KCB after he dived over after being set up by Isaac Njoroge. Daystar won the Division Two after a 15-12  win over Catholic Monks.
