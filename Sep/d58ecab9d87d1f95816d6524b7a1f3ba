Suicide has been on a worrying trend among teenagers and other citizens. Depression and lack of counselling support are among the major causes of suicide. Parents should be observant of their children and also encourage them to be open with them to create a good relationship. Remarks such as ‘I wish I was never born’ or ‘ no one cares for me’ can indicate suicidal thoughts. The government should innovate counselling departments that will cover the welfare of teenagers. The church should offer an ear to those depressed and offer guidance and hope.  Mombasa
