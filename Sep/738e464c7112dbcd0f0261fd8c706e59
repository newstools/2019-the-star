A mother and her child are feared dead after their car veered off from a ferry and plugged into the Indian Ocean on Sunday evening. Likoni OCPD Benjamin Rotich said that the vehicle lost breaks and reversed just before the ferry docked. The car, a Toyota ISIS registration number KCB 289C was onboard MV Harambee and was plying to the Island side. The ferry is one of the oldest and has its ramps broken down and hanging into the water. "They might be dead because the incidence happened an hour ago and its deep sea," Rotich said. He said that ferry officials attempted to throw out rescue savers near the car, but the two were trapped inside the car and could not access them. "We want to advise commuters to adhere to directives being given by the security officials at the ferry," Rotich added. The car and the occupants are yet to be retrieved as rescue operation which was being carried out by the Marine Police, Kenya Ferry Services, Kenya Red Cross and members of the public was called off due to darkness. In a post on its Facebook account, Kenya Ferry Services said: “The cause of the accident is still under investigations as search and rescue efforts are underway…we share our sincere sympathies to the affected as the salvage operations continue.” In July this year, a driver and his turn-boy escaped unhurt as their canter plugged into the Indian Ocean after having a complication during disembarking.
