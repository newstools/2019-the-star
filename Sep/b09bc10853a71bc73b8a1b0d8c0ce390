The number of car theft suspects in police custody in Nairobi has risen to five after two were arrested in Kariobangi South on Tuesday. Three others were seized in Kasarani on Saturday. “We have this evening arrested two motor vehicle theft suspects after raiding a godown in  Kariobangi South. Car parts, including engines, doors and number plates were recovered,” Kasarani subcounty police commander Peter Kimani said. Kimani said the suspects arrested on Saturday (Francis Kinyanjui, Gladys Wanjiku and Stephen Njoroge) disclosed to the police where the godown with stolen cars was located. The suspects committed their crimes in Kasarani, Roysambu and Thika. Police say that the stolen vehicles are dismantled for spare parts. “They have been stealing three to four vehicles monthly. They dismantle and sell them as spare parts,” Kimani said. Kimani said it was not the first time that the five were arrested. “They are wanted in Thika, Kilimani, Kamukunji and Kajiado where they had been arrested, taken to court and released on bail. They later escaped,” he said. The police will raid all spare parts shops in Kasarani and inspect the spares. "Everyone will have to account for his spares,” Kimani said. He asked vehicle owners to always buy genuine parts with labels and deny the thieves market.
