Distressed Kenyan national 5,000m champion Daniel Simiyu has revealed he is contemplating quitting the track and venturing into road racing full time. Simiyu is still hurt with the decision by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to bar him from running in the IAAF World championships started yesterday in Doha for a mistake he believes is not of his own making. He disclosed that he is in consultation with his management over his intended switch and will give his position soon. “I’m still talking with my management because I want to quit track and concentrate on road running. I was supposed to be in Doha at the moment with others but I am here. I was so confident of reclaiming the 5,000m title for Kenya but it’s not possible now. It is so sad,” regretted Simiyu, who hails from Elgeyo Marakwet County. Despite last-minute intervention by AK to have Michael Kibet and Simiyu cleared,  Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) stuck to their guns, barring them from the 2019 worlds. The frustrations notwithstanding Simiyu yesterday went on to win the Safaricom Kisii 10km road race in a time of 29:16.71. The Kenyan 5,000m champion was in a class of his own, taking charge of the race after 5km and never looked back. Shadrack Kemboi, who crossed the finish line in 29:22.82, was second with Leonard Langat third in 29:40.96. Brilliant Jepkorir also from Elgeyo Marakwet County won the women’s race in 33:39.61, beating Nancy Jeplagat to the second position in 34:41.15 while the third place went to Jacqueline Rotich in 34:38.97. Winners of both events pocketed Sh100,000 each with second and third-placed athletes getting Sh40,000 and Sh30,000 respectively. The race was reduced from half marathon to meet AK’s Road Running requirements on prize money. Josel Moturi of St Peter’s Keberesi secondary was the top local runner in 10th place. He received Sh10, 000 while in the women’s category, the first local runner was Lorna Nyabochoa who was 11th. Veteran road racer Declerk Omari was the masters category winner and was followed by Justine Mogire and Daniel Ng’eno. In the women’s category, Nancy Kimaiyo won the race beating veteran marathoner Jackline Nyangeri to second place while Maureen Ongoro was third. More than 20 Olympians and retired athletes led by Charles Asati and Ezekiel Nyamao graced the event. Safaricom’s senior manager retail operations in the greater Western region Edwin Sang flagged off the race.
