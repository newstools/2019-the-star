The Kenya Magistrates and Judges Association have moved to court seeking to stop one of their own from taking plea over the loss of heroin valued at Sh30 million. KMJA says they are concerned about the threats to liberty of one its members -junior principal magistrate Edgar Kagoni - who is a judicial officer serving in the capacity of Principal Magistrate in Mombasa Law courts. KagoniÂ is expected to be presented before JKIA law courts this morning to take plea. Mombasa chief magistrate Evans Makori was the whistle-blower in the disappearance of Sh30 million heroin at the Mombasa Court. The missing narcotics led to the arrest of Kagoni on Saturday. Makori wrote to regional DCI boss Washington Njiiru on August 8 to request investigations into the exhibit that was reported missing from the exhibit store on July 26. In the letter, Makori said the exhibits of the criminal case no 468 0f 2018 Republic verses Hussein Massoud Eid and two others went missing between June 28 and July 26. The criminal case in which Eid was being charged with possession of the narcotics was presided over by Kagoni. Njiiru then wrote to his bosses in Nairobi on August 13, acknowledging receipt of the complaint from Makori. After weeks of investigations, DCI agents arrested Kagoni, who was apparently taken by surprise and booked him at Kilindini police station. Also arrested was Abdalla Awadh Abubakar, an executive assistant at the Mombasa Law Courts, who is held at Makupa Police Station; Lawrence Thoya Bayan, support staffer at the court booked at Nyali police station, and Onesmus Miinda Momanyi, a court assistant at Ruiru law courts.
