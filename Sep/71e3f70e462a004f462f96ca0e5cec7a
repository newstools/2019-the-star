The government has ordered the closure of Precious Talent Academy after the Monday tragedy that left eight dead. The owner of the school, Moses Wainaina, has also been arrested to be arraigned in court on Friday. Through Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha, the government said the closure follows recommendations by a task force that was set up to look into the safety of the pupils after the tragedy. Magoha said as a result, more than 923 pupils who had been enrolled at the school will be relocated to neighbouring schools. The CS said the school was registered to admit only 340 learners but violated these guidelines. He said at the time of collapse, the school had 800 learners. "The high enrollment and lack of safe physical facilities with non-compliance of qualified teaching staff, sanitation facilities thus render the registration facility null and void," Magoha said on Thursday. "This condition did not warrant existence of the school and is thus recommended for revocation of certificate and closure." Magoha also ordered the closure of another school, brining to three the schools which have been closed since Monday. St Catherine Christian Educational Centre in Kibera was shut on Wednesday and Palm Academy in Kangemi on Thursday. "We have closed down Palm Academy. It's structure is exactly the same as the one that collapsed in Dagoretti. If you look on the inside, the timber supporting the storey has began rotting," Magoha said. CS Magoha also said criminal investigations are ongoing.
