Deputy President William Ruto helped raise about Sh10 million for churches in Uasin Gishu, Vihiga and West Pokot over the weekend. In Eldoret, the DP helped to raise about Sh10 million for nine churches in Kapseret constituency where he gave a personal donation of Sh3 million. MP Oscar Sudi donated Sh2 million. The DP had earlier helped raise money for Sekerr Catholic Church in West Pokot where he gave Sh2 million. At Kapseret, the DP said he would continue to work with churches because he believes in God. “I am happy to be associated with churches and that is why I ensure that I come so that we raise money for the work of God,” the DP said in Eldoret. He was accompanied by MPs Caleb Kostany, Didmus Barasa, Daniel Rono and John Waluke and former Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale. Ruto avoided politics at the Eldoret function where he largely dwelt on government plans to improve roads, water, agriculture and education. However, his allies vowed to continue supporting his quest for the presidency in 2022. The MPs from Western led by Waluke and Barasa said the Luhya community had decided to back Ruto for the top seat. “The Mulembe nation has decided that we will support Ruto in 2022. Only Khalwale was stubborn but he has been treated by Ruto and he is now with us,” Waluke said. He said all churches had blessed Ruto to be the next president and nothing would stand in his way come 2022. The Ruto allies told off CAS Rachael Shebesh for undermining Jubilee candidate for Kibra Macdonald Mariga. Edited by R.Wamochie
