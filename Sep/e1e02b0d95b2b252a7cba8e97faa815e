Manchester United are close to agreeing a new deal with goalkeeper David de Gea that will see him earn wage parity with Paul Pogba, according to The Guardian. The 28-year-old Spaniard’s current deal is set to expire at the end of the current season, with several clubs interested in his services. However, the new proposal will see De Gea earn £290,000 a week to reach parity with the club’s record signing Paul Pogba. De Gea joined the Old Trafford club in 2011 and has made 366 appearances, winning the Premier League in 2013, plus one FA Cup, one League Cup and one Europa League title. One of boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s main tasks was to secure the futures of key players within the squad. Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford are among those to recently pen new deals, and the club hierarchy believe De Gea will be the next to sign. The deal would also restore the market value of a player who was entering the final nine months of his existing deal and ensure he cannot leave for free. De Gea had previously attracted strong interest from Real Madrid, but their signing of Thibaut Courtois last summer has ended hopes of him joining the rivals of boyhood club Atletico Madrid.
