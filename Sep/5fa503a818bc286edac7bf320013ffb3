Nine fully-equipped maternal health facilities have been commissioned in Kaloleni and Rabai subcounties, Kilifi, to benefit 130,000 mothers and their children. The health project is a collaboration of the county government, the Canadian government and the Aga Khan Foundation and it is expected to boost maternal health services and reduce the mortality rate of mothers and children. County Health CEC Omar Anisa identified some of the facilities as Vishakani, Mgamboni, Mariakani, Mnarani, Gombeni and Rabai. Anisa, who spoke during the commissioning on Thursday, said the facilities have furnished and equipped maternal and child health units. "Community health care workers were also trained on basic emergency care where they can act and refer emergency cases to a level four facility nearby," she said. Mariakani Hospital has e-learning with video link to Aga Khan Hospital in Mombasa. Doctors can share and exchange notes through video links when handling critical cases. Anisa commended the Aga Khan Foundation and the Canadian government for their assistance in the reduction of infant and maternal mortality. ‘‘The main goal of the programme is to improve health systems and strengthen health outcomes of children and expectant mothers." She the target of the Access to Quality Care through Extending and Strengthening Health Systems (AQCESS) is to improve health systems in the county that has been lacking vital structures and equipment. Dr Marleen Temmerman of the Aga Khan University said a similar project is being implemented in Kisii. The two projects have cost C$7.5 million (Canadian dollars). "There are challenges in accessing quality health care services with limited facilities but through collaboration with the county government, we shall be able to bridge the gap," Temmerman said. Vishakani Community health volunteer Irene Anchari said the AQCESS project has been a major milestone in saving the lives of mothers and children. Edited by R.Wamochie
