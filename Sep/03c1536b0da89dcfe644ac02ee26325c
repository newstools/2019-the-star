Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko's daughter Saumu might be engaged to her politician lover, Lamu Senator Anwar Loitiptip. Saumu hinted at 'good news' in a social media post. She wrote, "Davido had the longest jumpy period of his life …shot videos with the most beautiful women alive .but look at him now …Every woman would want to be Chioma right now. That kind of love exists and it takes a lot more than just looks and sex. This current life is here to prepare us for the next life ..and what matters most is for us to love and to be loved." Adding, "So if you have anything to say to me, say it now, enjoy your two minutes of fame or be quiet forever. I don’t want to be the first one to break the good news. I will leave it to my MR… You will forever be my Best friend."
