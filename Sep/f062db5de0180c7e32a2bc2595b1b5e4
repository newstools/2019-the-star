The matatu driver caught on camera on Tuesday message-texting as he cruised at 100KPH will be retested for competence. The National Transport and Safety Authority,  on its social media platforms, said that other than suspending Samuel Maina's driving licence, his PSV licence had been revoked. The driver's badge was withdrawn and 2NK Sacco ordered to remove him from its portal. The sacco was also ordered to organise road safety sensitisation for its management, drivers and conductors within seven days. The officials and the driver had been summoned by a multi-agency team comprising of NTSA and the National Police Service officials. “The action of this driver put the lives of many innocent passengers at risk. The use of mobile phones is a distraction. It takes the driver’s eyes off the road,” a post on NTSA Facebook page read. Maina was driving the PSV registration number KCK 008M from Karatina to Nairobi. The posts by the passengers claim that he was driving at 100KPH and at the same time texting. 2NK Sacco chairman James Kahiro told reporters they suspended Maina after seeing his photo on social media.
