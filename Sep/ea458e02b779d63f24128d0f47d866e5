There is light at the end of the tunnel for the counties after Senators on Thursday dropped their hard-stance on county funds. The Senators agreed to the Sh316.5 billion allocation as proposed by the National Assembly. The move will now end the three-month standoff that had plunged the counties into a cash crisis. Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen, reading a press statement on behalf of the Senate, said the legislators softened their stance because of the pain and suffering in the counties. "The country is faced with the real prospect of shutting down services at the counties. This would have a disastrous effect on the critical sectors such as agriculture and health," Murkomen said. The Senators sharply clashed with the Members of the National Assembly over the amount that should be allocated to the devolved units in the Division of Revenue Bill, 2019. While MPs insisted on Sh316billion, Senators had maintained that the counties should be allocated Sh335 billion.
