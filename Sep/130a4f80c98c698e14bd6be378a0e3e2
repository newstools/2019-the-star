An MP and residents of residents of Witemere slum in Nyeri have opposed the transfer a dumpsite to the area. Moving the Asian Quarters dumpsite will increase insecurity and pollute Chania River, Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu and the slum residents said yesterday. Nyeri town has been without a dumpsite after the county government began building a Sh600 million bus terminus at Asian Quarters where the garbage dump was located in June. The area, which was years ago used as a sewage disposal site, is also near peoples' homes. Resident Peter Maina said the dumpsite is near King’ong’o GK Prison and a mosque. “We fear that if the dumpsite is moved it will pollute Chania River where we draw water,” they said. Another resident Agnes Wacheke said the county government did not conduct public participation before making a decision on the relocation of the dumpsite. “The county government should have called a public meetings and inform us of their intentions to move the dumpsite here. How will they manage the garbage?" They said the county government has begun building a road to be used by garbage trucks without consulting them. MP Wambugu weighed in on the debate and said public participation must be done first. “We agreed that this cannot proceed without public participation by the local community. We will get an injunction if need be until the public is fully involved,” Wambugu said. Environment executive Fredrick Kinyua said the place is better placed for the dumpsite. He said the county government was planning to setup a solid waste management plant so as to manage and recycle the garbage. Political leaders and residents from other constituencies in Nyeri also opposed a dumpsite being set up in their respective areas.
