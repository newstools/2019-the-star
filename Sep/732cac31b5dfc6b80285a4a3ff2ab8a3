No stone will be left unturned as the Kenya Volleyball Federation seeks to find out who was behind Edith Wisa’s passport disappearance prior to the team’s participation in Intercontinental Olympic Qualifiers in Italy last month, says secretary-general Ben Juma. Wisa's passport went missing from her back during a training session at the Moi Stadium Indoor Arena, Kasarani on the day the team was meant to go for visa application at the Italian Embassy, only for the document to reappear days after the player had applied for the new one. The development saw Wisa, who turns up for the national league champions Kenya Prisons, miss the four-nation tournament that saw Malkia strikers finish winless against hosts Italy, Belgium and Netherland. The team will now seek to book the sole slot for the Tokyo 2020 bonanza during next year’s continental qualifiers. Juma said the development was unfortunate and the culprits must be brought to book so that there will be no repeat. “If someone can think of taking a passport of a player what else can he or she do in the incoming events? asked Juma, a former volleyball player. He continued: “At this rate, this can even extend to killing someone and that’s why we are keen on unravelling the culprits. We will exhaust every mechanism to bring to books the individuals involved.” Juma at the same time heaped praise on the national team players and the technical bench at large for retaining the All Africa Games title on Friday following a 3-1 win against their newfound rivals Cameroon. “The team did well and more so the young players who were given a chance and they rose up to the occasion. They can only get better,” noted the official.
