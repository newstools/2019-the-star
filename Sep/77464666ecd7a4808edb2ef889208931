The race to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta has been taking steady shape with a host of individuals making pronouncements of interest. Governors serving their second terms are taking the stage to run in the presidential election but many will, of course, be winnowed as the election draws closer. The one governor who seems determined to go all the way to the ballot is Machakos’ Alfred Mutua. Over the last six years, Governor Mutua has distinguished himself as a pragmatic advocate of the poor people, setting up pro-poor initiatives that help in poverty reduction and wealth generation. That journey, however, has not been all rosy. He has encountered political meddling mainly from the executives of Wiper party. He comes from a backyard that was traditionally loyal to former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka, whom Mutua broke ranks with, exiting Wiper to start his own Maendeleo Chap Chap. Mutua has won in Machakos by fixing what was broken; building market shades in the 40 sub-locations, lighting up streets and tiny villages, enlarging the infrastructure by building roads and drilling boreholes. He is well regarded for those initiatives as well as the free advanced ambulance service across the county. Now he is on the verge of constructing his legacy-building project: Machakos New City, which will be funded by the county and foreign investors. Being a young governor, Mutua personifies Kenya’s changing political nature. He understands the predicament of the poor rural people. He must use that pragmatism to transform human life and fervently fight against corruption as evidence to seek the top national seat. He must broaden his appeal beyond his native Ukambani stronghold to establish himself first.  Media and communications strategist
