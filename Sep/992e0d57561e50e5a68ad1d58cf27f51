A G4S employee linked to the Sh72 million Nairobi West heist was arrested on Monday evening and Sh1 million was recovered buried in a cow shed in Lurambi, Kakamega county. The suspect, Bernard Sewanga, had gone into hiding. He was arrested in a newly rented house in Ruiru and he then led detectives to Lurambi, where he had buried cash in his father-in-law's homestead. The cash was found hidden in a black bag and buried in the cow shed. The DCI wrote in a tweet, "One million shillings which is believed to be part of Ksh72M stolen from Nairobi West has been recovered from a cow shade in #Lurambi by @DCI_Kenya Detectives working on intelligence. One suspect; Bernard Sewanga, an employee of G4S, who had gone into hiding, was also arrested." County commander Bernard Muli said detectives were conducting further investigations. Earlier in the day, a 60-year-old granny was among two suspects arrested in Kalumoni, Machakos county over the heist. According to the DCI, the two were arrested by sleuths from the DCI's Special Crime Prevention Unit before Sh2.3 million was recovered from them. The money recovered was in denominations of Sh1,000 new Kenyan currency notes. The DCI said one of the suspects John Kamau Mulei is a brother to Bernard Mwendwa, a G4S officer who was arrested after the heist. “Upon his arrest at Muumandu village in Machakos, Kamau led the detectives to his grandmother (second suspect) 60-year-old Mary Kyalo in whose house the Money was recovered,” read a tweet by the DCI.
