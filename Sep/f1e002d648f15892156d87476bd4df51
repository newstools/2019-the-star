Arsene Wenger is ‘on the verge of taking a job at Fifa as the former Arsenal boss prepares his return to football. The 69-year-old Frenchman has been out of football since bringing to an end his 21-year association with Arsenal in May 2018. Wenger has kept busy with punditry but Goal reports that Wenger is now close to accepting a new technical role to work with football’s governing body. While the role would be new at Fifa, the report details that Wenger would be set to take up a lot of the work done by the departed Zvonimir Boban. Boban left his position as Deputy Secretary-General at Fifa in May to become the new Chief Football Officer at AC Milan. But Wenger’s wealth of experience is also seen as a valuable asset to Fifa with Goal adding that the governing body is ‘keen to tap into his vast array of coaching expertise’ to continue developing players and future managers. Wenger had previously talked up his return to football while as a pundit on beIN Sports, where he intimated that he plans to be at the World Cup in 2022. ‘I could see myself working for a team,” he said. “I will have enough time and distance with my last job (to give me perspective), and I would not be against that. “I must say I always wanted to go to the World Cup because I felt it is the job of a manager to be where the best football players in the world play football. “Hopefully, you will see me, touch wood, in Qatar in three years’ time.”
