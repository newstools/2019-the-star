Theatre equipment worth Sh500,000 that is used for brain surgery at the Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital has been stolen. The theft of the equipment used at the ICU unit was reported at the Embu police station on Monday. “It’s true there was equipment which the hospital authority reported to have been stolen. It cost an estimated Sh0.5 million," county police commander Daniel Rukunga told the Star on the phone Tuesday. The police boss said the theft is suspected to have been an inside job. "Various employees at the hospital have recorded statements with the subcounty Directorate of Criminal Investigations." Rukunga said it was still early to tell who the culprits are but police had launched investigations. Sources told the Star the theft was discovered last week before the matter was reported to the police. The equipment is key in conducting brain surgeries at the hospital, one of Governor Martin Wambora's legacy projects. Wambora previously said more than 300 brain surgeries have been performed at the hospital since the sophisticated machines were installed two years ago. Among those treated are boda boda riders who sustained brain injuries following accidents. Most riders operate without helmets. In July, county secretary Johnson Nyaga said the hospital had become a neuro-surgery hub in Mt Kenya region after hiring of a new CEO to oversee operations. "These surgeries have saved many lives, including those of boda boda accident victims some of who broke their skulls and had blood entering their brains," Nyaga said. He was speaking at Izaak Walton Inn when the represented Wambora during a dinner to mark one year since the Embu County’s Professionals and Development Association was formed.
