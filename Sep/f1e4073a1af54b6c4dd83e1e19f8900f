Busia County Pending Bills committee has been inaugurated with a specific task of verifying bills that were not passed by the Office of the Auditor General last year. Addressing journalists after the inauguration, acting Finance executive Phaustine Barasa said the committee was appointed in pursuance of a circular from the Controller of Budgets dated June 4. She said the ad hoc committee has been given 30 days to vouch for the documents of the bills that were not honoured, visit the sites to ascertain the existence of the said projects and submit their report. Barasa said Philip Musumba who was outsourced as per the terms of reference is the chairman of the committee. Other members of the committee include Zadock Koech from Internal Audit Department, Edward Okoth (Finance), Sharon Ndakalu (Procurement) and Paul Atelu (Roads, Public works, Transport and Energy). Musumba said they have started looking into why the bills remained pending, whether they were procured well and whether they are payable. “We shall deliver a credible report within the prescribed time,” he said. He thanked the county government for "according him an opportunity of serving in the committee as an independent nominee". Edited by R.Wamochie
