ODM leader Raila Odinga has asked the Ministry of Education to strengthen university curricula to address the graduates' skills and labour market mismatch. Raila said there was a crisis of universities producing graduates with skills employers are not seeking, resulting in joblessness among the youth. He spoke in Ugunja during the launch of Ugunja Vocational and Training College. The Africa Union High Representative of Infrastructure Development said being an engineer, he appreciated the role of vocational colleges in the economy. Raila cautioned Kenyans not to believe that it's only university degrees that can guarantee jobs. He said many youths with excellent academic papers were graduating into joblessness. "Despite all the graduates in the country most of the employers still insist that they cannot find the skills in them," Raila said. Raila said those who do not make it to the university must be enrolled in vocational colleges to fit in the job market. He, however, clarified that the situation does not mean the country does not need university degrees but that there is a need for curricula review. “The universities have no option but to ensure that they work closely with the employers with the focus on skills and not just learning,” Raila said. Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi who hosted the event said the institution will go a long way in improving the county labour market. Wandayi reminded residents that education is the key to complete development in any country. The MP asked local leaders to divorce politics from development if they want the region to develop. Wandayi said with the prevailing tranquillity occasioned by the historic handshake Nyanza leaders have no option but to develop their areas. (edited by O. Owino)
