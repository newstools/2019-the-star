Immediately after they were released by Narok police officers unconditionally, Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ngeno, Ilmotiok MCA Samuel Kositany and his Ololulung’a counterpart Jafferson Langat vowed to continue fighting for the rights of the Mau people after they were released unconditionally by Narok police. They turned their guns on Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko and Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya and told them  to declare their interests on Mau issues. They were arrested on Tuesday and released in the evening after each paid a police bail of Sh150, 000. On Wednesday evening police preferred no charges against them. They were accused of incitement, illegal assembly and obstruction. They were accompanied by Bureti MP Japhet Mutai and Kipsigis MCAs. Ngeno wondered why CS Tobiko is now claiming the title deeds are illegal and yet he was a lawyer to Nkaroni group ranch that is within Mau region before he was appointed to the position of Director of Public Prosecutions. “During that time, Tobiko petitioned the then Narok County Council for a no objection so that that particular parcel of land sheet five be declared an adjudication section so that the members of that group ranch can be issued with title deeds. Today, Tobiko wants to tell us he doesn’t know, he is not aware or unless he has lost his mind,” Ngeno said.
