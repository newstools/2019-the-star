Former Buuri MP Kinoti Gatobu says he at one time swallowed poison to commit suicide after he was suspended because of breaking a windowpane. He was in high school then and was afraid of facing his parent. "I was too afraid to go home so I bought Rat Rat, a poison used to kill rats, but miraculously I did not die," he said in Meru county on Sunday. He spoke to motivate hundreds of youth at Kamunde Hall, North Imenti, in the Tubonge forum, where the youths were mentored on how they can uplift their livelihoods using education, talent and entrepreneurship. Gatobu said suicide should be the last resolve to the youth, despite the challenges. He said despite coming from a poor background, he had resolved to excel by working hard in school, but peer pressure led him to vices.
