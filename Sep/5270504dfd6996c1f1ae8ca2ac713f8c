Fishermen are concerned about the dwindling stock of common carp, the dominant fish species in Lake Naivasha. The drop has been attributed to overfishing and use of undersize nets. Fishermen complain that "the lake is open for everyone to scramble for fish". In the last couple of months, there has been an insurgence of youths from the neighbouring informal settlements who engage in illegal fishing Chairman of Friends of Lake Naivasha Francis Muthui said there are fears that the common carp will go the same way as the black bass species. Muthui said the acute shortage of common carp started being felt early this year. At that time, it was attributed to the cold season. “Currently, getting common carp in the lake is like a miracle. We fear its facing extinction just like the black bass which is no longer available in the lake,” he said. Muthui said that although the fish is not popular among consumers, it is affordable to many families because it is cheap. "All energy has been concentrated on saving tilapia while common carp has dropped to around five per cent mainly due illegal fishing,” he said. Lake Naivasha Boat Owners Association chairman David Kilo supported him. He said it has become difficult to catch common carp. KIlo said there has been an increase in the number of people fishing on the shores of the lake using undersize nets. “Though common carp was an invasive species, it boasted fish catch in the lake but sadly due to overfishing it’s a matter of time before it becomes extinct,” he said. County director of fisheries Mathew Ngila said that they had engaged researchers from KEFRI to investigate the sharp drop in the fish. He admitted that there is illegal fishing. Ngila said the county government will work with fishermen to restock. “At times fish catch drops depending on one season to the other but we have engaged our researchers to that they can get to the bottom of this and advice us on the way forward,” he said.
