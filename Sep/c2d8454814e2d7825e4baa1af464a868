Renowned mixmaster DJ Tadgue has defended colleague DJ Kriss Darlin, who received a massive backlash for kneeling in front of his party leader Raila Odinga. Speaking exclusively to Word Is, the king of mashups said the backlash was sparked by the fact that Kriss is a DJ and because society thinks very low of them. “If it was an MCA or a party member who had knelt it wouldn’t even have made the news, he has been trending because he is a DJ,” he said. “How many stunts have politicians pulled and today they are in office. It s high time people realise that DJs can lead too. We are always viewed as failures and I hope Kriss Darlin can prove everyone wrong.” DJ Tadgue said it takes a lot of research, skill, talent and hard work to move the masses with music. He holds that if Kriss uses the skills he has learned as a DJ to campaign his opponents will not stand a chance. “Some of the biggest companies in this country are led by former DJs. It’s a career like any other,” he added. Kriss Darlin’s contract was terminated by his former employers after he declared interest in running for political office. According to the head of production and programming at NTV, Julius Tharao, the Dohty Family founder violates editorial policy by actively participating in politics.
