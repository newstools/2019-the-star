A section of Pokot leaders from Tiaty, Baringo county has appealed to the government to arrest and prosecute bandits operating in the region. Led by Churo-Amaya ward rep Ameja Zelemoi they said banditry and cattle rustling menace are embarrassing the community and blocking development activities. “Besides pursuing the stolen animals, security officers should also arrest the bandits and have them arraigned,” Zelemoi said. Zelemoi spoke during a homecoming party for Baringo deputy governor Jacob Chepkwony at Seretunin in Baringo central subcounty on Saturday. The MCA said Tiaty subcounty had lagged behind in the provision of education, water, food and infrastructure due to insecurity. “We are saying enough is enough. The government should step in and arrest the few criminals among us,” Zelemoi said. He was backed by Silale ward MCA Nelson Lotela, Maria Losile (Loyamorok), Daniel Tuwit (Ripko) and Solomon Makal (Kolowa). The leaders condemned an attack by suspected Pokot bandits in which a herder was shot dead at Ruggus in Baringo South subcounty last Sunday. Lotela, however, urged Pokots to stop attacking and raiding the neighbouring communities and instead coexist with them in peace. “Please respect and listen to what we, your leaders whom you elected are telling you. Stop killing your neighbours,” Lotela said. He further asked the Rift Valley regional commissioner Gorge Natembeya to visit the area and deploy more security officers to strengthen security in the county. Speaking during a function at Riongo in his constituency last week, Tiaty MP William Kamket urged the government to move faster and deal with the bandits. “Majority of our people in Pokot are peaceful except a few criminals, who should be pursued and dealt with firmly by the law,” Kamket said.
