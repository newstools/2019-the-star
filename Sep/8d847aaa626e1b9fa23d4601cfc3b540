A woman accused of killing her husband by chopping off his genitals was on Tuesday charged with murder before a Nakuru court. The court said a mental assessment report from the Nakuru Level 5 Hospital indicated Naomi Nyokabi was fit to stand trial. “The report from psychiatrist indicated that the accused person is of sound mind and she can stand trial,” Nakuru High Court judge Joel Ngugi said. Nyokabi pleaded not guilty. She is alleged to have chopped off the genitals of her 52-year-old husband who later died while undergoing treatment at the Nakuru Level 5 Hospital. It is believed he died due to excessive bleeding from the genitalia. A post mortem report showed the man suffered injuries on some parts of his body including his head and face. The legs were swollen with a section of the genitalia cut. Police said that the attack happened after the suspect accused her husband of not providing for the family. According to police, Nyokabi attacked her husband with a club, before picking a kitchen knife and chopping off his manhood. She was later rescued by police from an angry mob that wanted to lynch her. The case will be mentioned on Wednesday when a ruling on bond terms will also be made.
