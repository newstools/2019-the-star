The Koitalel Samoei University College has admitted its first batch of students in what Nandi Governor Stephen Sang called a milestone. The constituent college of the University of Nairobi admitted 100 students to pursue Commerce and Education degrees. The constituent college, which replaced the relocated Mosoriot Teachers' College, will be officially opened tomorrow, on Friday. “It will open up many other opportunities for our region,” Sang told the Star on Wednesday. Acting principal Prof Gideon Misoi said the University of Nairobi had dispatched directors of the schools of Business and Education alongside the academics registrar. “All systems are set to begin classes next week and all first students will choose whether they want to be accommodated; either within the college or outside,” Misoi said. The university has taken over all facilities formally used by the more than 600 students of MTC. §more than 100 privately sponsored students have applied to join Koitalel University College, the principal said. The main campus is under construction at Nandi Hills town. President Uhuru Kenyatta laid the foundation stone in the run-up to the 2017 general elections. “Work is going on well at Nandi Hills where we plan to have the main campus and administrative centre,” Misoi said. The university was established in honour of the legendary Nandi leader, Koitalel arap Samoei, who was killed by colonialists and buried in Nandi Hills. Misoi was accompanied by Professors Riechi Rasugu and Japheth Lishanga, the  directors of the schools of  Education, Business and Administration and academics registrars Truphena Estambale and Beatrice Wanjala.
