The Deputy President William Ruto on Thursday hit back at Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru for 'perpetuating tribalism'. Waiguru had on Wednesday said Kenya was not ready for another Kikuyu president, adding that it would fuel the feelings of exclusion from the country's top leadership by other communities. “Let’s be honest, Kenya has many communities and one or two cannot continue dominating the leadership of this country,” Waiguru said. The governor said Kenyans should embrace the Building Bridges Initiative since its proposals are meant to unite the country. Ruto has previously said that BBI is ODM leader Raila Odinga's project. The DP on Thursday said in a tweet that Jubilee supported and voted for President Uhuru Kenyatta to succeed former President Mwai Kibaki not because of ethnicity but competence. "He is not leader of any ethnic community but that of Jubilee, the largest political party with MCA's,MPs and governors in 41 of 47 counties and President of Kenya. Muwache kasumba ya ukabila please (Stop promoting tribalism)," Ruto wrote on Twitter. On Wednesday Waiguru praised Kirinyaga MCAs for rejecting the Punguza Mizigo bill, saying it was not favourable to residents. Punguza Mizigo sponsor and Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot criticised Waiguru for celebrating the rejection, yet the county assembly had not yet debated the bill.
