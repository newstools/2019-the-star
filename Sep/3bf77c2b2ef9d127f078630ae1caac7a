More than 80 students of Senator Kajwang’ Secondary School in Homa Bay suffered losses after their dormitory was razed by fire on Saturday night. No one was injured in the incident at the school situated in Waondo, Suba North constituency. The students lost bedding, books and other personal belongings. Homa Bay county Kenya Red Cross coordinator Samuel Omondi said the fire started when students were undertating their evening studies. “Students couldn’t salvage any of their belongings since the fire had already engulfed the house when they reached the place,” Omondi said. The Red Cross official said students were advised not to go near the fire to avoid any injury. “The fire covered the whole roof and it was dangerous to human life,” he added. County deputy police commander Samuel Obara said investigators were looking for the cause of the fire.
