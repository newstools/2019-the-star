 Mombasa residents will soon be paying Sh30,000 to bury they loved ones in permanent graves, up from Sh25,000, if the 2019/20 Finance Bill is passed. The draft County Finance Bill was subjected to public hearing on Wednesday. Exhumation of bodies will cost Sh30,000, up from the current Sh25,000. Non-permanent graves will cost Sh6,500 and an additional Sh1,500 if the county employees dig the grave. “As a county government, we have staff who work in these cemeteries. They need to be paid and the monies paid for services offered in these sites, go towards their monthly pay,” Finance executive Maryam Mbarak said. Tuk tuk operators registered from November 1, 2018, will also dig deeper in their pockets to pay for monthly stickers. The fees will be Sh2,400, double the current rate of Sh1,200. The operators say the amount is exorbitant. “The monthly sticker charges for tuk tuks have been doubled. This cannot be sustained unless they want to kick us out of business,” one of the operators said during the public participation forum at Tononoka Hall. Tuk tuks registered three years ago will pay Sh1,200 for monthly stickers while those registered four years ago will pay Sh1,800. About 7,000 tuk tuks operate daily in Mombasa. The county government says the tuk tuks cause congestion in the town and there was a need for their regulation. Last year, the administration cancelled the registration of new tuk tuks to curtail their number. However, this was later reversed. Now the county government wants the three-wheel riders regulated through high monthly charges. The multimillion-shilling sector is said to employ about 15,000 youths. Meanwhile, youths who collect garbage to eke a living complained that the Sh3,000 charged for registration of community-based organisations, handcarts of saccos is prohibitive. “Youths are trying to make a living from garbage collection. You are now asking them to pay Sh3,000 to register a handcart. Where will they get the money?” one of them asked. County Environment executive Godfrey Nato said that the Sh3,000 is for established saccos and CBOs. Established companies pay Sh100,000. “We will not disturb youths who have a single handcart. We want to deal with those who have several handcarts, tuk tuks or smaller vehicles, either in CBO or sacco,” Nato said. The County Assembly is expected to debate and pass the Finance Bill before September 30.
