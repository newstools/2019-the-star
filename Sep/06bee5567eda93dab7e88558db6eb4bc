Police officers in Kisii have arrested a watchman and are hunting for another following break-ins in two Mosocho schools. County police commander Martin Kibet said night guard at Ogicha Primary School is in custody after he failed to report the incident. He is being treated as the main suspect over the theft of two computers and a projector from the institution. "He was on duty when the break-in happened," Kibet said. At St Patrick's Primary School in the same area, another two laptops and projector were stolen. The break-in was noted by a daytime security guard. He reported to the headteacher who immediately alerted the police. “The night guard went underground after he noted that the headteacher had reported the matter to the police,” Kibet said. He urged residents to help trace the suspect so he is prosecuted. "We are not going to spare people who abet crime or fail to report incidents like break-ins in schools. The watchman should know that he will not escape from the law,” the police boss said. He urged school managements to do thorough background checks before hiring guards so their property is protected at all costs. All stores must also have still stores, he said. (Edited by F'Orieny)
