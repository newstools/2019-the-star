Politics have taken centre stage on Mau Forest evictions, causing rift and confusion not only among politicians but also to the public. Instead of hurling the settlers out in the cold, the state should convince the over 60,000 families that there is a problem and show them there are alternatives. Politicians and the public should slow down and recognise that we live in a world where everything is connected and whatever we do has repercussions which will influence our future. We owe the future generation a good life and should think about them before the next step. Nairobi
