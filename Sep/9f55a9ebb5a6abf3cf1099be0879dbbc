Few teams have experienced more heartbreak in their quest for promotion to the Kenyan Premier League than Nairobi Stima. However, their veteran midfielder Moses Odhiambo believes the time is nigh for the Ruaraka-based men to make that final step even though the National Super League is still at its infancy. Stima will be at their adopted home of Karuturi in Naivasha to welcome face new boys Fortune Sacco looking to firm their grip on top spot and continue their unbeaten run. “The club has been getting closer and closer to achieve their objective and last season (when they lost the playoffs to Posta Rangers) showed that it's just a matter of time if we continue doing things the right way,” said 39 years old, arguably the oldest player in the league. Aside from their midweek draw against fellow promotion rivals Ushuru, Leonard Odipo’s men have won their other three, plundering a chart-topping performance with 13 goals and conceding just three, a fete that Odhiambo insists must continue. “It's important to find the right balance between attack and defence if you are to compete effectively and I believe we have done that so far. We have to work hard to maintain it throughout a long season,” he added Second-placed Nairobi City Stars who are enjoying a welcome renaissance since the Jonathan Jackson Foundation take-over will be in Mombasa to take on Coast Stima. They have 10 points juts like the team at the top of the NSL table. Bidco, another side that has spent donkey years in the second division in Kenya’s football hierarchy face debutants Murang’a  Seals. Bidco will be looking to put behind them their midweek loss with a victory. Shabana, whose results have made everybody stand up and notice so far, will be in Nairobi to face Administration Police at Camp Toyoyo in the second of a doubleheader fixture at the venue. Prior to this clash, Northern Wanderers, who are yet to register a point on the board, will take on Talanta.
