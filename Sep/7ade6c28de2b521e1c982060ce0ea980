Emotions ran high during the final rites for slain city tycoon Tob Cohen, with his widow, Sarah Wairimu, saying she will 'fight back'. Wairimu said, "Those who killed Tob should stop pretending to be sheep." Cohen's brother Bernard said: "We're here to bury Tob a second time; this time with dignity." Cohen's body was on Tuesday afternoon moved from Chiromo mortuary to the Jewish cemetery on Wangari Maathai Road for the final rites. Some of the prominent personalities in attendance include Dutch ambassador and President Uhuru Kenyatta's cousins, Captain Kung'u Muigai and Ngengi. After speeches were completed, it was only the Jewish procession which was allowed to the graveside. Wairimu was not allowed to proceed. The burial failed to take place on Monday as planned after widow Sarah Wambui’s lead lawyer Philip Murgor said there was lack of quorum of priests because only eight of them instead of 10 showed up at the graveyard which had been prepared. “Tob Cohen's burial has been postponed to tomorrow [today] 2.30pm. Only eight priests out of the required 10 priests and a Rabbi, according to Jewish customs, were present” Murgor said. The Dutch billionaire's body was found last Friday afternoon — eight weeks after his disappearance —in an empty underground water tank at his Kitisuru residence. His body was wrapped in many layers of black plastic. Cohen was reported missing from his Lower Kabete home in Nairobi between July 19 and July 20.
