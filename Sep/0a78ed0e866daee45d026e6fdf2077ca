There seems to be a back and forth in the betting industry after Sportspesa took two weeks before its trading license was renewed. Betting Control and Licensing Board (BCLB)acting director Peter Mbugi told the Star on Thursday that they had not received an application form from Sportpesa. "We haven't received any application. You know what transpired in the courts. We are waiting for them to apply before we follow other procedures in regards to the application," Mbugi told the Star. But Sportpesa head of communications Jean Kiarie said they received a letter from the regulator about the renewal of their license on Wednesday evening. "We only received a letter from BCLB on Wednesday and we applied on Thursday. Why are they saying we haven't applied? Jean posed. "We are still awaiting the confirmation note. But we have made our application following their request for us to do so ..." Jean said. Part of the letter seen by the Star read "In accordance with the gaming act, I  hereby apply for /on behalf of the same partnership for renewal of bookmakers on the course /off the course licenses... "I hereby certify that the particulars submitted in the application for a public gaming license on September 19, 2019 are still correct with the exception of the changes set out..." SportPesa was among 27 betting firms that had their trading licenses revoked by the government due to failure in meeting tax compliance policies two months ago. In early September, the Betting firm was cleared by the Kenya Revenue Authority making it viable to reacquire its license. Once it acquires its license, SportPesa will join 10 other companies which were cleared in July. These include Betway, Mozzart Bet, Odi Bets, Eastleigh Bet, Lucky to you, Ken bookmakers, Bet boss, Kick off, Easi bet and Palms bet.
