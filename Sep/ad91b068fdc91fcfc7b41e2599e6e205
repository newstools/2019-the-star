A Narok High Court has declined to grant temporary orders stopping the Narok county government from implementing a gazette notice giving municipality status to Narok and Kilgoris towns. Narok North MP Moitalel Kenta and 13 others had sought an injunction. Narok resident Judge Justus Bwononga said the petitioners had not shown the harm or danger that would face Narok residents if a temporary injunction is not granted. He ordered a hearing on the main suit on November 11. The suit opposing the elevation of Narok and Kilgoris towns to municipalities names the Narok County government, Governor Samuel Tunai and assembly speaker as respondents. The leaders opposed to the bill passed by the assembly in July this year elevating Narok and Kilgoris town municipalities. They are seeking to de-gazette the higher status. They claim no proper public participation, as required by law, was done as an ad hoc committee was never formed to collect views. Thus, it was wrong for the county government to force the issue "down the throat of Narok residents". In sworn affidavits, they said the higher status will be exploited by the county to increase levies. Kenta told the court that although the bill was well-meaning, the towns do not merit the higher status as their populations do not meet the higher threshold and they lack the necessary infrastructure such as proper water and sewer systems. The respondents denied all the allegations, saying the law was complied with in all respects. They said the new status will attract funding that will improve infrastructure in the two towns
