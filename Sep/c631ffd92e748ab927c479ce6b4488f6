The National Assembly has invited activist Okiya Omtatah to appear before the Departmental Committee on Land by Wednesday. In a letter through the Clerk, the MPs asked Omtatah to present his submissions before the Committee starts vetting the nine National Land Commission nominees on Thursday. The vetting process will run from Thursday to Friday. Omtatah had moved to court to stop the Parliament from vetting the nine nominees to the chair and members to the NLC. Omtatah wants the nine nominations by President Uhuru Kenyatta quashed for not following due process. The activist argued that the selection panel was incompetently constituted by omitting members required to represent stakeholders under Paragraph 1(d) of the First Schedule to the NLC Act, 2012. The President has nominated lawyer Gershom Otachi as the chairperson of NLC to replace Mohammed Swazuri who tenure ended. Those nominated as members are  Esther Murugi Mathenge, James K. Tuitoek, Getrude Nduku Nguku, Reginald Okumu, Hubbie Hussein Al-Haji, Alister Murimi Mutugi and Tiya Galgalo. Otachi will take over from his predecessor Swazuri whose term came to an end in February after a six-year term.
