Senator Samson Cherargei has asked the Office of the Director of Criminal Investigations to stop intimidating him. Cherargei speaking on Thursday while addressing the press from the Parliament said that he is being investigated due to his position as the Chair of Senate Committee on Justice, Legal Affairs and Human Rights. The senator has further questioned the DCI in regards to his arrest and he is yet to be arraigned. "I am surprised that these people have not taken me to court. They just want to intimidate me to write statements, threatening me with the blackmail of arrest," Cherargei said. " We need to stop this political persecution. For heaven's sake, we have a 2010 Constitution which is alive and kicking." The senator was arrested on August 20 by DCI detectives at his home in Uasin Gishu County. He was being probed for allegedly making hate-speech remarks in one of the events. Cherargei was later released on personal bond. His arrest came a day after being summoned by the DCI to record a statement over hate speech remarks.
