Despite losing nearly three-quarters of their dreaded last season squad, Sony Sugar coach James Nandwa is hoping to give the league title a shot and end their 13-year-long trophy drought. The 2006 league winners finished fifth last season with 56 points but dry coffers saw them part ways with their senior and experienced players who sought greener pastures elsewhere. Among the departures was coach Patrick Odhiambo who joined Gor Mahia, forcing the management to hire Nandwa. Other notable exits were skipper Enoch Agwanda who was lured by KCB while their last season top scorer Derick Otanga joined Wazito alongside U-20 midfielder Joshua Nyatini and Kevin Omondi. Tobias Otieno found a new home at Gor. The former Harambee Stars coach, who was last season pegged to relegated National Super League side Kangemi All-Stars, said the massive exodus will not derail the club from a podium finish. “Sony are a big club and my aspiration is to win the league and my players share it as well. When you train the boys you have a target. They have shown high standards and believe in their abilities. We’ve had a small problem at the start but things have moved on well.” He added: “It is a challenge to me as a coach because I came in when we had lost 22 or 23 players but now I have a team. I’ll give my best. I have experience and when you have a new team you have to work harder. I am happy with the way the boys have bought in my idea of football. They are going to perform well if they remain grounded.”
