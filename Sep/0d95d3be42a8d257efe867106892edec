Five Kisumu MCAs have been summoned by the DCI over chaos and assault in the assembly. They are Seth Ochieng (Market Milimani), Seth Okumu (East Seme), Joseph Olale  (Nyalenda B), Ojwang Ogendo  (Nyalenda A) and Joachim Oketch ( Kondele). They are accused of causing chaos and bodily harm to Chief Serjeant-at-arms George Amayo last year. Amayo, a firearm holder, shot in the air in self defence when he was attacked by the MCAs. The MCAs are required to appear before the DCI at Kisumu Central Police Station by noon on Tuesday. County DCI boss Towet Kipkorir confirmed the summons. He said officers are probing the chaos. He noted that immunity and privileges within the assembly are not applicable in criminal cases. "We want to interrogate those involved and then given a comprehensive statement on the next course of action," Towet told the Star on the phone on Monday. Last year, there were gunshots at the Kisumu county assembly after MCAs engaged Amayo in a fight. Amayo - the orderly, shot in the air to scare the MCAs. This was after he called police officers, ostensibly to help him restore peace at the assembly precincts. MCAs shouted at the officers, making them retreat to the sentry box at the assembly entrance. Some members of the public, attracted by the commotion, also attempted to attack the serjeant-at-arms. The latter sought refuge at the security officers' room before he was forced to flee as the MCAs threw stones at him.
