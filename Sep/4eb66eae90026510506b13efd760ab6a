ODM leader Raila Odinga has called on county assemblies where the party enjoys majority status to move with speed and reject the Punguza Mizigo Bill. Raila lauded Siaya County Assembly for being the first assembly to reject the bill which is currently being debated in assemblies across the country. “We laud Siaya for the move, we want other assemblies to help send the same signal across the country that we have rejected the bill,” Odinga said. Raila said ODM-led counties, especially in Nyanza which is his political backyard, should send the message against the bill to others. “I am wondering what Migori is still waiting with the bill, we need to have the bill rejected in Nyanza to send a strong message across the country,” he said. Raila said the Building Bridges Initiative report which is expected to usher in a new referendum push, will tackle government reforms needed through a people participation. Odinga was speaking on Friday at the funeral of Joseph Ogutu Magaka, of St. John Everlasting Gospel Church in West Kanyamkago Ward in Uriri constituency. The funeral was attended by Raila, his wife Ida, governor Obado, senator Ochillo Ayacko, Woman Representative Pamela Odhiambo and Uriri MP Mark Nyamita among others. “We want to warn ODM MCAs who will carry their hand or voice to support the Punguza Mizigo Bill that they will be the first baggage we will offload,” Nyamita warned. He said as a party they are marshalling members to ensure the bill flops, as it has no place in the country. “We have decided as a party that the bill will not see the light of the day, members and elected leaders should toe the line,” Nyamita said. Odhiambo said it was unfortunate that the bill sees women as a burden by abolishing the Woman Representative position. Ayacko said the bill is headed nowhere as its shortcoming will be tackled through the BBI.
