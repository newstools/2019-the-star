Chemists in Meru county have denied allegations that they steal drugs from county health facilities and sell them. They called allegations of theft alarming and unfounded and said the public has been fed falsehoods. Dr Titus Mutura, a medic at a subcounty hospital, said on Wednesday that pharmacists don’t steal patients' drugs. He appealed to residents who come across any medicine bearing the government logo and being sold in private hospitals to report them to the police Upper Eastern Kenya Pharmacists Association chairman Gregory Mwirigi said they have a five-year strategic plan to improve services, accountability and fight quacks. It also aims to improve inspection of medicines sold in pharmacies, ensure their safety and weed out unlicensed chemists. The leaders spoke in Meru town during  World’s Pharmacists' Day themed 'Safe and Effective Medicine for All.' They rejected claims by Meru Deputy Governor Titus Ntuchiu who said the administration has received complaints about drugs administration and distribution and theft from government health facilities. Ntuchiu urged pharmacists to adhere to their professional Code of Conduct to ensure drugs bought by the county don't disappear. “We have been concerned about how drugs are administered or being stolen from health facilities [and taken] to private’s premises. We believe this strategic plan will resolve these issues. We are committed to ensuring there is no shortage in our county facilities," he said. "It is important for this association to crack down on quacks and those caught with stolen drugs so action can be taken against them." He urged the public not to buy drugs from unauthorised dealers as this could cause health problems. Health Executive Misheck Mutuma said pharmacies are being checked to ensure the drugs are genuine, not expired and are recommended by the World Health Organization. (Edited by V. Graham)
