Korir has a personal best of 2:06.51 posted at the 2018 Amsterdam Marathon, where he placed eighth with Lawrence Cherono winning the race in a course record of 2:04.06. The athlete, who trains under Global Sports Communication in Kaptagat alongside world marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge and Kamworor, said he wants to make a difference in his first World Marathon Major event. “This will be my first time to compete in the Berlin Marathon and I want to leave a mark. I am preparing well for the race which will be very competitive as a hope to improve on my time,” said Korir. “With my personal best pegged at 2:06.51, I want to try my best to lower that mark,” he said. He said depending on the weather, he wants to run at least a 2: O4.00. “I may not be famous among Kenyans but I am keen to make a mark in Berlin,” assured Korir who also placed eighth at Hamburg Marathon in April. He said he has gained experience from his first two marathons in road running. He attributed his good training to his mentors Kipchoge and Kamworor.
