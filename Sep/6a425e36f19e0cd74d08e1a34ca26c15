Kirinyaga council of elders has condemned the Wednesday heckling of Governor Anne Waiguru by rowdy youths at a function in Kagumo town. The elders threatened to curse leaders who incite youths to disrupt their political rivals' meetings. Led by chairman Cyrus Githaka, the elders termed the disruption of the event as unfortunate. Githaka said that those who disrupted the meeting should apologise to the county boss. He addressed the press at Riagitugu shrine during the coronation of former Mwea MP Peter Gitau as the council patron. The elder insisted that all elected leaders must be respected by all people irrespective of one's political persuasion. Githaka pointed out that it was in bad faith for the supporters of the Mutira MCA Kinyua Wangui to create chaos during a government function in the area. “We are cautioning the MCAs against the habit of fighting the executive. They should play their oversight role without fighting other elected leaders,” he said Former Mwea MP  Peter Gitao said that elected leaders must be respected. Gitao faulted leaders undermining others in public and said that Kirinyaga residents will elect new leaders according to their performance. “Let's all unite and support each elected leader in their capacity since it is voters who gave them the mandate. We cannot bring about development by causing divisions and wrangling” he said. Chaos erupted on August 11 at Kagumo after rowdy youths demanded that  Mutira ward representative Kinyua Wangui be given a chance to address them. The youths accused the governor of blocking Wangui from speaking during the official opening of a new modern market in Kagumo market. As the youths turned rowdy, armed police cordoned the dais where Waiguru was standing, to counter any possible eventuality. Calm was restored when Wangui was given an opportunity to speak.
