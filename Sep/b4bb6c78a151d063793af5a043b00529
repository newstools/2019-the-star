Kenya and Uganda have signed a peace deal aimed at promoting sustainable peace and development among Turkana, Pokot and Karamojong communities. Signed on Thursday in Uganda, the pact seeks to end the long-running cattle rustling battles. The competition for scarce resources, mainly water and pasture, and the high value placed on cattle has resulted in the culture of raiding, which is often deadly. During the long dry seasons, for instance, herdsmen move their cattle to where there are pasture and water. They often cross forcibly into the territory of neighbouring regions of Teso and Sebei, resulting in deadly conflicts. "This programme is in collaboration with UN will help all of us to ensure that we have peace and that our citizens live together," Uhuru said. The UN-supported intervention that will be led by a ministerial committee co-chaired by Kenya and Uganda will be implemented in the region. It will help reduce tensions resulting from access to shared resources such as water and pasture. Kenyatta said with prevailing peace, development is possible. He said developments will bring all together irrespective of boundaries. The president said peace, development and progress will assist in transforming the region from a conflict zone. He said the region will be transformed into an area of progress, development and wealth. Kenyatta called for free movement of people, goods and services across borders of African countries saying the continent cannot develop without free trade. Museveni on his part lauded the initiative saying it will yield good results. "The moment you returned weapons, people have sired children who have since grown up," he said. Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa and Ugandaâ€™s Minister for Karamoja Affairs John Byabagambi Naitakwae signed the pact at Naitakwae Playgrounds, Moroto.
