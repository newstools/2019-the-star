The opulent living of some Kenyans posted on social media is admired by many people which ends up fueling cravings that result in the theft of huge amounts of money. People suspected to be police officers and G4S employees stole Sh72 million in the city. They were caught because they bought a new car. This shows how wealth is causing moral decay and resulting in selfishness. These vices have spread to the youths in Kenya. Kenyan jails will be full of people who want to be rich and powerful if we are not content with what we have. Mombasa
