Marriane Kitany, the former chief of staff in the Office of the Deputy President, has said she will attend her father in-law's burial on Tuesday in Igembe Meru. Despite her divorce process with Meru Senator Mithika Linturi, Kitany through her lawyer Danstan Omari, said she is going to pay her last respects to Linturi's father who passed away two weeks ago. "It is the honour and respect... she has a moral, cultural and legal basis to attend the funeral. Whoever will want to cause drama it will not be from our side. We want to pay respect," Omari said on Monday. Last week, Kitany, applied for an adjournment on her ongoing divorce case against Linturi. Kitany said she was not ready to proceed following the death of Linturi's father on Monday night. Omari said Kitany is in mourning and is in the process of going to her home in Meru to be part of her father-in-law's burial programme.
