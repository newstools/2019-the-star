The Kenya Universities Staff Union’s (KUSU) National Governing Council had demanded immediate resignation of all Maasai Mara University Council members to allow full and smooth investigation be conducted into the alleged corruption expose' of Sh 190 million. Speaking in Nakuru on Saturday, KUSU National Governing Council members said the move will give staff members with damning evidence, confidence to feel secure enough to come forth and provide information to the investigating agencies. Through KUSU Secretary General Dr. Charles Mukhwaya, the Council members said the union has continued to receive information from its members working at University that they were being threatened over any volunteering of information around financial and human resources impropriety. "Some of our men have genuine concerns on security of their lives largely due to the sensitive departments they work in coupled with what they know. This will enable them feel free to volunteer the same to investigators," Mukhwaya said . The Council members also want investigating authorities to expose other universities involved in corrupt deals and bring the culprits to face justice. "Even after raising a red flag on mismanagement in other universities including Embu and Masinde Muliro Universities, nothing has been done,” Mukhwaya said. Council chairman Dr. Samuel Ochola, while announcing the suspension of Prof Walingo, said they are ready to cooperate with Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and that no staff will be victimised for speaking to DCI officers. “No staff will be victimised as we will use the internal mechanism to deal with those involved,” Dr Ochola had said. Maasai Mara Vice-Chancellor (VC), Prof Mary Walingo has since been sent on compulsory leave after she was implicated in misappropriation of funds, fraud, and abuse of office.
