Nigeria have launched an ambitious attempt to convince Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham to snub England and represent the Super Eagles at international level. Following the retirement of Odion Ighalo after a third-place finish at the Africa Cup of Nations, Nigeria are looking for a new frontline striker. Camberwell-born Abraham made his England debut in a friendly win over Germany in November 2017 before appearing against Brazil a week later but is free to switch as he has yet to play a competitive match for Gareth Southgate. NFF President Melvin Amaju Pinnick said: “We will not relent in our quest for good players to play for the country and win laurels. We will keep talking to good players of Nigeria descent to play for their fatherland.” “But like you know, these kids are very independent-minded. In fact, we have been told to wait until April 2020, when he hopes to make a final decision on the matter. I told him that he stood a better chance of playing regularly for Nigeria than with England, which has a galaxy of strikers of the English stock.” Abraham has made a strong start to the season for Chelsea with four goals in six games after being given his chance in the first team by new boss Frank Lampard. The striker has also earned 25 caps for England Under-21s, scoring nine goals, but is no longer eligible due to his age.
