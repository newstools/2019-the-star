Ofweneke's baby mama Nicah the Queen has told off critics of her dress code, saying she can dress however she likes in her house. Nicah has of late been making headlines because of her dress code. Her photos on social media have left many criticising her and even others saying that she isn't living as expected of servants of God and a gospel artiste. Recently, she posted photos wearing a two-piece bikini showing off her humongous curves from behind, which she then deleted after trolls responded with mean comments. On Monday, she shared a video dancing to Ringtone and Rose Muhando’s new jam 'Walionicheka'. She was wearing a floral dress (which cut above the knee) and showed off her killer moves, yet once again, this didn’t go well with a section of her fans. She captioned the video, "Thank you, God, for the Peace and Joy that’s in my house. The praises in my house this night is on another level. Without you God I’m nothing!! I have every reason to be grateful. @ringtoneapoko this song is amazing….been jamming to it since." One of her followers, Dommy, wrote, "Vaa nguo za praise basi." The mother of two responded, saying, "I can wear whatever I like in my house. I can praise even naked. What’s your own?" Mzee wa Tanga said, "Why dressing na nyimbo haviendani? Ukiangalia original song kavaa vizuri kuliko huyu shame on her."
