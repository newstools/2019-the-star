Khayega DEB Primary KCPE candidates will write their exams next month in a church after area MP pulled down eight classrooms to build new ones. The pupils are learning at Pentecostal Church while the lower primary learners at Abundant Life (Afcea) Church. The classes were demolished two weeks ago by MP Justus Kizito and a storeyed building put up through the Shinyalu NGCDF. Other pupils have been moved to neighbouring Muranda and Mukumu primary schools. The school has 1,200 pupils and 13 teachers. One of the teachers told the Star by phone that the demolished classrooms were in 2012 condemned by public health officials but continued to be used due to lack of funds to build new ones. “Deputy President William Ruto brought the school Sh1 million early this year to purchase land for expansion but it could not be found so the school put up an ECD block," the teacher who requested anonymity said. Education officials declined to comment. “Why are you calling me on this one? You know that we do not discuss such matters with the media,” Kakamega county Education director Dickson Ongoyo retorted. MP Kizito neither answered calls nor responded to text messages. Area MCA Farouk Majanje said Kizito did not involve the community. “The MP should have involved us and waited for the long December holidays to start the works to avoid interfering with candidates' preparation for exams," Majanje said.
