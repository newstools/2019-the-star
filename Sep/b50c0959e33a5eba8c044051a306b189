Nyando MP Jared Okello has published a Bill that would compel hospitals and other medical facilities compelled to release all patients who are unable to pay for their treatment. The Bill also proposes that facilities that detain bodies or patients' documents over nonpayment should be fined Sh5 million. Whereas there is a need to regulate the cost of healthcare and to support the less fortunate in our society, the approach taken by Okello is wrong. If the Bill is passed and implemented it means that anyone could walk into any medical facility, get treated and walk away, claiming that they are unable to pay. Cost-sharing is practised the world over. It is the way that better-off individuals pay for the treatment of those unable to pay under a Universal Healthcare system. Cost-sharing is more sustainable and it's more likely that people will only seek medical care when they really need it — if they know they have to pay for some services. The primary objective of the MP and his supporters should be to reduce the cost of guaranteeing medical care, which, at least nominally, is achieved. The government should also fast-track the implementation of universal healthcare so Kenyans can enjoy medical services.
