Harambee Starlets assistant coach Jackeline Juma remains optimistic despite succumbing 3-1 to Kenya Under-15 boys team in a friendly match at Camp Toyoyo. Juma said the friendly was part of their training session as they fielded two different teams in each half. She added that it was an opportunity for the new players to showcase their skill. “The match was a fair one as we got to field two sets of players, some of whom are on trials. The squad that played the Junior Stars in our previous match took care of the first half while the second team played the other half. It was also a good opportunity to see the wellness and fitness of our players,”she said. Captain Dorcas Shikobe opened the scores for Starlets in the 18th minute but Joseph Munala replied in the 27th to close the first half in a stalemate. On resumption, Andrew Waliala grabbed a brace 10 minutes apart- in the 70th and 80th to settle the game at 3-1. The tactician observed that they attacked well but did not utilise the chances that came their way. Moving forward, she intimated that the team needs to polish up their defence ahead of their Olympic qualifier match against Ghana on October 4. “We now need to work on our defence. We had a lot of chances when we attacked but failed to maximize on them. Working on defence is a gradual process done on a daily basis but I am confident by the time we meet Ghana, we will be a notch higher,” she added.
