Khaligraph Jones and Nigerian superstar Rudeboy have released the video of  ‘Tonight’, a song they released during Coke Studio recordings. The music videos are giving an authentic African setting to bring the music on the show to life. Speaking about the video, Khaligraph said he was a little apprehensive when he was asked to cover Rudeboy's music, mostly because he would not be rapping. "I have a lot of respect for Rudeboy, given his vast experience in the African music scene. The outcome was a dope track that exceeded my expectations, and I thank my fans for urging me on," he said. The duo was paired up during episode two of Coke Studio Africa 2019, with Rudeboy doing a cover of Khaligraph’s song ‘Kasayole’, and the OG getting out of his comfort zone to give a sentimental spin of Rudeboy’s song ‘Reality’.
