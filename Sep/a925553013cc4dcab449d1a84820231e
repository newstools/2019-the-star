Jubilee nominated MP Maina Kamanda has thrown his weight behind ODM candidate Imran Okoth for the November 7 Kibra by-election. Kamanda spoke on Thursday after meeting ODM leader Raila Odinga at the AU envoy's office in Capitol Hill. "I am here in my personal capacity. The handshake brought us harmony and peace in the country. As Jubilee we have a candidate but as a person, I will be with the ODM candidate. I am here to stand with the candidate nominated by ODM Imran Okoth,‚Äù Kamanda said. The Jubilee nominated MP also urged Kenyans to wait for BBI outcome and ignore Punguza Mizigo Initiative sponsored by Thirdway Alliance leader Ekuru Aukot. The declaration comes a day after President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto assured Jubilee candidate MacDonald Mariga of their total support at State House, Nairobi. The President wished Mariga, who was accompanied by Jubilee Party Secretary-General Raphael Tuju, success in the contest and assured him of his full backing. Other leaders present were National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale and Jubilee Party Chief Whip Benjamin Washiali among others.
