@ddibondo Four Meru MPs have promised to support National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi if he decides to join politics in 2022. They are Halima Mucheke (nominated), John Paul Mwirigi (Igembe South) John Mutunga ( Tigania West) and Mpuru Aburi (EALA). They spoke on Sunday. Muturi, who hails from Embu county, has been making inroads in Meru and Tharaka Nithi counties seeking to consolidate his support in Mount Kenya East. This year, Muturi has attended three fundraisers in Meru county. He attended the first fundraiser in Buuri constituency, Central Imenti constituency and the latest was on Sunday at Nchuraine Methodist Church in Tigania West constituency. Muturi has, however, not openly declared that he wants to join politics. “Muturi has been with us all the way and when that time comes, we will support him as he is our friend,” Halima said. Aburi said that when he was in the National Assembly, Muturi displayed good leadership skills. “Merus are known to be loyal, so if we decide to back you, then we will do so overwhelmingly,” Aburi said. Mwirigi said in Mount Kenya East, Muturi has a lot of support. “Continue the good work and when that time comes we will rally behind you,” the Igembe South legislator said. Mutunga said Meru residents stood with former President Mwai Kibaki from the time he was the opposition leader until he became President. He said Mount Kenya region should rally behind a leader from Mount Kenya East as Merus have been supporting leaders from Central Kenya.
