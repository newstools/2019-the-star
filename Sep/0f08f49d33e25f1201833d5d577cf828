A special training rally to usher new talent into motorsport will be held this Sunday on the outskirts of Konza, Machakos County. The event will revive memories of the olden days' calendar when training rally events formed a part of the regular series alongside the main national Rallies. Former Safari Rally winner Azar Anwar has initiated the platform where newcomers wishing to play part in the future main rounds of the Kenya National Rally Championship events, can start doing it from the platform. Newcomers aspiring to be Safari Rally drivers are invited to the competition in standard vehicles to learn more about requirements and how to start rallying. Such drivers will be required to wear helmets and sign Indemnity forms before the event takes off. Anyone interested in joining the group as a rally driver, navigator, timekeeper, marshal or official is welcome to attend the occasion. It is a platform that seeks to spread practical knowledge and experience to the next generation of rally stars. Anwar is the RAIA autosportâ€™s chief coordinator and will have a large team of volunteers to help achieve their objectives. A total of sixteen entries have been received including rally cars, quads and buggies. The entry list has a mixture of renowned rally drivers. Anwar will be assisted by Abdul Sidi as head of the Abdul Sidi Rally Academy, who has provided theory lessons to newcomers in readiness for the Sunday event. Machakos County has provided two fully equipped Ambulances that will be on standby in case of any emergencies. Ketan Chibber, David Kioni, Anthony Tibo and Surinder Bharij are some of the senior officials of the meeting.
