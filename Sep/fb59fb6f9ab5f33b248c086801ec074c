In commemoration of Heart Awareness Month and World Heart Day set for September 29, the Philips Foundation and Kenya Red Cross Society launched the third phase of its successful ‘Back to Rhythm’ campaign, which has been raising public awareness of cardiac health. On September 21, Philips Africa organised a cycling challenge at Karura Forest. The principal aim was to help the ordinary mwananchi access the Automated External Defibrillator kit, which is central to saving heart patients’ lives.  Present were Philips East Africa director Roelof Assies, head of brand, communications and director Radhika Choksey and comedian Daniel ‘Churchill’ Ndambuki.
