Tana North pastoralists want administrators in Tana Delta subcounty to return their seized IDs and the police to stop harassing them over pasture. The herders left their area due to drought and had since May been in the delta region. Recently, Tana Delta security officers led by deputy county commissioner Charles  Akwanalo raided Jilojisi village and took away the identity cards of 27 pastoralists. The herders were ordered to go back to their homes. They were not told why their IDs were taken away after being evicted. Camel herder Mohamed Mahmoud Guracho said attempts to recover the IDs were futile as the authorities ordered them to first leave Tana Delta and thereafter send a representative to pick them. Guracho, who spoke in Malindi, said they bring their cattle, sheep, goats and camels to the delta every year and did not understand the reason for their eviction this year. ‘‘The pastoralists had agreed with the Jilojisi community to feed their animals at one water pan but now it’s dry,’’ he said. Guracho said he was harassed at the OCPD, DCIO and DCC offices when he went to inquire about the IDs. ‘‘The DCC told me that I would only be given the IDs if the pastoralists relocate from Tana Delta,’’ he said. Tana Delta OCPD Moffat Morema Mangera said five IDs had been returned but the rest had issues. Those who had not received theirs know the reason, he said. Muslim for Human Rights condemned the arbitrary arrests of the pastoralists and harassment. Muhuri boss Francis Auma said threats to civilians in rural coastal areas have escalated recently in the name of curbing crime. ‘‘The taking of IDs and detaining them is unacceptable and abhorrent,’’ Auma said in a statement. He said the IDs must be returned to the owners unconditionally.
