Japanese ambassador Ryoichi Horie has urged Kenyan leaders to support development projects initiated by foreign countries. Horie said foreign countries have spent a lot of funds to put up infrastructure projects in the county which will bring more benefits if supported by leaders. He spoke on Thursday at Kondoro Primary School in Migori when he handed over two classrooms, six toilets and 50 desks worth Sh2.8 million. The project was sponsored by the Japanese government under the Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Projects. “The project aimed to improve the welfare of Kenyans through infrastructural development especially in learning institutions with the objective of improving the educational environment for learners,” he said. He said similar projects demonstrate the strong ties of friendship between Japan and Kenya, adding that Kenya is the largest recipient of Japan's ODA in Sub-Saharan Africa for several decades now. “We have been working closely with Kenyans and leaders, which has improved our ties as more is needed to be done,” he said. His sentiments were echoed by Migori county director of education Elizabeth Otieno who said Japan has helped improve education infrastructure. “As leaders we will continue to work closely with foreign governments and other investors and donors to improve infrastructure,” she said. They were hosted by Migori Woman Representative Pamela Odhiambo and Rongo MP Paul Abuor.
