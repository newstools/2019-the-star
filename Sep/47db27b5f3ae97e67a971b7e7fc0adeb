Kenya second-string Sevens squad Morans will have an opportunity to play in various satellite tournaments this coming season. Kenya Rugby chairman Oduor Gangla yesterday said with the talent at their disposal, it's important for them to create depth for the future events. Some of the major international satellite events include the Dubai Invitational, Roma Sevens, Singapore Invitational and Sudamerica Sevens in Argentina. Gangla said it's unfortunate that the Morans only play the Safari Sevens which is not ideal if players are to play for Shujaa squad. "It's quite tough when you expect the players to perform at their best when called up to Shujaa squad. We want them to play in these tournaments to build their confidence and sharpen their skills before they play for the main team,” added Gangla. He said he expects an improved display from Shujaa especially with the arrival of new coach Paul Feeney. "This is especially as far as the Olympic qualifiers and the World Sevens Series are concerned. Some of the players started their training in August and with Feeney's arrival, strong technical bench and sponsors, I believe we will have a good season ahead,” he added. The Olympic Sevens men's qualifiers are slated for November in Johanessburg and Kenya Sevens will use next month's Safari Sevens as build up. The women's qualifiers are scheduled for Tunisia next month. Elsewhere, Nondies have re-elected Auka Gacheo as chairman.  In a statement, Gacheo was re-elected to serve for another term over the weekend.  Arune Hicks retained her post as the secretary. The club also introduced the general manager's post with Kevin Were being appointed to serve in the position. Nondies improved their position in the Kenya Cup, narrowly missing out on the playoffs while they finished sixth in the national Sevens circuit with 68 points. The club will be keen to qualify for the playoffs in the upcoming season and be competitive in their matches.
