The Council of Governors has dismissed claims that it received money from the national Treasury. Chairperson Wycliffe Oparanya on Wednesday said the council was shocked by the statement made on Tuesday by the Acting Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani that counties have received their money. Yatani had said some Sh50 billion had been disbursed to the devolved units. But Oparanya in a press statement said the  money can only be disbursed to county governments once the County Revenue Allocation Act has been approved. He said the money can only be disbursed after being gazetted and approved by the office of the Controller of Budget. " We take this earliest opportunity to inform the public that up to the release of this statement, no money has been disbursed to County governments as alleged," Operanya said in the statement. Oparanya who doubles up as the Kakamega County boss said such kind of statements from the Treasury will make county governments be seen as unresponsive. Yatani had indicated that President Uhuru Kenyatta signed into law the Division of Revenue Allocation Bill, 2019, which allocated  Sh50 billion to counties. Yatani also thanked the Senate and National Assembly for approving the bill which allocates a total of Sh378.1 billion to the devolved units. He said the amount included Sh316.5 billion for the equitable share of revenue raised nationally, while Sh61.6 billion comprised of conditional allocation to counties.
