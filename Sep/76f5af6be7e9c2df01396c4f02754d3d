Award-winning Nigerian artist Tiwa Savage has announced that she will no longer travel to South Africa to perform on September 21. Tiwa's move is in protest over the ongoing xenophobic attacks across South Africa. Tiwa took to Twitter on Tuesday to slam the "barbaric butchering" of her fellow countrymen in the South African nation. Tiwa was set to perform at the upcoming DStv Delicious Festival in Johannesburg. "I refuse to watch the barbaric butchering of my people in SA. This is sick," she said. "For this reason, I will not be performing at the upcoming DStv delicious Festival in Johannesburg on September 21. My prayers are with all the victims and families affected by this." Burnaboy said that he will never set foot in South Africa. "I have not set foot in SA since 2017. And I will NOT EVER go to South Africa again for any reason until the SOUTH AFRICAN government wakes up and really performs A miracle because I donâ€™t know how they can even possibly fix this," he tweeted. Other Nigerian artists including Wizkid, Davido have also expressed their anger over the violence but called on Nigerians not to retaliate.
