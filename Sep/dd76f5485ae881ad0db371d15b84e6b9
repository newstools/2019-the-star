 A man yesterday was charged with breaking into a Butchery and stealing gas cylinders used to cook meat. Court documents indicate that on September 6 in Nairobi's Dagoretti subcounty, Joseph Matangano forcibly entered Feathers Butchery, hit the watchman on the head with a metal bar. He then stole the items. According to the charge sheet, Matangano stole six gas cylinders, banners and grills both valued at Sh16800 from the property of Lawrence Isingu. Appearing before Kibera senior principal magistrate Esther Boke, he denied the charges. It is alleged that the accused was arrested after the security guard recovered and pursued him. He was taken to the police station. Yesterday Matangano requested lenient bond terms. He was granted a bond of Sh300, 000 and a cash bail of Sh50,000 with the surety of the same amount from a credible contact person. The magistrate directed the matter to mentioned on September 9 and heard on November 20. (Edited by V. Graham)
