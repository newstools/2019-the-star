The Milimani Law Court has released a suspected linked to the importation of counterfeit goods using fake KRA stamps on bail. Jane Mary Muthoni Gichengo is accused of importing goods worth Sh900,000 ready to drink excise duty stamps and Sh960,000 counterfeit spirits excise duty stamps concealed as labelling stickers among other goods at JKIA. She denied the charges before chief magistrate Francis Andayi and was released on a Sh2 million cash bail with an alternative bond of Sh3 million. The value of the counterfeit excise tax stamps was not indicated in the charges. Her case will be mentioned on September 30th. Muthoni Gichengo was arrested on Friday last week upon arrival from China. KRA said the suspect is part of a criminal network that manufactures excise stamps in China and consigns them to Kenya under concealment. The taxman said that the manufactured stamps are distributed through a locally-based cartel. The cartel, KRA said, distributes stamps to alcohol manufacturers and distributors who end up evading taxes to the government. On April 24, 2019, officers from KRA acting on intelligence intercepted a consignment containing 11 packages of counterfeit excise stamps at JKIA imported from China. The consignment declared as 189 packages containing mobile phone accessories valued at $3,750 had been exported by Jia Mei International Trade in China and consigned to Buush Investments Limited in Kenya. During the joint verification of the consignment, KRA and Revenue Protection Services officers found concealed counterfeit excise stamps and other undeclared goods consolidated.
