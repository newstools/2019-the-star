Nandi Governor Stephen Sang has sacked three county executives over graft allegations. In a statement on Tuesday, Sang said two of the executives -Engineer Hillary Koech (Transport ) and Stanley Baliach ( Lands)- had resigned on their own accord. Education executive Valentine Chumo was also sacked. “This was necessary in order to stay on course for our transformation agenda," Sang said. "There is a need to re-examine and asses the performance and output of officers and departments in the county." The executives had earlier been suspended after the graft allegations in their departments were unearthed three months ago. Changes To streamline the sector, Sang has nominated three people who will be vetted by the county assembly to replace the executives. They include; Drice Rono ( Transport), Philemon Buret ( lands ) and Grace Sugut (Education). Sang also nominated Francis Sang for the position of County Secretary in Nandi. In the same changes, the governor reassigned several chief officers. Solomon Mang’ira will be Chief Officer for Lands, Sally Kemboi (Water and Sanitation), Phillip Towett (administration and public service),  Paul Lagat (Health) while Scolastica Tuwei will be the chief officer for Social welfare. Daniel Sang was reinstated to the position of Chief Officer for Education. He also nominated five people to serve in the County Public Service Board if approved by MCAs after vetting. They include Ezekiel Kiplimo, Arusei Eliseba, Daniel Mwogoi, Jacob Sisey and Irene Choge.
