Owner of Precious Talent Top School Moses Ndirangu has been detained 15 days. Making the ruling on Friday, Kibera Chief Magistrate Joyce Gandani ordered police to get reports from Ministry of Education and Urban Planning. “Death of a single pupil is catastrophic. Thorough investigations need to be conducted,” she said. Earlier, the police sought for more time to hold Ndirangu after a classroom in the school collapsed on Monday killing eight and injuring 65. In his application, the officer in charge of the investigations Earnest Kinyua sought to detain  Ndirangu for 15 days to complete investigations. Officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigation on Thursday arrested Ndirangu. The arrest puts to rest public calls to have someone accountable for the deaths of eight learners and injury of more than 60.
