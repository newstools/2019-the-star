Suzan General Trading JLT had sought among others an order to stop KRA from enforcing the warrants and distress notices issued on 9th July 2018 in respect of customs duty. The company had also sought to stop KRA from interfering with its business operations on account of the debts owed to KRA by Duty-Free Limited.
