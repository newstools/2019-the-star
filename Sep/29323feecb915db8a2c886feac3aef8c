Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot has criticised political leaders who are against his Punguza Mizigo Bill. Aukot said on Thursday in a press conference that the bill will ensure that more resources are sent to the counties. “Leaders who have opposed this bill have refused to understand it. Why would you oppose more money going to your county?” The party leader said the bill gained overwhelming support across the country "only to be hijacked by selfish politicians who are benefiting from the current system". “The leaders who are telling lies about this bill have failed the integrity test contained in Chapter 6 of our Constitution,” Aukot said. He accused critics of not reading the entire document to understand it before throwing stones. Aukot said ODM party leader Raila Odinga was the ring leader against his Punguza Mizigo Bill. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang'ula of Ford Kenya were not spared by Aukot. “Moses Wetang'ula, Kalonzo Musyoka and Otiende Amolo are lawyers who I expect to read this bill and critique it on its merits or demerits or offer alternatives but have chosen the low level of telling lies,” he said. He accused Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru of intimidating MCAs to dismiss it. Aukot added that the bill will outline integrity issues which he alleged Waiguru had failed to meet. Aukot said some leaders have been telling lies that some counties will be merged, contrary to the reality contained in the 17-page document. “If you cannot read a 17-page document, then how are you reading Bills that are being passed in Parliament which are complex?" he said. His sentiments towards Punguza Mizigo opposers come after a public spat on social media with Waiguru. Kirinyaga MCAs voted against the bill, and Waiguru applauded the ward representatives, saying the bill was an 'unfortunate embarrassment'.
