Inspector General of police Hillary Mutyambai should order the beefing up of security near Museum Hill flyover which has been taken over by armed gangsters attacking people from 7pm on a daily basis. Over the years, I have seen pedestrians being attacked by robbers armed with knives and other crude weapons, many ending up maimed and hurt. After robbing their victims, these dangerous gangsters working in groups of two to four disappear into the bridge near the flyover, finding their way into the bushy Nairobi National Museum land adjacent to Boulevard Hotel. They normally jump into the Nairobi River after carrying out their evil mission leaving their victims with scars. The Nairobi National Museum should properly fence their land around Nairobi River and across the bridge to Boulevard hotel. Museum Hill is popular with local and international tourists, university students finding their way to and from the Museum and campuses around, hence being magnets for hoodlums. Some of these gangsters hide under the flyover and open spaces around it which have no security lights, CCTV or any kind of surveillance. Initially, the gangsters used to operate in Westlands near where a giant fig tree until security lights were installed forcing them to migrate to the unwatched Museum Hill territory where they now operate with ease.
