A 60-year-old granny is one of two suspects arrested over links to the Sh72 million city heist. According to the DCI, the two were arrested by sleuths from the DCI's Special Crime Prevention Unit before some Sh2,389,000 was recovered from them. The money recovered was in denominations of Sh1,000 new Kenyan currency notes. The duo was arrested at Kalumoni in Machakos County. The DCI said one of the suspects John Kamau Mulei is a brother to Bernard Mwendwa, a G4S officer who was arrested after the heist. “Upon his arrest at Muumandu village in Machakos, Kamau led the detectives to his grandmother (2nd suspect) 60-year-old Mary Kyalo in whose house the Money was recovered,” read a tweet by the DCI. Officers are still combing the scene as further investigations continue.
