The 4th edition of East African Community Arts and Cultural Festivals kicked off in Dar Es Salaam on September 22. More needs to be done to increase awareness of the Jumuiya ya Africa Mashariki Utamaduni Festival (Jamafest). A majority of Kenyans, Ugandans, Tanzanians, Burundians and Rwandese know about this regional event. The week-long event should be advertised and publicised all over the continent and the world to increase participation. The theme of the 2019 edition of the Festival is ‘Cultural Diversity: A Key Driver to Regional Integration, Economic Growth and Promotion of Tourism’. If more players participated in the event, trade across East African borders would be increased together with achieving better relations in the region.  Mombasa
