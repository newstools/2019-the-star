After skipping the Africa Games last month, 3,000m steeplechase top guns bring rivalry home during the World Championships Trials set for September 12 and 13 at Nyayo Stadium. World record holder Beatrice Chepkoech, two-time World U-20 champion Celiphine Chespol, 2015 world champion Hyvin Kiyeng and 2011 world bronze medalist Mercy Wanjiru headline the list of athletes to take part In the invite-only trials. Although Chepkoech got a wild card after winning the Zurich leg of Diamond League in 9:03.83 last month, she will still compete in the Trials. Her qualification means Kenya will field four runners in the water-and-barrier race at the Worlds. Jeruto, 23, who had a bright junior career and boasts of a personal best of 8:59.62,  is the 2016 Africa Championships 3,000m steeplechase winner (9:25.07). Wanjiru, the only soldier on the women's start-list is the Kenya Defence Forces 3,000m steeplechase champion and a silver medallist at the 2019 AAG. With Kenyans—Chepkoech, Kiyeng, Jeruto and Daisy Jepkemei having swept the Zurich Diamond League in that order, the event promises to be blistering. The four athletes are among a field of nine who will be vying for three slots for the World Championships scheduled for September 29 in Doha, Qatar. Also in the mix are South Rift's trio of Mercy Chepkirui, Fancy Cherono and long-time 3,000m SC pace setter Caroline Tuigong. Chepkirui's recent best time is 9:23.59 clocked in May 2019 in Shanghai, China while Cherono's best performance this season is 9:31.00 at the same venue. Tuigong fastest time this year is 9:36.36 ran in Rehlingen, Germany on June 1. The trio of Chepkoech, Kiyeng and Jeruto are ranked top three respectively in their speciality by IAAF as Chespol and Jepkemei are fifth and seventh.
