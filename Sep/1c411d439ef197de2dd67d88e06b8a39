Governorsnew laws compelling counties to procure medical supplies from Kemsa quashed. The Council of Governors on Thursday sued the National Assembly over the Health Laws Amendment Act which MPs introduced and passed. The Act was subsequently signed into law by President Uhuru Kenyatta on May 13 and came to force four days later. The county chiefs complain that the effect of the law is jeopardising service delivery. TheÂ  Attorney General has also been listed as a respondent. The Kenya Medical Supplies Authority, counties say, is unable to meet their demands and in some instances, delays in supply take up by up to three months. "If Kemsa is not able to meet the demand 100 per cent, counties will be forced to wait for fear of the hefty Sh2 million fine or five-year jail term imposed on anyone who contravenes the new law," the court was told. Governors believe that apart from making service delivery difficult, it is also unconstitutional 'as it contradicts the very foundation of devolution and the distinctness of county governments'. Also pointed out is the lack of public participation before the law was introduced and passed. The governors argue that health service delivery in counties will be adversely interfered with and lives of Kenyans put at risk if the court does not intervene. They asked the court to take note of recent reports that at least 13 counties are experiencing drought saying the new law is limiting the ability of counties to procure emergency supplies. The new law was also not forwarded to Senate for further consideration as required by the Constitution, the CoG said. The case was certified as urgent by Justice James Makau and will come up for hearing on September 11. Edited by R.Wamochie
