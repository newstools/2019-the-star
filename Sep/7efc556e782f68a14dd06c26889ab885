Kenya has become a hotbed of fraudulent practice and it gets worse by day. Massive looting, embezzlement of funds, conning and abuse of public office being the order of the day. Greed in public and private institutions has resulted in misappropriation of public resources. People holding high job positions drain such institutions of public funds and this has become a norm since they will be arraigned, granted bail and walk free to continue with fraud. Audit process–both internal and external–which should take note of red flags and inconsistencies in such institutions, is seemingly joining the game of graft. The Judiciary needs to up their game and take this matter by its horns. Taxpayers’ money is being thrown into the gutter and someone needs to take responsibility.  Via Email
