A Nyamira court has acquitted 10 former Bomet county staff charged with irregularly authorising the release of Sh523,000 for the renovation of former Governor Isaac Rutto's residence. Senior resident magistrate M O Wambani in the ruling on Friday said the prosecution failed to show substantial evidence that links the accused persons to the alleged crimes. The employees from administration, finance departments and the tender committee have been facing various charges since 2016. The individuals include the then Finance chief officer Rose Kositany, head of accounts Bernard Koskey and chief officer in charge of administration Kilelson Mutai. Kositany and Koskey had jointly been charged that on January 22, 2014, they unlawfully authorised the payment of Sh523,120 from public revenue to Flexcom Company for the supply of construction materials for renovation of the residence. The project was not planned or budgeted for. Kositany and Mutai also faced anotherÂ charge of unlawfully failing to appoint an inspection and acceptance committee to carry out inspection and acceptance of renovation of the building as required. The structural engineer for the project, Kipkemoi Ngeno, faced three counts of making false documents, deceiving and misleading an EACC investigator by presenting fake letters which he purported to have okayed for the implementation of the project. Corazon Chepkoech, Philip Cheruiyot, Ezekiel Chirchir, Michael Langat, Joseph Kiprono and Joel Langat who formed the tender committee, were charged with two counts of willful failure to comply with applicable procedures and guidelines relating to procurement and carelessly failing to comply with applicable procedures relating to the Public Procurement Act.
