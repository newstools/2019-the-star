Meru’s upcoming musician Single L says the former Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki made her millionaire at age 16. Lynn Kendi, whose stage name is Single L, said she is proud of the former President because he and his handlers supported, promoted and nurtured talents. “Kibaki was the best President in the history of Kenya. He fully supported the youth. I cannpt regret him coming back to the seat. During his time ‘Vijana Na Kibaki’ was the best. He made me a millionaire at 16. I was paid until I wondered where to take the money,” she said. Single L said she used the money to pay for her education as there was no one supporting her. She said her stepmother rejected her and her father did not pay her fees, forcing her to move around in six shools during her secondary education. “I remember a certain headteacher cried when she called my father to ask him to pay school fees but he responded saying, I don’t think I have such a child. ‘Was it wrong number?’ she asked, I told her ‘no’,” Single L said in Meru town. She said they have now reconciled and all is well. Single L said her fans should expect more music. The 2016 Mwafaka Award winner said the award motivated her and made her believe in herself and trust that nothing is impossible despite the sorrows and challenges one faces. The Nimekuja hitmaker, featuring Jackline Kotira, sold chips at the roadside to raise money to produce her songs. She has five albums—Wanijali, Mateso, Nimekuja, Marieta and Aana Baaku. The mother of two is married to Keith Mureithi. Single L said she only had Sh10 when she went to a studio to record her first song. When the producer turned her away she started crying. The owner of the premises came along and found her still crying, and gave her a new lease of life. Single L said she is self-made and has no role model but is inspired by good music.
