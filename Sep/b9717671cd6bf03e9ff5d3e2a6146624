Kisumu MCAs have realigned assembly committees despite uncertainty whether impeached Speaker Onyango Oloo will return or not. Oloo says the removal on Wednesday last week was unprocedural and illegal; he says he is still the speaker. His next course of action has not been disclosed. If he does return, the changes made in his absence are likely to be invalid. Last week a report on the house committees’ reconstitution was tabled by Selection committee chairman Kenneth Onyango and adopted by the MCAs. Onyango who is also the majority leader stated that the reconstitution of the committees was done in consideration of equity and regional balance. He said the equitable distribution of committee slots will end the antagonism that resulted from the previous realignment of the house committees. “These changes are meant to improve operations and legislation in the county,” Onyango said. Assembly leaders and some MCAs have complained that committees were not delivering on their mandates. In the committee changes, Kolwa East MCA Steve Owiti, who was controversially removed from the Budget committee chairmanship, has been reinstated replacing Central Kisumu's Judith Ogaga. Acting Speaker Elisha Oraro directed the committees to retreat yesterday (Monday) to elect their chairs and vice chairs. Oraro said the committee chairpersons after taking the oath of office will elect a new assembly liaison chair. The liaison chair is currently Kajulu ward representative Ry Samo who is a close ally of Oloo. Reconstitution of the committees came barely days after the assembly leadership changes that saw MCAs allied to Oloo kicked out of their positions Kaloleni/Shauri Moyo MCA Prisca Misachi was elected chief whip to take over from Gard Olima. Nominated MCA Jennifer Obonyo took the deputy chief whip position with  Nyalenda A ward representative Richard Ogendo becoming the new deputy Majority leader. (Edited by V. Graham)
