HIV-Aids prevalence in Turkana county has dropped drastically from 7.6 to 3.2 per cent. The county attributes the success to collaboration with Elizabeth Glazier Pediatric AIDS Foundation. EGPAF has been in Turkana for the last 10 years dealing with HIV-Aids and other disease like TB and pneumonia. Eliud Mwangi, country director of EGPAF, said they have been working with communities in Turkana to improve HIV prevention, care and treatment. “We have also helped reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV by establishing a testing centre in Turkana where pregnant women carrying the virus can be treated to avoid passing the virus to newborn. So far we have helped over 7,000 people especially training them on how to manage HIV-Aids through use of drugs,” Mwangi said. He addressed the media ahead of the orgnisation's departure to pave way for AMPATH PLUS to take over. Turkana executive for Health Jane Ajele thanked EGPAF for the support they have given the county. Mary Akai, a beneficiary of EGPAF program, has received trainings to assist with HIV-Aids live normally. Yohana Nameyen who lives with the virus joined the EGPAF program and has managed to live better and helps 30 men in Turkana North.
