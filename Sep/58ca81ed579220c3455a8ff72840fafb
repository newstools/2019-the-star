Detectives have arrested three individuals in Kamkunji who were caught red-handed repackaging expired rice into local brands bags. The operation was carried out by a multi-agency team which seized over 150 bags of assorted rice brands. The three suspects are Abdikafi Ahmed, Abdirizack Ahmed and Liban Ahmed Abdille. The three are in police custody waiting to be arraigned. Police also confiscated other items from the operation including a lorry. A similar operation was carried out in May, where police raided a go down in Kariobangi South, Nairobi where expired rice and sugar were being repackaged. Three suspects who were busted repackaging the expired rice from the sacks branded as 'Amar' and 'Day to Day' into new sacks branded 'Red Rose' and 'Pick-Cock'. In July, Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti and Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji regretted that an influx of toxic contraband could be derailing efforts to curb the surge of cancer cases. “Contraband is not just about substandard goods. It is also about goods that should not be consumed at all. We are consuming poison, goods that have been declared unfit for human consumption.” DPP Haji said corruption is curtailing the fight against contraband and human trafficking. “Corruption is exacerbating this threat. We are trying to work together to see how we can minimise the threats.” The two spoke at a regional conference that brought together prosecutors, investigators and deputy attorneys general from Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, South Sudan, Djibouti, Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya.
