The Mau Forest water tower should be conserved. Human settlement is destroying the source of water. Water is life, water is the most precious commodity for all creatures. There should be no debate on the issue of protecting the country’s biggest water provider. Who came first in Mau? Is it the forest or the people? The people are the cause of conflict with nature. Tree are creatures, let’s allow them and all other species to also live. Let’s preserve the voiceless trees and millions of species whose existence is under threat by conserving them. The forest will, in turn, give us rainfall which will result in abundant food. Hunger will have no room in Kenya and after the cases of drought we witnessed recently– some of which are ongoing– we should look at it from this angle.  Mombasa
