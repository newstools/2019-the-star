City Hall has donated Sh3 million for the reconstruction of the Githurai furniture market, also known as ‘Kwa Mbao’, that was razed by fire last month. Property worth more than Sh100 million was destroyed at the market that sits on 1.5 acres and accommodates over 500 traders. During the fire, beds, sofa sets, and other carpentry items went up in smoke leaving little to be rescued. Most of the furniture on display was finished products ready for delivery to clients. A large number of traders said that they had borrowed loans from banks and saccos in order to set up the business. In addition to the money, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko donated 1,000 iron sheets, 100kg of roofing nails, and other assorted fitting nails. The cause of the fire is still unknown. Githurai MCA Naftali Mathenge urged both county and national governments to address the issue of market fires as it was bringing misery to the traders. “We need to put an end to these on and off fire tragedies because our traders are suffering huge losses of property,” Mathenge said yesterday . Market fires are frequent in Nairobi with the Kwa Mbao fire incident being the third this year. In March, property worth millions of shillings went up in smoke at Toi market in Kibera. Gikomba market suffered the same fate in April but the causes of the fires have not been established.
