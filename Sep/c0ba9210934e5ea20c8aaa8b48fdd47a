EQUITY Bank lost their sting in overtime, going down 88-78 to Ulinzi Warriors in a top of the bill Premier League clash at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium. Bankers’ coach Carey Oketch said his charges posed all sorts of problems before losing their spark in a balanced encounter. Ulinzi should have won it for the soldiers at the death but Alvin Nyangweso missed an open shot as the buzzer sounded for a 72-72 stalemate. Both teams tied 18-18 in the opening quarter before Ulinzi went up 25-24 in the second. After the break, Equity took over 14-12 and 19-17 in the last two stanzas. “We switched off mentally when it mattered. We lost focus in the extra five minutes where we had no offensive rhythm and also played poor defence,” lamented Oketch. He added: “We missed eight layups in the fourth quarter and the injury of our shooter Faisal Aden also complicated manners.” Ulinzi tactician William Balozi noted: “I knew they were tired and I knew they were also in foul trouble so I told my players to drive more and cause fouls.” “Our offence was a lot sharper in overtime than in the normal time. My big men stepped up to make it easier for us,” he added. Eric Mutoro led Ulinzi with 23 points while Victor Bosire was key in overtime scoring 12. Dan Omondi shot 12 and Alex Oguso 11 for Equity.
