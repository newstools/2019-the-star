Kwa-Katile Primary School in Kyuso, Kitui county failed to reopen for the third term on Monday after parents blocked teachers and pupils from accessing the institution. About 50 parents arrived at the school in Masiki sublocation at about 7.30 am and barricaded the gate with thorny tree branches. Pupils and teachers arrived for the start of a new term but were turned away. The parents said they would not allow learning to take place until the headteacher is transferred. They accused him of misappropriating funds, disrespect and poor performance in KCPE exam. They said the school was also mismanaged and often looked untidy. An attempt by the area assistant chief Paul Katee to plead with the parents to allow the school reopen did not bear fruit. He sought the intervention of officers from Kyuso police station fearing violence. “The parents were adamant when I spoke to them. They said they wanted the headteacher, Andrew Ndithya, transferred for running down the school,” Katee told the Star on the phone. Kyuso subcounty police commander Charles Machinji said officers visited the school and found no learning or activity taking place because teachers and pupils had been turned away. “When the headteacher and his five colleagues arrived at the school, alongside two subordinate staff at the school, they were asked by the parents to go back home," Machinji said. He said the parents locked the doors to the school's administration block to deny anyone access. He said there was no violence and that the matter was reported to the subcounty education officer for appropriate action. edited by peter obuya
