Barcelona defender Samuel Umtiti has rejected speculation he could have left the club for Arsenal or PSG this summer. Umtiti, 25, was linked with a move to the Emirates before the Gunners signed David Luiz and was also rumoured to be a potential makeweight in Barca’s bid for Neymar. Neither move came to fruition and despite losing his place at Barca as a result of a spate of injuries over the past two years, he insists he was never likely to leave. “Honestly, I don’t know where this rumour with Arsenal came from,” he told Canal Football Club. “Overnight, I received messages from my friends ‘ah, so you are joining Arsenal?’ I’m not, I’m sorry but I’m staying at Barcelona.” “Contacts with Arsenal? To be honest, I don’t know if they had conversations with my agent, I just told him that I didn’t care what was happening this summer and that it wasn’t even necessary to talk to me about it. It was useless, I was going to have the same answer.” “My dream as a child is to play for Barcelona. Last season was the most difficult of my career, especially in terms of injuries.” Umtiti is currently recovering from a foot injury which has forced him to pull out of the France squad for their Euro 2020 qualifiers against Albania and Andorra.
