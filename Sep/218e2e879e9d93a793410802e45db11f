Former Kenyan Premier League top scorer John Makwatta is keen to inspire AFC Leopards to a top five finish. Makwatta claimed the top scorer's award in 2016 while at Ulinzi Stars courtesy of his 15 goals and he is looking to help Ingwe regain their prowess this season after joining from Kuwaitâ€™s Al Nasr. The diminutive striker who was part of the Kenyan Premier League All-Stars team that played Hull City junior side in 2017, joined the Zambian-based Buildcon FC in the same year and moved to Kuwait last year. The forward marked his return to the local scene last weekend in a barren draw against Kariobangi Sharks at the Moi Stadium Kasarani, where his second-half goal was ruled out for offside. His return to the KPL was touted as an avenue to rekindle his form after a rather a quiet stint with Al Nasr of Kuwait. He is among the goal poachers tipped to claim the 'Golden Boot' this season. However, the former Nairobi City Stars player is looking to lift Ingwe to a respectable finish after flirting with relegation for the better part of last season before settling for the 11th position with 43 points. "I made my mind to join Ingwe in the final minutes of the transfer window. We were in contact for long and decided to join in the last minute. There are other clubs which wanted my services but I ended at the den. My target for the season is to help the club improve on their performance and see if we can finish in the top five. I am more interested in teamwork than individual brilliance." The striker sparked a tug of war in final hours of the transfer window with Gor reported having beaten Leopards to his signature. However, all turned out in favour of Ingwe. "I am focused on helping my current club at the moment. The future will take care of itself. In the meantime, we have our next matches to prepare for and if we build on our second half display against Sharks, then we will bounce back to our winning ways."
