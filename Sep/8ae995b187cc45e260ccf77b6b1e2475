Homa Bay MCAs have called for the disbandment of the County Public Service Board over graft allegations in the employment of health workers. The county assembly claims the board received cash ranging between Sh200,000 and Sh300,000 from applicants, hired excess employees and even issued appointment letters to individuals who never attended interviews. In a report tabled in the House by Kanyamwa Kosewe MCA Nicholas Owaka, the board exceeded the number of health workers budgeted for by 22. It says 13 of the 143 positions advertised in the local dailies were not filled. He said this was contrary to what the board had alleged that there were no qualified individuals. The assembly heard that the board advertised 143 positions but ended up recruiting 165 employees. According to the report, two medical consultants (surgeon and radiologist) and another five registered clinical officers were not recruited. Owaka told the House five registered nurses II (theatre nurses) were not recruited, while four plaster technologists were engaged, instead of the required five. “I’m concerned with the way the CPSB conducted the just-concluded recruitment of health workers. There are allegations of outright bribery, which secured some individuals, who even never appeared before the panel, appointment letters,” the ward representative said. “The board claims to have filled the 13 positions—  which is not the case. This is a form of corruption. We must be told where the employees’ salaries will be taken to.” His Kagan counterpart Philemon Konditi said he is aware of what happened and the individuals who took the money and ready to testify over the bribery allegations.
