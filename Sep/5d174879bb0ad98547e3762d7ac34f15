The selection panel that will recruit new NCIC commissioners should exercise due diligence, Public Service Commission chairman Stephen Kirogo said yesterday. Speaking during the team's first meeting, Kirogo said the panel should go for individuals of high moral character and integrity. The panel is expected to pick the National Cohesion and Integration Commission chair and members. Kirogo said said the Constitution bestows immense power and independence on commissions, hence the need to be more meticulous in selecting holders of such offices. “Kenyans will rely on you to recruit persons who will have the capacity to exercise the powers given to them without fear or favour,” Kirogo said at his office in Nairobi. The members of the panel include Kang’ethe Thuku representing the Ministry of Interior, Simon Rotich (CEO, Public Service Commission), Concepta Wasilwa ( Attorney General’s office), Abdi Ahmed Mohamud (EACC), Priscilla Nyokabi (National Gender and Equality Commission) and Anne Amadi (Registrar of the Judiciary).
