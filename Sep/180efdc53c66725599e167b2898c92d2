A woman who allegedly invaded a Kilimani home and shouted that she was being raped by a Turkish tourist, has been charged with lying to the police. Patricia Nzau denied the charge before Kibera Chief Magistrate Joyce Gandani. Police said on August 26 in Kilimani area within Nairobi County, she reported that Kiran Sinani, the complainant, raped her after she visited him at his apartment in Kilimani. She was arrested and taken to Kilimani police station after the police realized that she had lied to them. Siran testified that he hooked up with Nzau on social media because her profile picture resembled that of musician Rihanna, whom he had liked for a long time. “On her profile picture she had posted the picture of the famous United State celebrity and I took her contact and we began communication,” he told the court. He displayed some phone messages and said that after a long phone conversation they agreed that the lady pays him a visit and when she arrived, he realised she had a different look. “I was shocked to see that someone who knocked my door resembled Hussein Bolt, the picture was different from the one I saw on the profile,” he told the court. He said that he persuaded the lady to leave but she declined and instead ordered him to pay her US$700 or she calls the police. “I was with friends and I decided to take her to a room so that we agree peaceful,” he said. He said that the lady refused to leave but reduced the amount to $300 claiming that he had wasted her time. On Friday, the magistrate ordered the matter to be heard again on November 12.
