Farmers in Wei Wei irrigation scheme in West Pokot have said they will grow other crops besides maize to control diseases. The farmers have been planting maize seed for long and now say they want to diversify. Speaking on Monday at the scheme, farmers chairman Mark Meut said they want to break the cycle of diseases related to maize. Meut said they advised farmers to plant short season crops, so that they don’t interfere with the calendar of Kenya Seed Company. “We want to break the monotony of mono-cropping. We have advised farmers to plant short season crops after they harvest maize seed,” he said. Some of the crops the farmers have been advised to plant are sunflower, sorghum, beans and peas to help add nutrients to the soil. Meut said after farmers harvest maize seed the farms lie idle as they wait for the next season. They should fully utilise the land, he said. “The entire county depends on irrigation for food. That’s why we want to maximise this land and ensure residents no longer depend on relief food,” he said. The chairman said this year they expect to harvest over 10,000 bags of maize seed to supply to Kenya Seed. He said the crop had done well after the county government supplied farmers with free seeds and fertilisers. “We have experienced a bumper harvest this year after farmers got help from the county government and this has increased our productivity,” he said. The Wei Wei Integrated Development Project was started in 1987 following the signing of a development cooperation agreement between the government and the Italian Development Corporation. Farmer Peter Lokir said the scheme has enabled many residents to pay school fees for their children and has helped develop Sigor town. “On market days we receive many traders from as far as Lodwar town who come here and purchase our products,” he said. He urged other farmers to plant short term crops since they have a ready market.
