With the looming Tokyo 2020 Olympics qualifier pitting Harambee Starlets against Ghana’s Black Queens, Kenyan coach David Ouma has named the provisional squad for the upcoming duel. The call-ups largely feature players who did duty in Kenya’s aggregate win over Malawi in the second round of qualification earlier this month. Ouma has however widened his scouting net to the FKF Division One League, calling up Limuru Starlets’ Hannah Mbithe. Kwale Girls forward Elizabeth Katungwa, a product of the Chapa Dimba na Safaricom tournament, also makes a comeback to the team, while Monica Odato (Wadadia) and Phiona Awino (Thika Queens) have been handed maiden call-ups. The first leg has been slated for October 4, with the second leg set to be played on October 8. The team’s departure to Ghana has been scheduled for October 2 and jet back on October 5, ahead of the second leg. Kenya beat Malawi 5-3 on aggregate in the second round and will be looking forward to a positive result against Ghana, who they held to a 1-1 draw in November last year in a friendly match played at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani.
