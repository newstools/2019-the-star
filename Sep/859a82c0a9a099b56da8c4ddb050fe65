The Cerebral Palsy Society of Kenya is calling on the government to conduct a census of persons with the condition. Cerebral palsy is caused by injury to the developing brain, mostly before birth, at birth or shortly after. Cerebral palsy's effect on body function varies. Some affected people can walk while others might need assistance. CPSK accused the government of omitting information about people with the disability in the just concluded census. “The government's call which underpins the President's Big Four agenda is leave no one behind. Are persons living with disability not being left behind when the census exercise is so skewed in favour of able-bodied Kenyans only?” said CPSK chairperson Dorothy Wanjiru. “The census questions are collecting data on intersex and albinism yet the global prevalence of these is approximately one in 1,500 and one in 5,000 respectively.” Wanjiru said despite requesting the relevant ministry and KNBS as early as 2017 to include disability type in data collection, the information is not being captured. “How does the government intend to provide for the needs of many people afflicted by CP over the next 10 years if it does not know the scale of the condition and important interventions required like access to specialised therapy, special needs education and disability friendly infrastructure?” she said. Centres for Disease Control estimates the number of people having cerebral palsy globally to be 17 million. There is not yet a statistics report on the number of people with cerebral palsy in Kenya but it is estimated that three in 100 children live withe the disability.
