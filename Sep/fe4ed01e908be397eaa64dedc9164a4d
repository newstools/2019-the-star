Young people tasked by the Nairobi City County to clean up the heavily choked Nairobi River have found another body. The latest body belonging to a middle-aged man brings the number of bodies found along the river to 16 since the exercise started. The chairman of Komb-Green Solutions which is assisting in the cleanup, Fredrick Okinda, said on Thursday that his group stumbled upon the body at around 8am. "The body which we stumbled upon has been collected by the police after we reported. It was picked up by the police before it was taken to the mortuary. We do not know what caused the death," Okinda told the Star on phone. He said the body was picked after they reported at Dandora police station. Okinda's team is helping the County government to make the city attain its "green city status in the sun." The identity of the body and the cause of death was not immediately established even as the police moved the body to the City mortuary. The team sprucing the river have had to contend with huge heaps of garbage, dead pigs, cats and dogs. Eight of the bodies have been found near the Korokocho slums. Okinda said the cleanup was going on well despite challenges.
