The Kenya Musicians Union and Kilifi county musicians are agitating for the lifting of the disco matanga ban. In January, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i said disco matangas have become a haven for criminals and must end by 11 PM. He said government records showed drugs were sold in the night events and young girls were preyed upon by rapists. “Cases of early pregnancy in Kilifi are associated with this nonsense called disco matanga. We have agreed today and informed the Kilifi county commissioner and his security team that all these must end by 11 pm,” Matiang’i said. On Tuesday KeMU Coast branch official Peter “PDay” Siku Karisa, accompanied by musicians David Matano, Alex Maitha, Billy and living legend Mzee Ngala met Kilifi Deputy Governor Gideon Saburi. The meeting was meant to pave the way for engaging top county officials and eventually Matiang’i. “The ban has had a very negative impact on music performances by musicians operating in Kilifi,” they said. It is believed that the ban has not achieved its intended purpose, which was to reduce the county's large number of teen pregnancies. The musicians said the ban has hurt the livelihood of hundreds of people who depended on live music performances to earn a living. Transport service providers, musicians, roadies (band technicians), distributors of soft drinks, palm wine (mnazi) sellers and many other service providers have been affected. KeMU is determined to have the ban lifted as soon as is possible.
