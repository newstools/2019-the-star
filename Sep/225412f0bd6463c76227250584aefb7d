Eddie Howe claimed he had never seen a player run as much as Lewis Cook did during his rehab after the midfielder capped his return with a starring performance against Everton. Howe handed England midfielder Cook, 22, his first appearance since last December in the Cherries’ 3-1 victory. Cook had been sidelined for nine months due to a serious knee injury and played in just two behind closed doors matches. But he justified his selection and Howe’s faith in his fitness as well as ability with an eye-catching display that earned him a standing ovation when he was withdrawn with 13 minutes left. Howe said: “He was hugely impressive. He’s missed a lot of football but he has done everything right in his recovery. He has put the yards in. I’ve never seen a player run as much as he has.” “He has had two behind closed doors game and looked really good in those. That’s why I selected him. He is very much the modern type of centre midfield player and we are just pleased to get him back now.” “We hope he stays fit and available for us and gets back to the levels he was consistently before because he was a huge part of our team.” Two goals from England striker Callum Wilson, taking his tally to three in two games inspired Bournemouth to victory and ‘will do him the world of good’ according to Howe who was also delighted with a first home win of the season. He added: “You don’t want to go too long without winning at home. We’ve been unfortunate in previous home games. We knew the importance today and it’s a great win against a good team.”
