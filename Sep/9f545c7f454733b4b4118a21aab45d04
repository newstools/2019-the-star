Kenya Sevens internationals Vincent Onyala and Jacob Ojee have been included in the KCB team for the Driftwood Sevens this weekend in Mombasa. The duo, who did not play at the Christie Sevens replaces Peter Waitere and Arthur Owira, who sustained injuries at the last weekend's tournament at the RFUEA ground. Onyala had an ankle injury from Prinsloo Sevens as Ojee had been rested. The duo's inclusion will be a big boost for the bankers with Onyala having been named MVP at the Kakamega and Dala Sevens. Ojee brings experience and leadership to the squad. The bankers need 13 points to be crowned series champions and coach Dennis Mwanja has said they are going all out to win the tournament.  “We are not resting on our laurels as we want to win it. Our target was to win all six tournaments but we have so far won three and there is room to win a fourth.  I'm confident the boys can rise to the occasion," added Mwanja. KCB face Administration Police (AP), Quins and Masinde Muliro University (MMUST) and Mwanja says they will take one game at a time. "We are not underestimating any team. Everyone will want to beat us and we must be prepared for the challenge they will pose in the pool matches,”  he added. He hailed the impact of Elphas Adunga, Samuel Asati and Shaban Ahmed in winning the Christie Sevens. "We have depth and for every position, we have two players. This keeps the squad fresh and brings healthy competition in the team,” he noted Mwanja. The bankers have 94 points from five tournaments— 10 ahead of Mwamba who lie second with Nakuru third on 83 points. Elsewhere, Homeboyz have made six changes for the Driftwood Sevens. Kenya 7s internationals Alvin Oteino and Mark Wandeto will captain the squad in Mombasa. Jan Remke, Brian Wandera, Brian Ayimba, Kitiva, Bryan Otieno and Amon Wamalwa all return to the squad after missing Christie 7s. They replace Collins Shikoli, Brian Song, Mohamed Omollo, Charles Omondi, Michael Wanjala and Augustine Lugonzo.
