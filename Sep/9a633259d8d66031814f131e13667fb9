Declan Rice has opened the door to playing for a club like Manchester United in the future but insists the timing wasn’t right this summer. Rice, 20, was linked with a move to Old Trafford before the Premier League campaign started but he ended up staying at West Ham. The England international was aware of the speculation linking him with a move to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side but is happy learning his trade at the Hammers. When asked by FourFourTwo about reports linking him with Manchester United, Rice said: “Don’t get me wrong, I think I’ve got the ability to play for a club like that. But it’s all about the timing and I don’t think the timing is right for me at all. I’ve still got so much to learn.” “I’m loving it at West Ham, the connection between me and the supporters is special. I’ve become one of the fans’ favourites and the manager likes me. It’s the best place for me to play my football.” Rice signed a long-term contract with the east London outfit in December with his new deal ending in 2024. And the former Chelsea academy prospect has revealed he would love to become a West Ham legend if he is to reject overtures from rival clubs. He added: “I’ve signed a contract here for the next few years and I’m looking forward to playing this season and the season beyond, so we’ll just see where it goes. To be called a West Ham legend in the future, maybe, would be a real honour.”
