Drivers of 2NK matatu Sacco on Wednesday attended a training workshop after the license of one of them was confiscated by NTSA for using his phone while driving. The training comes three weeks after the Sacco was ordered by NTSA to take responsibility and organise a road safety sensitisation for its management, drivers and conductors. The National Transport and Safety Authority also said the driver would be retested for competency. Sacco officials and the driver were summoned before a multi-agency team comprising of NTSA and the National Police Service to address the complaint received, leading to the order. Samuel Maina was driving at 100KPH from Karatina in Nyeri to Nairobi when he was photographed using his mobile phone. NTSA seized his badge while the Sacco removed him from its system after his photo went viral on social media, sparking an outcry from members of the public. Speaking to reporters during the training at the YMCA hall in Nyeri Town, Sacco chairman James Kahiro said the programme was meant to educate drivers on road safety. “We are heading to the closure of schools and the festive season when our roads are very busy and it is good for us to remind our drivers on proper behaviour on the road,” he said. Kahiro said the programme will run for two days with 400 drivers trained on Wednesday and the remaining more than 400 on Thursday. 2NK has more than 1,000 drivers. The chairman expressed hope the seminar will spark change in the drivers. The Sacco has been conducting such programmes yearly. “It is my earnest hope and prayer that comes December, we are going to close without a single accident on the road,” Kahiro said. The facilitators during the event included the traffic department of the police service and NTSA officials. Edited by R.Wamochie
