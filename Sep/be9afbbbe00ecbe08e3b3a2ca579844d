More than 1,000 youth will benefit from Shabaha Ya Wapwani programme aimed at offering business skills to curb poverty and illiteracy levels in Kwale county. Nominated Senator Agnes Zani said her objective for the project is to empower youths through mentorship and leadership skills. She spoke during the launch of the September phase of a driving classes programme in Matuga. “This programme is meant to assist and nurture talents from the young generation who have shown commitment towards achieving social, economic and political goals,” she said. The driving skills training falls under 'Vijana na Ajira' project, an extension of Shayawana initiative. Zani said they have also developed other scholarship programmes to make sure girls get an education. She said the initiative will enable teenage girls to tackle several issues including the early pregnancies menace. “We intend to stretch this programme into sponsoring girls. Bright but poor students in the region will be able to pursue their studies up to university or TVET),” Zani said. She said educating women will translate to development not only for the coastal region but also the entire nation. “Through continuous research, training, capacity building and creating linkages for women and youth to participate in learning will benefit the country’s economy,” she added. Shabaha Ya Wapwani Nalez initiative is a non-government organisation founded in 2013 by Zani. The programme has quarterly intakes that target 20 youth each.
