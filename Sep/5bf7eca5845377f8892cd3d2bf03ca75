Trouble-ridden Shabana beat debutants Muranga Seal 2-1 in an entertaining National Super League match at Gusii Stadium yesterday. Abou Traore gave Shabana the lead but Wilson Mwaura equalised for the visitors. Philbert Ochieng scored Shabana’s winning goal after a goalmouth scramble. Shabana coach Gilbert Selebwa admitted the game was difficult. “Murangá Seal are a well-oiled team. The win is encouraging for my team ahead of our trip to Mombasa next week," said Selebwa. The tactician only held one training session with the team on Friday with players having boycotted training earlier due to lack of payment. “We only trained once this week which made us struggle in the game. This is a very good team that can perform well if supported,” he said. Muranga Seal’s David Mahira was satisfied with the performance of his team despite the loss. “It was a balanced game. I have no complaints at all,” Mahira said. He added that his target this season is to maintain NSL status. Mt Kenya United recorded their first win of the season after edging Coast Stima 2-1. Musa Ekai and John Ndirangu scored for Mt Kenya while Joshua Oyoo scored Coast Stima’s consolation. The match Nairobi City Stars and Vihiga Bullets was rained off in the 76th minute with City Stars leading 1-0. Ibrima Sane scored for the visitors. The game will be replayed today at 10 am.  At Awendo Stadium, Bidco United beat Migori Youth 2-1.
