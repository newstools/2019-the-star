Kenyan-based Congolese singer Smart Djaba has released a love song called 'She Want'. Smart Djaba is a refugee living in Kakuma after fleeing from Congo. His father was killed in front of the family, his mother and sisters raped, and him being beaten until he lost some of his teeth and left for dead. "All I remember is that at 10 years old, I was drowning in a pool of my fatherâ€™s blood. The gunmen turned on me, beat me up until I lost my teeth, and later on I also became unconscious," he said. They were forced to flee, and in 2011, Smart Djaba and some of his family members arrived at Kakuma refugee camp, which he has called home ever since. He moved to Nairobi a few years back to pursue his music career and, as they say, the rest is history.
