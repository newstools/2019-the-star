Street children are just as human as any other human being have rights they need to be addressed. It is sad to see underage children begging for food while most people ignore them and act as they donâ€™t understand their plea. This could be because most normal people say the street children are thieves. Counties, the national government and other firms should work closely to help the children access education, a decent home and get off drugs that will ultimately turn them into thieves. Their future should be secured by giving them education.
