Education CS George Magoha has closed Precious Talent Primary in Nairobi for four days after seven pupils were killed and 64 injured after a class collapsed. "The school will be closed until Monday during which the building will have been inspected. We will then give an informed decision after that," he said. Speaking to journalists on Monday, Magoha said 62 learners have soft tissue injuries while two require more attention. Magoha who took responsibility for the deaths defended his quality assurance officers saying that the building might have slipped their minds. "You notice that somebody built another storey building on top of another one.. I must defend my quality assurance officers.. something like this can slip your sight.. I will take responsibility but I will continue to make sure that all things are done in the right manner," he said. "I have not come here to blame anybody. This single tragic incident must not be used to instillÂ fear in our children." Magoha said the government is going to assure safety of all children irrespective of where they come from. The Secretary of the National Building Inspectorate termed the construction of the wall as a deathtrap. Moses Nyakiongora said the fatal incident is a criminal offence.
