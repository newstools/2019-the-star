The county government of West Pokot county plans to turn Turkwel Dam into a tourist attraction by introducing boat racing. Governor John Lonyangapuo said the county wants to reap revenue from the dam. Boat racing will create job opportunities for youths who have abandoned cattle rustling, he said. The governor called upon investors to explore the county since security had been restored. “For the past two years cases of cattle rustling and insecurity have not been reported in this region and I call upon investors to come and help in opening this region,” he said. Lonyangapuo said his government will partner with Kacheliba constituency to set up resorts around the dam. “We call upon serious investors to come and help us in setting up resorts along the dam that will accommodate tourists who will be visiting the region,” he said. Turkwel Dam displaced hundreds of residents in the late 1980s and posed challenges to the community living around it,  like crocodile invasion and mosquito infestation. The governor said the dam has been under utilized yet it is the biggest man-made lake in the North Rift. Lonyangapuo said boat racing will attract participants to experience Pokot culture. Joel Lokomol, a boat rider, said the lake was a blessing to them as they have graduated from canoes to buying motor engines to make more money. Lokomol said since security was improved the number of people visiting the dam had increased. “We take them around the dam and they pay a small fee that has enabled us earn living,” he said. The ride gives one a good view of Riting Hills among several others. Along the Turkwel gorge lies the Nasolot game reserve that hosts black elephants and Nasolot Hill.
