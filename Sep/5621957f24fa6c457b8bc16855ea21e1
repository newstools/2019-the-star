Chelsea are confident the hamstring injury Emerson Palmieri’s suffered on international duty isn’t serious - but he is a doubt for Saturday’s clash against Wolves. The Italy left-back limped off in the eighth minute of their clash against Finland at the weekend causing concern that he could miss crucial games for the Blues. Frank Lampard will make a late call on Palmieri’s availability for the weekend visit to Molineux, but Blues medics are hopeful the defender is not facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines. It is understood his substitution whilst playing for Italy was precautionary. Palmieri felt his hamstring contract, but didn’t feel a serious tear - nevertheless, the Italians took the decision not to risk the full-back. Chelsea staff may feel it is too much of a risk to play Palmieri against Wolves on Saturday, but there is hope he won’t miss further games. Meanwhile, young right-back Reece James is poised to hand Lampard a key injury boost by returning to full training. James has missed the start of the season after undergoing ankle surgery in the summer - but he is due to recommence full training in the coming days. The 19-year-old will be given the opportunity to make the right-back slot his own by Lampard, who is a keen admirer of James’ abilities. Cesar Azpilicueta is currently Chelsea’s first-choice right-back - but Lampard is understood to be keen to provide James with an opportunity to impress once he returns to full fitness. The teenager was a target for a number of Premier League clubs in the summer - but Lampard insisted James had to stay at Stamford Bridge, a clear indication that he features in the Chelsea manager’s plans.
