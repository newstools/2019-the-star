 The high number of prostitutes in Lamu's mega-project areas has raised concern, with the administration fearing an outbreak of sexually transmitted diseases. Hindi and Mokowe towns have attracted most prostitutes mainly from upcountry counties. Local schoolgirls are also engaging in prostitution, according to county commissioner Irungu Macharia. The administration is worried that prostitution might discourage potential investors. The county has the Sh2.5 trillion Lapsset project at Kililana in Lamu West, the Sh200 billion wind project at Kwasasi in Hindi division and the Sh21 billion wind project to be set up at Baharini in Mpeketoni. The construction of the 135km Lamu-Garsen main road is ongoing. Construction workers seek comfort in the arms of these prostitutes, so do some security officers including KDF soldiers. The highest concentration of sex workers is in Hindi town from where Macharia raised the alarm on Thursday. Macharia feared an outbreak of  STDs and Aids. He called on parents and guardians to ensure that they know what their children are up to and instil good morals in them. “Hindi and Mokowe are areas of concern. There are so many people coming to work on these projects. We are worried about schoolgirls involved in prostitution.  They sell sex to labourers,  police officers and KDF soldiers,” he said. He asked the youth to get jobs in the projects instead of engaging in prostitution, which might eventually kill them. Human rights activist Stephen Mwai said prostitution was giving Lamu a bad name at a time when the first berth at the Lapsset site is due for commissioning by President Uhuru Kenyatta next month. Mwai said the prostitutes were also a threat to families and marriages. “Mega projects – Lapsset and road construction – are good but they have their dark side. Marriages will be broken. There will be HIV too," he said while cautioning residents to take charge of their lives.
