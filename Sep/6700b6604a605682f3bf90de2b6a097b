Deputy President William Ruto and six legislators have castigated those condemning their contributions in churches. Ruto on Sunday said he will always give donations to churches because he knows the value of doing so "as it comes with it a lot of blessings". Rubbishing critics of his donations to churches, the DP said there was a need to pray for them to see the light, saying they are in darkness. The DP spoke at St Peter and Paul Cathedral Parish in Embu. He was accompanied by his six allies; Muriuki Njagagua (Mbeere North), John Muchiri (Manyatta), Geoffrey Kingangi(Mbeere South), Eric Muchangi (Runyejes), Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira) and Sicily Mbarire(Nominated). Ruto said when people are blessed and get high offices, they get confused and forget God blessed them and thus fail to give back to the church. "I will never shy away from giving my donations. Those who are busy speaking ill about me and my contributions should let me be." Gachagua said they were not questioning where their critics take their money, adding that if it's not in church, it is not their business. He said it was selfish and absurd for some of the DP's critics to live in palatial homes while the houses of God were neglected. “I am afraid that those who are not giving their money to church are taking theirs to wizards for witchcraft and other dark places,” the lawmaker said. Muchiri urged faithful not to pay any attention to people who were complaining over church donations. Ruto donated Sh3 million and President Uhuru Kenyatta sent Sh1 million. Edited by R.Wamochie
