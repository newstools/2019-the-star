Music producer and businessman Tedd Josiah says raising his two-year-old daughter and managing his bags business is not easy. His wife Regina died in 2017, three months after his daughter Jay was born, and Tedd has since been raising her. "Staying focused on Jay and making a living to make her happy is the biggest challenge I have faced, because most of the times that I need to be doing business, I am with her," he told Word Is on Tuesday. "Sometimes when clients want to purchase our products and have conversations with me, she also needs my attention. " He says Mondays are always the toughest days for him because, over the weekend, it's him taking care of Jay without their nanny. However, Tedd says he takes pride in raising his daughter. "It is very tiring and difficult but since it is a commitment I made and I had purposed to have this child, I promised myself to take care of her. It was intentional. I pray that God will give me the strength to continue raising her," he said. On whether he is planning to marry again, Tedd says he has no plans as he is not ready to give attention to someone he calls a wife. "No plans to marry or even have more children, I am so good without a wife," he said.
