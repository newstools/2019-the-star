Nigerian acclaimed artist Tiwa Savage widely regarded as the African Beyonce on Friday released her new single, ’49-99′, via Motown Records. Tiwa signed a deal with Universal Music Group (UMG), the world leader in music-based entertainment in May 2019. The 49-49 single is her first release with Motown Records which serves as her US label. While utterly infectious, ’49-99′ makes a powerful statement about poverty. Tiwa Savage,39, in an interview with MTV base on Friday said  ’49-99′ is a term coined from the hard life many Nigerians go through. “The song encourages the young to put down the sense of inheritance and work for what they desire in life, for a better tomorrow. We can’t sit on our old glories and expect things to change for the better," she said. The single also addresses some political leaders who, instead of focusing on the growth of a nation, they focus on money and having affairs with underage girls. Tiwa recently recorded ‘Keys to the Kingdom’, a song that she co-wrote for the soundtrack ‘The Lion King: The Gift’ after being hand-picked to do so by Beyoncé. In 2018 was a remarkable year all-around for her after she scooped multiple awards. She scooped the Best African Act at the MTV European Music Awards, making history as the first female to win the award. She was later handpicked by Coldplay’s Chris Martin to perform alongside Beyoncé, Ed Sheeran and Jay Z live at the Global Citizen Festival to a 70,000 strong audience and millions across the globe. Savage’s fearlessness in  Music in combining a unique fusion of Afrobeat, R&B, soul and pop paid off, earning her an abundance of award nominations including four Channel O Music Video Awards nominations, five World Music Award nominations, two Headies nominations, MTV Africa Music, BET & MOBO Award nominations and many more.
