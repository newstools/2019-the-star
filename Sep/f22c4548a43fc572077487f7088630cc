Nairobi's Orange Democratic Movement Party MCAs have endorsed Imran Okoth's candidature in the November 7 Kibra by-election. Minority leader Elias Otieno on Wednesday said the ward reps will hit the ground to drum up support for Imran to ensure ODM retains the seat. “Our candidate is Bernard Imran Okoth and Kibra belongs to ODM so those other people are just tourists. Starting today you are going to see these MCAs campaign for Imran,” Otieno said. Otieno who is the Kileleshwa MCA refuted claims that he had pledged to support ANC party candidate Eliud Owalo when he attended a burial in Vihiga county last month. A video that has gone viral on social media appeared to capture Otieno saying that Owalo was the preferred candidate for the Kibra seat and condemning Imran for having the body of his brother Ken Okoth cremated. “Let Owalo not take advantage of what I said in Vihiga and use it to campaign. I said that because the ground was hostile but now we have our candidate and we are supporting him 100 per cent. There is no way we can go against the party,” Otieno said. He said that Imran was the best candidate because he was aware of the projects his brother was doing before his death in July and will carry on his legacy for Kibra residents. On his part, Imran who had paid the ODM MCAs a courtesy call at the county assembly, expressed his gratitude noting that he has received massive support from the party. “We have deliberated on recapturing the Kibra seat and also how we are going to work together during this campaign period. I must say the support from the party has been overwhelming,” Imran said. The ODM party is expected to officially launch its campaign in Kibra this Friday. The frontrunners for the poll are ODM's Imran, Eliud Owalo of ANC and MacDonald Mariga of Jubilee. According to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, 23 candidates have been cleared to vie for the Kibra by-elections. Seven are independent candidates.
