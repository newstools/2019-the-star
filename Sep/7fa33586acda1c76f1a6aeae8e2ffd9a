Kenyan elite athletes will attempt to hold on to the Berlin Marathon title won by Eliud Kipchoge in 2018 when they hit the German capital roads on Sunday. The spotlight will be on Felix Kandie and Jonathan Korir as they seek to bring back the title to Kenya in the absence of Kipchoge who finished in 2:01:39. The BMW Berlin Marathon is known as the world’s fastest race where 11 records have been set. The Kenyan men's party will be looking to land the Berlin Marathon title for the 18th time by the 15th Kenyan. The Kenyan pair will be under pressure to deliver on the day as they line up against Ethiopia’s Kenenisa Bekele whose best time is 2:03:03. Kandie currently holds the best time in the line-up at 2:06:03. Other strong Kenyans in the men’s race include Kennedy Naibei, Willy Ngelel, Abel Kipchumba and Bethwel Yegon. On the women's elite squad, Gladys Cherono, who is the title and course record holder, will be on the spot to defend her title. Cherono finished the 2018 race in under 2hrs and 19 minutes (2:18:11). The three-time Berlin Marathon holder, however, faces a tough contender in Ethiopian Mare Dibaba. Sally Chepyego is also a key contender in the Kenyan women's line-up. Meanwhile, the 2019 ‘BMW Berlin Viewerthon’ series will be hosted by Bank of Africa at Toby's Tavern Hotel in Eldoret. The live viewing of the Marathon is a forum that brings together athletes and marathon fans for a day of engagement and solidarity as they cheer the Kenyan team. The ‘Viewerthon’ session is a platform used to educate athletes on anti-doping matters and tax legislation affecting their day to day activities. “We believe that Kenyan athletes are an integral part of the country’s heritage. In line with the Bank’s CSR pillar of Sports, Arts and Culture, we are committed to growing and enhancing their craft as well as their lives,” said Jimmi Wanjohi, BOA head of marketing.
