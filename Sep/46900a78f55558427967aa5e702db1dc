Jubilee nominated MP Maina Kamanda on Sunday led ODM candidate Imran Okoth's campaigns in Kibra constituency. Kamanda hosted a delegation of members from the Agikuyu community in Kibra during a meeting with Imran. "Jubilee Nominated MP Maina Kamanda led Imran’s campaign this afternoon by hosting a delegation of members from the Gikuyu community in Kibra for meeting our candidate," ODM tweeted. Kamanda last Thursday declared his support for Imran for the November 7 Kibra by-election. Kamanda spoke after meeting ODM leader Raila Odinga at the AU envoy's office in Capitol Hill. "I am here in my personal capacity. The handshake brought us harmony and peace in the country. As Jubilee, we have a candidate but as a person, I will be with the ODM candidate. I am here to stand with the candidate nominated by ODM Imran Okoth,” Kamanda said. The declaration came a day after President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto assured Jubilee candidate MacDonald Mariga of their total support at State House, Nairobi. A section of women leaders last Friday allied to the Inua Mama movement wanted  Kamanda expelled from the Jubilee Party for endorsing an ODM candidate in Kibra. The team led by Kirinyaga Woman Representative Wangui Ngirici said the legislator had contravened the Political Parties Act by endorsing Imran Okoth instead of Jubilee’s MacDonald Mariga. “He has abused the privilege of being a nominated MP that we gave him as Jubilee Party. If he no longer holds the ideology of the ruling party then he should resign and join the opposition. His position can be given to other deserving leaders,” Ngirici said. The seat fell vacant following the death of Ken Okoth on July 26. The ODM candidate, Mr Imran Okoth, will square it out with Mariga of Jubilee, Eliud Owalo of Amani National Congress (ANC) and Ford Kenya’s Hamisi Butichi among others for the Kibra seat.
