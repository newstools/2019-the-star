 Kisumu doctors have been told to keep away from work until their salaries are paid in full. The Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentist Union on Friday said members should keep away from public hospitals until their demands are met. The medics have not been paid for two months. The union's directive issued by Nyanza chairman Lameck Omweri came just a day after health workers called off their strike following the signing of a return to work agreement with the county government. In the agreement, the county government will settle all pending salaries for July, August and September by October 4. In a letter sent to Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o, Omweri said the payment of salaries and remittance of deductions was not negotiable. He dismissed the return to work agreement as an alien document. “We were treated to yet another comical and regrettable return to work formula that the county government of Kisumu signed with itself on September 26. That is an alien document to KMPDU,” he said. “We authoritatively advise KMPDU members to keep off their workplace and continue with salary parade until the county government pays in full all salary arrears.” Omweri said doctors were suffering owing to non-payment of their salaries. The Thursday agreement was signed by county secretary Godfrey Kigochi, health chief officer  Dickens Onyango and union officials. “The employer shall also settle all pending statutory deductions by October 4 and the pending loans remission to respective financial institutions.  At the same time, they will engage with the respective banks to reverse all penalties charged to staff due to delay in remittance of loan deduction,” the agreement says.  edited by peter obuya
