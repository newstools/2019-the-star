Governor Sospeter Ojaamong, members of the executive and MCAs on Monday met  in a Busia hotel to review the status of projects in the county. Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi, speaker Bernard Wamalwa, clerk Allan Mabuka,  and chief officers were also present. Ojaamong who addressed journalists after the meeting, urged the executive and MCAs to cooperate and ensure projects are up to standard and are completed within set timelines. He told MCAs to do their oversight roles by monitoring projects' duration to ensure that they are completed within the shortest time possible. “The cabinet met on Sunday and passed the 2019-2020 supplementary budget; we shall ask for development funds as soon as the document is approved by the assembly and assented to,” he said. Three factories initiated by the county government between 2014 and 2015 have stalled. The Sh3.3 billion Everest Juice Factory launched by the governor at Ikapolok does not function. A Sh10 million cassava factory in Teso South that was expected to serve 15,000 farmers in Busia, Bungoma and Siaya counties is also not functioning. Another stalled project is an organic fertiliser factory built by South Korean firm Korangol. Ojaamong told MCAs that he will follow up on the projects. On Constitutional amendments, the governor said it is up to wananchi to decide  which is pro-devolution between Punguza Mizigo, Building Bridges Initiatives and others fronted by churches and civil societies. Deputy Governor Mulomi said beginning the end of this month; all status reports will include latest pictures of the project to dispel doubts as to the quality of the project.
