Newly promoted Kenya Cup side Kisumu RFC have named Ugandan Brian Makalama as their new coach. Until his appointment, Makalama was the Uganda national team assistant coach. He takes over from Howard Okwemba who guided the team back to Kenya Cup but his contract was not renewed. Makalama will be assisted by Dick Osano while George Henry is the strength and conditioning coach.  Caleb Rotich will ser as team manager while Shellan Nyawira is the technical director. The club's new chairman Charles Kutwa said the new technical bench will be charged with ensuring the team remains in Kenya Cup. Kutwa was elected during polls which saw Kisumu RFC player Jaycox Mwavale take over as secretary and banker David Wasamba elected treasurer. Wasamba will be assisted by Eric Ondiek while Mitchel Odidi is the new organising secretary. “At the moment, our aim is to maintain our Kenya Cup status. We started preparations two weeks ago,” Kutwa added. Ahead of the new season, the club has signed utility back Aggrey Kitoi from financially troubled KRU Championship side Kisii RFC, scrum-half Caleb Rotich (Catholic Monks), Ken Oduor (Menengai Oilers) and Rayn Moses (Maseno University). Other new signings are fullback Mike Owiye and winger Tony Wambogo.
