A couple in Nairobi's Njiru estate blames the police for its missing 25-year-old son, David Gitau. Gitau went missing on September 9 after he was arrested by officers from Njiru police station. The couple and neighbouring Njiru residents say Gitau was arrested alongside a woman who was later released. She is the one who reported the arrest to the parents. “Gitau left his parents' home in Njiru at around 7pm on the fateful day and efforts by his parents to trace him have been fruitless,” a resident said. The couple and residents on Monday accused the police of profiling innocent youths. They claimed some of their teenage children were targeted and gunned down for allegedly being criminals. They said that Gitau was not a criminal and should be produced dead or alive. “I taught Gitau in ECD, I know him as a good and humble man. We want police to tell us where he is,” a Mwalimu Wangui said. Kayole subcounty police commander Wilson Kosgei said, “There were some young men who held demonstrations over the claims yesterday. I was not aware of any missing person until they demonstrated.”
