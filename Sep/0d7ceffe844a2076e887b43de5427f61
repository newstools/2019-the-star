The health workers strike that was to start this Friday in Vihiga has been suspended after successful negotiations led by Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi. Saisi said the county is committed to ensure that health services are not crippled. Kenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN) chair Zadock Miheso on Thursday morning told the Star that Saisi has assured them that all their demands will be met. Health workers are seeking the harmonisation of salaries. Miheso said that erroneous deductions from their salaries was another case that the county has not addressed. “As workers within the county, we also request promotions be done in the health sector,” Miheso said. Saisi while speaking to the Star on the phone, said a number of issues the health workers have raised are genuine. “The SRC issues that they arising will be implemented under the supplementary budget,” he said. "We are doing this because we are giving health priority."
