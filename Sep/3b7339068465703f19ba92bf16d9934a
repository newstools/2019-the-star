Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro has been released after spending a night in police custody. Murang'a Senator Irungu Kangata on Tuesday morning said he had secured Nyoro's release. Kangata said the MP is currently at his home and that no charges will be preferred against him. "We have been able to use our legal acumen to secure his unconditional release. There is no evidence against my good friend Nyoro and therefore there is no reason to warrant his arrest and his arraignment in court," the Senator said on Citizen TV. Kangata dismissed reports that Nyoro had gone into hiding before his arrest. Anti-riot police were deployed in Murang'a on Monday night after residents took to the streets to protest the arrest of Nyoro. Residents lit bonfires after then MP was arrested over a fracas caused at a church on Sunday prompting police officers to lob teargas canisters to disperse protesters. The protesters said it is unfair for the police to arrest Ndindi alone yet the scuffle was caused by his disagreement with nominated MP Maina Kamanda. The protesters vowed to continue with the demo until the MP is released. Nyoro was arrested at ACK St James Cathedral where he was attending a show, alongside other MPs, hosted by Kameme TV. Immediately he arrived at the venue at 7.40pm, anti-riot police officers attempted to arrest him, but after negotiating with the producers, they agreed to wait until after the show. At 9 pm, Nyoro was arrested and taken to Murang'a police station.
