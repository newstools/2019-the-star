Agnes Odhiambo, who was sworn in as Kenyaâ€™s first Controller of Budget on August 27, 2011, exited the stage after an eight-year stint at the helm of the independent office. The state employment agency invited applications for the highly coveted office by September 9. Qualifications for the position include being a Kenyan citizen with extensive knowledge of public finance or at least 10 years' experience in auditing public finance management.
