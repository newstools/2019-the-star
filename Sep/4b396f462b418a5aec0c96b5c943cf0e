 Maweni villagers in Manda, Lamu West, have been forced to stay indoors to avoid being attacked by three lions that are killing their livestock. The villagers have been tormented by the marauding beasts for the last three weeks despite reporting their woes to the Kenya Wildlife Service. Ten goats and two donkeys have been killed by the lions. Subchief Bernard Nyachae said they had been advised by the KWS to limit movements and remain indoors. Schools reopened on Monday and children are unlikely to attend classes. The islanders, who are mainly stone cutters can no longer venture into the quarries since most mines in the lion-infested bushes. “We first saw them two weeks ago after they killed 10 goats. Many people have seen or encountered them. Our children can’t go to school. Life has become unbearable,” Nyachae said. Manda villagers have also to deal with deadly snakes. “The KWS has deliberately refused to help us. Initially, it was snakes and now lions. They lie to the media that they are sending help but they don’t do anything," Johnson Kamau said. Senior KWS warden Mathias Mwavita confirmed that three lions are on the loose. He said the lions swam across the Indian Ocean from their habitat in Boni-Dodori reserve during low tide. He said rangers had been dispatched to the village to immobilise the lions and return them to the reserve.
