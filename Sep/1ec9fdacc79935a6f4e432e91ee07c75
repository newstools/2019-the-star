Canada winger Jeff Hassler took a year off professional rugby to drink in life and assess his options but should prove crucial to his side’s chances of beating Italy in their Pool B World Cup opener in Fukuoka today. The 28-year-old Hassler has been paired with the prolific DTH van der Merwe on the wings at Fukuoka Hakatonomori Stadium, with the winner of the game likely to finish third in the pool and qualify automatically for the next tournament in France. World rugby heavyweights New Zealand and South Africa are also in Pool B and, short of several upsets of the scale of Japan beating the Springboks four years ago in England, the two should ease into the quarter-finals. Hassler’s combination with the South African-born Van der Merwe, who is appearing in his fourth World Cup and has carved out a strong professional career in Britain, most prominently with the Glasgow Warriors, should prove crucial. “These two are playing in top leagues and they know how to score tries,” Italy winger Matteo Minozzi said of the pacey Canadian duo on Wednesday. “They are quick and powerful, and we must make sure we keep maximum attention on them.” Hassler played for five seasons with Ospreys in the Pro14 but unexpectedly quit at the end of the 2018 season thinking he might take some time away from the game.
