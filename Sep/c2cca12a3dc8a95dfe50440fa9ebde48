The Corporate Bookers Cocktail on Thursday hosted company bookers to appreciate them for their support throughout the year, as well as give them a platform to network. The event was the first one organised by the three Accor hotel brands in Kenya: Mövenpick Hotel & Residences Nairobi, Fairmont and Ibis. Mövenpick is the latest acquisition by Accor in the country.
