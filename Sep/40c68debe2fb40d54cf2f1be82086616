Migori county travellers have been forced to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for transport as school reopen for the third term. From Monday when students started heading back to school, fares have been hiked almost threefold. From Migori to Rongo town, travellers had to pay Sh400, from the usual Sh150. Tom Opere said he had to stop travelling to Kisii from Monday to Tuesday as conductors had been taken advantage of the upsurge in demand. "Matatu operators have taken advantage of the school reopening. Students have also been stranded. Even fares to Nairobi have shot up to the roof,” Opere said. Florence Ochieng, a parent, said she was forced to hire a taxi to take her three children to school. “I waited for hours and each time conductors increased the fare, forcing me to pick a taxi, which was cheaper as the three were headed to the same direction,” she said. But Migori Matatu Operators’ Union chairman Rarieda rejected the claim, calling on affected passengers to report the issue to the officers manning roadblocks. “We have not increased the fare, but we know we have rogue members. It is illegal,” he said. "Those who are travelling are our children, brothers and sisters, some are our parents. Why should we increase the transportation fee?” Rarieda said the only thing that can lead to an increase in fare is when fuel price is hiked.
