Remind your mothers and grandmothers on the old notes deadline, CBK governor Patrick Njoroge has warned. “Our mothers and grandmothers are epic savers. They may have some money around their homes,” he said on Wednesday via Twitter. “Please check on them and remind them of the deadline of September 30 for exchanging the older Sh 1000 notes.” After September 30, all older generation notes will be absolutely worthless. Last week, the Central Bank of Kenya said there are enough new generation notes in circulation, urging Kenyans to take advantage of the deadline to replace old notes. About 100 million pieces of the old Sh1,000 note had been returned to the CBK by end of August ahead of September 30 deadline. This translates to about 50 per cent of old Sh1,000 in circulation, meaning members of the public have less than a month to return remaining 117 million pieces of old notes which will be obsolete come October 1.
