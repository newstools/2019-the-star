Former Football Kenya Federation President Sam Nyamweya is contemplating running for the top seat in the forthcoming elections. Nyamweya, who has been in the cold for the last three years, failed to defend his seat in 2016 where Nick Mwendwa emerged the winner. With the Annual General Meeting and the polls pencilled for the end of the year, Nyamweya who has been a fierce critic of the current regime and has not shied from showing his intentions of recapturing the seat. Nyamweya claimed that Kenyan football was on its knees and needs redemption. "In view of the passionate appeal and in an effort to redeem the beautiful game from imminent collapse, I am deeply considering the requests of the stakeholders who I have been in communication with. I am soon going to make an announcement on my position on the way forward,” he said. He added: “I have been inundated by calls and visits by delegations of principal football stakeholders, drawn from different parts of  the country to seek my wise counsel, and request to offer leadership and direction on the management of the beautiful game and its future growth.” Nyamweya was elected the FKF president in 2011 but withdrew from the last polls at stoppage time leaving the incumbent Mwendwa, Semi Aina and long-serving Gor Mahia chairman Ambrose Rachier to muscle for the seat.
