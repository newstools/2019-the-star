The Local Organizing Committee for the 2019 edition of County Assemblies’ Sports Association (CASA) has dropped half marathon from their schedule of events. Instead, members drawn from the assemblies will compete in the 5k fun and the corporate race at the Eldoret Sports Club on October 5. “I want to clarify that there will be no half marathon as it has been reported. As the vice-chair, no athlete who is not a member of the County Assembly will be allowed to run,” said Leah Malot who serves as the Local Organizing Committee (LOC) vice-chairperson. Malot is a 1999 All Africa Games 10,000m bronze medalist. She said golf is the latest inclusion in the event. “We are widening the net and attracting more sporting events in the championships,” said CASA's secretary-general Bernard Omboko Uasin Gishu's county clerk Shadrack Choge said the championships will be great for the county that won the title and they are confident of defending it fully. Usain Gishu, who are the overall defending champions will enjoy home advantage in their quest to retain their title. “ We must ensure that we get the best results of all time. If we won away,  then what will stop us from winning at home,” said Choge
