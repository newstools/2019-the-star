The Kenya High Commission to South Africa has confirmed a number of Kenyans have been affected by the xenophobic attacks in South Africa. In a statement, Kenya's High Commissioner to South Africa Amb. Jean Kamau said that they have reached out to the affected individuals. "The Kenya High Commission has noted with great concern that several Kenyan citizens have been affected by the recent spate of violence through arson and physical violence as well as reported incidences of looting in various sections of Gauteng province," she said. "We have encouraged them to respond to the instructions and calls by the South African police to report and open files regarding all the incidences." She cautioned Kenyans to ensure that they work with their local diaspora leaders to monitor the situation and take measures to safeguard their security. "All must remain vigilant and aware of their environment," the high commissioner added. The High Commission remains open as usual for Kenyan citizens to report incidences and seek advice. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday condemned a wave of looting and violence that has mostly targeted foreign nationals. "There can be no justification for any South African to attack people from other countries," he said. The African Union (AU) issued a statement condemning the "despicable acts" of violence "in the strongest terms". Police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades in an attempt to quell the unrest on Monday. The surge in violence also saw mobs target lorries that were being driven by foreign nationals. Violence continued on Tuesday in Johannesburg's Alexandra township.
