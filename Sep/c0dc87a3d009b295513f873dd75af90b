Serena Hotel Nairobi on Friday played host to an underwater photographic exhibition by Jahawi Bertolli, an event organised by Lisa Christoffersen. Over the evening, guests enjoyed a three-course dinner and the opportunity to win exciting prizes in a raffle, an amazing auction that included a collaboration between Jahawi and world-renowned artist Anthony Russell, and a little retail therapy. The venue was used to fundraise for 'Call of the Humpbacks', a film aiming to raise awareness, help conserve and protect these incredible gentle giants. The MC was Pinky Ghelani. Entertainment was offered by a live musical performance by Gilad and the Superband.
