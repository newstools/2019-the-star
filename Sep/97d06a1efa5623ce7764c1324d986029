Nairobi Queens women's team coach Jack Ochieng has admitted that they do not have the necessary competition even as they seek to retain the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) national league title. The champions humiliated National Youth Service 54-10 as the league entered second round at the Kaloleni grounds over the weekend. Ochieng said healthy and worthy competitors make the league more interesting and fun. He said: “Not being challenged for the title that we have won back-to-back in a way makes the team comfortable and the league dull. But in as much as it's good that we have been winning the title for quite some time now, it's more fulfilling if you are made to sweat en-route winning the title," He added: “The league has just kicked off and there are new teams on board and that's good. However, I hope this season will be more competitive. Either way, we are keen on retaining the title at the end of the season.” At the same time, newcomers rising Starlet continued with their good run in the league after recording two wins against NYS and Mt Kenya University -Thika. Starlet won against NYS 51-26 on Saturday before guarding their unbeaten run with a 37-27 win against MKU. Other women's result saw National Cereals and Produce Board overpower MKU 37-16. In the men's category, NCPB continued with their good run after seeing off Kenyatta University (22-19) and MKU 35-12. Strathmore University reigned supreme against NYS 41-18 before former champions Black Mamba overwhelmed Warriors 67-11.
