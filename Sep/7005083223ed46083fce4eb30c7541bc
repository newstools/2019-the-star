A mother and her child who drowned in their car at the Likoni Ferry channel have been identified. Mariam Kigenda, 35, and her four-year-old daughter died after their car slid from the rear of MV Harambee just before it docked on the Island side. The minor was a student at MM Shah, with the school authorities confirming they had lost one of them, through a text sent to parents. On Monday, Mariam's husband and other family members camped at the ferry early in the morning to monitor rescue operations. But by the time of going to the press, police were still waiting for Kenya Navy rescue services and other private divers. The Star learned that the Kenya Ferry top brass were holed up in an emergency meeting over the incident. Likoni OCPD Benjamin Rotich said that the vehicle lost breaks and reversed just before the ferry docked. The car, a Toyota ISIS registration number KCB 289C was onboard MV Harambee and was plying to the Island side. He said that ferry officials attempted to throw out rescue savers near the car, but the two were trapped inside the car and could not access them.
