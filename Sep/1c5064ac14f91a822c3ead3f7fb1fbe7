Claims by Marianne Kitany that she built a house for Meru Senator Mithika Linturi may have contributed to his father’s death, a Nairobi court heard on Tuesday. Linturi told Milimani chief magistrate Peter Gesoro that the divorce proceedings had a negative impact on his father, who died on Monday evening. “My client’s father was unhappy because of the scandalous allegations that Kitany made. He has been in a weak state of mind when he learned that a woman crossed boundaries to go build his son a house yet he has able sons and is a member of Njuri Ncheke,” Linturi’s lawyer Muthomi Thiankolu said. The hearing was put off until today. While Linturi was ready to proceed, notwithstanding his father's demise, Kitany sought adjournment through lawyer Danstan Omari to mourn her father-in-law. She was not in court. “My client is in the process of going to her home in Meru to be part of her father-in-law's burial programme. She is not competent to proceed with the case after facing such a 'massive death blow,'” Omari said. He added, "I have instructions from Kitany to pass her sincere condolences to her husband Linturi and to the whole Igembe community for the loss." The lawyer asked the court to give different dates for the hearing. But Linturi, through Muthomi, said: "Kitany should not cry louder than the bereaved". The lawyer said he had consulted Linturi on whether to proceed and his instructions were that "we should proceed.  It’s never the counsel’s case." Muthomi said there are many aspects of Linturi's life in abeyance pending the outcome of the divorce case. Omari, in a brief rejoinder, said it is "un-African" for Linturi to say he is ready to proceed despite his father’s demise. “Marianne has a right to be heard when she is emotionally stable to present her case. If Linturi insists it proceeds, let’s come back on Friday,” he said. Gesoro directed that the case proceeds today from 8am.
