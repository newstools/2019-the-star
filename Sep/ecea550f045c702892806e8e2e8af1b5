 Over 8,000 girls aged 10 years will be vaccinated against cervical cancer in Laikipia next month. County vaccines coordinator Michael Kinga said that they had completed mapping the vast county ahead of the exercise. “We are currently carrying out sensitisation on the importance of young girls getting the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine that prevents over 70 per cent of women from developing cancer of the cervix,” Kinga said on Wednesday at Nanyuki Teaching and Referral Hospital. The 10-year-olds are targeted because they are not sexually active. The jabs will give them immunity cancer of the cervix. The girls will be injected on the upper part of the arm at six months intervals to ensure efficacy. The countrywide exercise is being rolled out amid protests and calls for its rejection from the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association (KCDA). The doctors say HPV is sexually transmitted and the best way to control its spread is by sexual discipline. KCDA last month called for the rejection of the HPV vaccine, citing numerous side effects, among them premature ovarian failure, premature menopause and death in some cases. Chairman Stephen Karanja argued that “our considered advice is that all Kenyans should reject HPV vaccination.” Kinga told the meeting that the vaccination will be cost-free. It will be conducted in all public health facilities as well as in primary schools. “The government has no moral authority to harm its people. I wonder why some people are opposed to such a noble exercise to rid our women of cervical cancer,” he said. The girls will be issued with immunisation cards as part of their health records and proof that they are vaccinated.
