The labour Ministry is set to spend Sh211 billion to implement its five year Strategic plan on Social protection. Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yattani on Thursday said the five year plan will see implementation of four key areas of best labour practices, employment and promotion of productivity, leadership and integrity and policy coordination and capacity building. Yattani said there is however need for more donors to come on board to help in funding the robust 2018/2022 plan. According to him, the government has committed some Sh162 billion towards the plan but will depend on donors to raise the remaining Sh49 billion. "The Strategic Plan is a blueprint the ministry will use to solve some of the challenges identified," he said. Yattani said high unemployment levels especially among the youth and women, weak institutional capacity and  a mismatch between the number if graduates and job demand had greatly affected the implementation of the 2013/17 strategic plan. He said inadequate policy, legal and institutional frameworks, lack of a comprehensive wages and remuneration policy and  low workforce productivity were some of the challenges the ministry is grappling with to implement the plan. With regards to the Inua Jamii program, Yattani said the government is now monitoring data of all the 1.2 million beneficiaries. "We are now able to monitor where they are, who has received what amount of money and when," he said. He said the ministry spends about Sh27 billion annually to fund the program. This is a significant increase as compared to Sh6 billion when the program was launched in 2013.
