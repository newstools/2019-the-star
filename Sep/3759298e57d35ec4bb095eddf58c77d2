The national government has launched an innovation program to empower youths, fight against corruption and drug trafficking in the country. The project entails use of science and technology for entrepreneurship and is being implemented by the Office of the President. Under the program, the youth will undergo training to report corrupt officials and drug cartels. Mukhtar Ogle, secretary of strategic initiatives in the Cabinet Affairs Office, said their aim is to actualise selection of President Uhuru Kenyatta as the global champion for youth. Ogle made the revelation during the launch of the program in Kilifi, which brought together more than 25 youth recruited as leaders. “We are looking for our young people, what they can do in their respective communities and explore the place of science and technology and innovation for them to engage in sustainable and productive entrepreneurship,” he said. He said they want to use the network of youths to be at the forefront in the fight against corruption. Ogle said they want young people to be whistleblowers in their counties to hold their leaders accountable. “The fight against corruption is everybody’s fight. For us to secure our future and the future of our young people, I think young people have to take a clue from the operating institutions that are very active in working in the fight against corruption and drugs," he said. He said the current war against corruption and drugs should inspire young men and women to come forward and report the ruinous vices in the community.
