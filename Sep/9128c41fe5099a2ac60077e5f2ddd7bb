Wines and spirits manufacturer London Distillers Kenya has challenged a decision by Mavoko Water and Sewerage Company to disconnect its sewer line in Athi River. The company wants the court to restrain MWSC and Machakos county government from interfering with their sewer lines until the case is determined. London Distillers argues that MWSC without reason and with ulterior motives vandalized their sewer line connecting it to the EPZA main trunk line. The company alleges the water firm filled its manhole with premixed concrete forcing it to shut down its distillery as it is unable to discharge effluent. Last week, MWSC disconnected LDKs sewer line accusing them of discharging harmful effluent and polluting Athi River. They argue the act was illegal and an abuse of court process as MWSC had no mandate to prematurely bar them from discharging effluent into the EPZ main line. They say they have never polluted the environment as alleged. Further, they want the OCS Mavoko police station to be directed to provide security for their employees while they remove the blockages to their sewer line and replace vandalised pipes and manholes.
