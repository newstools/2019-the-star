Nick Ruto, Deputy President William Ruto’s eldest son, on Sunday asked leaders to trust the youth. Likewise, the youth should trust leaders, Ruto junior said during a tour of Mombasa in the company of businessman-cum-politician Mohamed Abdalla, who is said to be eyeing the Jomvu MP seat in 2022. Nick, in what observers say is his bid to cut his political teeth, told the youth, “The people in leadership will trust us and empower us if we show they can trust us.” He said the youth can change the country’s fortunes if they are empowered and guided on how to get focused in life. He said sports was a straightforward way to help youth focus their energies on positive things. “Sports is the new drug. All youth, wherever they are in Kenya, should come out and participate in such events,” the 30-year-old businessman and lawyer said. He is said to be interested in the Turbo parliamentary seat in 2022, hence his early bid to woo the youth. The area was once represented by his father. Nick urged the government to support the initiatives of individuals and organisations to help the youth so that they are not tempted to engage in drugs and crime. He spoke at Kwa Jomvu Primary School during the Mohamed CPK Cup, a volleyball tourney sponsored by Abdalla. Abdalla, the Crown Petroleum Kenya boss, said many youths under 30 years are dying due to drugs and drug-related crimes. He said the youth can transform Kenya if they were properly guided. “That is where corporates should come in," he said citing an initiative like tackling the garbage crisis in Mombasa.
