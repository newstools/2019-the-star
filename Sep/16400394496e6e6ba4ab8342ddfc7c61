Police have recovered the items stolen last month from Kitutu Chache North MP Jimmy Angwenyi's house. Rioma subcounty police boss Hillary Tarus said a 42 inch TV, curtains and some kitchenware were recovered from a person who had bought them from the burglars. "They were sold for Sh10,000 to him. The recovered items are in our custody at the police station," Tarus told the Star by phone. He, however, said the primary suspect, a former farmworker said to have in his possession keys to the MP's house,Â  is still at large. "We are still on his trail and we urge him to surrender to the police station nearest to him before the law catches up with him," said the police boss said. Two guards have since been prosecuted. Separately, two children at Kegogi in the same Kisii subcounty are in custody after they were found with Sh100,000. Tarus said the police are investigating a Saturday break-in into a shop where the money was stolen. The money was in a sack, he said. "We have sent officers from the DCI to probe the incident so that we can get a full brief of what the children were up to," Tarus told the Star by phone. The shop owner was away for church service. A villager said the children are notorious burglars in the shopping centre and neighbouring villages.
