Kenya national scrabble tournament this weekend at Farm View Hotel in Busia has attracted players from as far as Uganda. SK chairman Bernard Amuke said the border town will offer an opportunity to players from Uganda to compete for the title. Ugandan Philip Edwin Mugisha has in the recent past given Kenyans a run for their money and won Kisumu title a year ago. He also led Ugandans to the 2018 Africa Scrabble Championships. Amuke said with the proximity to the border, he expects the neighbouring players to turn up in large numbers. With top Kenyan players already in the national team ahead of World English Scrabble Players Association Championships (WESPAC), the two-day event will be part of their build-up to sharpen their skills ahead of next monthâ€™s championships in Goa, India. "The Busia event will be the second in the Western Conference after Bondo and so we expect some good numbers. The event will also serve as a build-up for the Youth Cup and WESPAC respectively. Those playing the Inter-banks and CASA games will also have an opportunity to play before their annual sports festivals." said Amuke. Eighteen games will be played over the 2 days in the Intermediate and Premier divisions while 16 games will be played in the Open.
