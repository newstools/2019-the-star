The destruction of telecommunications masts by al Shabaab in Northeastern Kenya is taking a toll on residents. Safaricom, the main communication service provider, has lost numerous masts after attacks by Shabaab militants along the border. Masts in Welmarer, Amuma, Yumbis, Hulugho, Jabibar and Galmagala in Garissa have all been destroyed. Mandera county has not been spared as several masts along the border have been brought down. Services such as M-Pesa mobile money transfer provided by Safaricom have been completely cut off and communities along the border continue to suffer. Areas without communications coverage are vulnerable to attacks and calling for help is impossible. Mohamed Abdi, a resident of Yumbis in Garissa's Fafi subcounty, said the security apparatus has not been keen on securing the masts. The mast in Yumbis was brought down in June. “When these militants bring down the communication masts, I  assure you that it's the residents who suffer the most because we are forced to trek for kilometres to get to the nearest booster either to communicate, withdraw or send money,” he said. Ijara MP Sophia Abdi Noor said a large section of her constituency has been hurt by the destructions that has undermined the economy. Lack of communications has far-reaching effects on the community, especially poorer individuals and households receiving aid from relatives abroad, making it far harder to survive, she said. Noor said, “Uninterrupted communication is a catalyst for development. The private sector such as Safaricom invests in masts to support antenna for telecommunication and it's our duty to ensure the security of these services.” Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamed Birik in a separate interview said the government has intensified security across the region. He said police stations have been established at the vital installations to guard the masts. Edited by R.Wamochie
