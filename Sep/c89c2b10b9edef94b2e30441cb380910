Chama Cha Mashinani party has publicly denounced the Punguza Mizigo bill, saying Kenyans have no problem with representation. Party leader Isaac Rutto instead said he fully supports the Building Bridges Initiative and the call for more funds to counties as proposed by the governors in their Ugatuzi initiative. Rutto said Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot's intention was in bad taste "hence Kenyans should totally reject the bill". He said the coming together of President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga has been beneficial for the unity in the country. The party leader, who spoke during a church service at Sugurusiek Catholic Church on Sunday, said there was nothing wrong with having many elected leaders as Kenyans need services closer to them. "In fact, we still need to split some regions to have more so that we can create more jobs and even if they are just there and earning there is nothing wrong," he said. The former Bomet governor, however, said BBI and the recently launched Ugatuzi should be merged, saying both seek to address the issues faced by Kenyans. He pointed out that there was a need to unite all Kenyans to eradicate the ever-occurring animosity between some communities after every election. "Let us build bridges between communities of Kenya, let there be peace in the country. We cannot be fighting after each election. We want to bury these tribal differences and live as Kenyans."
