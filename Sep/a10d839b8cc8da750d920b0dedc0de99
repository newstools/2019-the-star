Top autocross riders Sameer Verjee and Kunal Patel are among entries who have confirmed participation in the Chloride Exide-sponsored Hill Climb competition planned for September 21/22 at the Malewa Bay venue on the outskirts of Naivasha. Apart from Patel (buggy) and Manji (Classic 2WD), the rest of the entrants include Tim Jessop (buggy), Rajveer Thethy (buggy), Sayanna Jessop (buggy), Mark Glen (bike), Wayne Fernandes (quad), Yuvraj Rajput (buggy) and Kirit Rajput (4WD) among others. Event director, Daven Jadeja said they expect more entries ahead of the event. He said the competitors will test their skills on the 3km stretch to try and achieve the highest speeds on the uphill stretch. The 3km stretch starts from the bottom of a hill at 1900 metres to the top at 2200 metres and will test the drivers’ abilities to see who can drive fastest uphill on a course with a mixture of sharp bend and corners. The Hill Climb event dubbed as ‘The Powerlast’ Hill Climb, has attracted machines varying from ordinary rally cars to buggies and motorcycles. Jadeja explained that Hill Climb is a unique sport, which enables each car and driver to set the quickest time up the steep hills. The organisers are also emphasising on safety and at hand will be a full medical team headed by Dr. Raj Jutley, who was the chief medical officer during this year’s Safari Rally. He will have the backing of two ambulances, two paramedics and a fast response Medical Intervention Vehicle (MIV). Dr. Jutley is a cardiothoracic surgeon who has been in motorsport for many years serving in both UK and now in Kenya, where he was born. He is also an active competitor in the South African National Rally Championship where he is leading the Classic Class as a navigator.
