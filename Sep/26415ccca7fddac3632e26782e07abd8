Strathmore University registered their third win of the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) Premier League season courtesy of a 2-1 victory over Wazalendo as coach Meshack Senge urged his charges to be sharp before the goal. The students have been struggling for consistency but goals from Job Ogesa (30th minute) and Davies Apari (41st) was all the Gladiators needed to beat their rivals, who pulled a consolation in the 50th minute through Eric Ochieng. Senge also reiterated the need for his new side to show maturity having lost nine players last season. He said: “We needed this win more than them. We created chances and we could not convert them.” “We are struggling because I lost nine players to rival teams in the league and I am now building on a young side. We need to be patient. For now, we need to finish the season strongly.” His counterpart Fidelis Kimanzi blamed the loss on midweek matches but remained optimistic of winning the next match. “Playing three games in eight days has taken a toll on us. You could see they looked fresh and we were a bit sluggish. Three points will be a priority in our next match,” he said. Following the victory, Strathmore now have 10 points.
