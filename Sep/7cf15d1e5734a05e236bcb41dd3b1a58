Workers of Murang’a Water and Sanitation Company who were allegedly assaulted by county officials have vowed to appeal the case that was dismissed by a magistrate’s court. The four workers, through their advocate Kiroko Ndegwa, said they were not satisfied with the ruling that acquitted the suspects. They accuse Water executive Paul Macharia together with three others of assaulting them on August 27 last year. But on Wednesday, resident magistrate Sheila Nyaga said the county officials have no case to answer after the prosecution failed to produce concrete evidence. Nyaga acquitted Macharia and Samuel Mwangi, Nicholas Ndegwa and Stephen Chege, saying the evidence produced before her was not corroborated. The ruling set them free a year after they were charged with assault and destruction of property at Kiawambeu Water Treatment plant during the failed takeover of Muwasco management by the county. Ndegwa said his clients’ rights were violated as they were assaulted while they were in the line of duty and by people they knew. He noted that their move to lodge an appeal is informed by the fact that the lower court declined to have prosecution adduce new evidence. “As the case proceeded, we were not allowed to bring new evidence and we have opted to appeal the case after the accused were acquitted,” Ndegwa said. “During the proceedings, I was denied a chance to introduce fresh evidence including videos, despite being allowed by the law." One of the complainants, Margaret Wairimu, recounted the pain she went through after she was attacked by people known to her. “We will appeal the court ruling as we feel justice was not served and the court failed to defend the innocent from being bullied around by known persons,” Wairimu said during a press briefing on Sunday. In her ruling, the magistrate stated that there was a variance of evidence by the witnesses on accounts of what transpired on August 27 last year. Edited by R.Wamochie
