Embu town residents have accused security agencies of failing to contain crime in the area. They say they are living in fear of losing property and life as gangs continue to terrorise them. They said criminals have been stealing household items, raping and killing women. "Two women in Embu town have been found murdered and their bodies dumped in rivers," a resident said. Further, residents said the level of insecurity in Embu is alarming and robbers are stealing even during the day. "On Thursday last week, my house in Bluevalley was swept clean of all the electronics in broad daylight," Felix Muriuki said. He said a colleague's vehicle was broken into near Embu Level 5 Hospital and a laptop stolen. Further, a woman was robbed of money in Bluevalley and a motorbike was stolen in Kangaru on Saturday, Muriuki said. "It seems like nobody really cares," a Majengo estate resident said. However, police officers in the region have denied that cases of insecurity have gone up. Embu West subcounty commander Julius Meli said those affected do not report to the police. "Security has been enhanced and residents should stop making allegations that are not true," Meli said.
