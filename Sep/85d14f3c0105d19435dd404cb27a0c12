@Waithaka06 The corporate style of management at the Laikipia county government has helped increase revenue collection in the last two years, Governor Ndiritu Muriithi has said. Muriithi on Thursday said he, his deputy and most of his county executives have served in various positions in the corporate world and have continued to employ management practices that corporations use. The governor cited the release of quarterly financial statements by the county government, automation of revenue collection systems and regular engagement with taxpayers as factors that have led to an increase in revenue. Speaking in his Nanyuki town office during the launch of county financial statements for the year ending June 30, 2019, the governor said his administration had registered a 35 per cent growth in revenue collection for 2018-19. He said Sh819 million was collected in the period compared to Sh608 million in the previous year. “The revenue rose by Sh211 million more from the previous year,” Muriithi said. He said the revenue stream had continued to grow without increasing additional taxes but was driven by increased awareness that paying the requisite rates was crucial to improved services. “Revenue streams that have shown tremendous improvement include land rates at 143 per cent, county natural resources at 82 per cent, technical services at 68 per cent, slaughter fees at 34 per cent, parking fees at 31 per cent, market and trade fees at 31 per cent and hospital fees at 20 per cent,” he added. The governor said as a result of improved revenue collection, more development projects such as grading of access roads, construction of classrooms, drilling of boreholes and issuance of bursaries had been rolled out in all the 15 wards.
