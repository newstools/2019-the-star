Comedian Njugush and his wife Celestine have opened up on who their celebrity crushes are. "My celebrity crush is Avril," Njugush said in a YouTube live session. Celestine sent a shoutout to the 'Chokoza' hitmaker, saying her husband is seriously crushing on him. "Avril, we need to hook up and I don't have a problem but yours is serious, we can be 'boyz'." Njugush then said that his wife loves Willy Paul and Nyashinski, and it hurts him. "She does not hide it from me," he said. Celestine defended herself, saying she has feelings and a heart despite being married. "Me loving you does not mean that I can't love someone else," she said. She said she loves Willy Paul's music but Nyashinski has good music and he looks hot.
