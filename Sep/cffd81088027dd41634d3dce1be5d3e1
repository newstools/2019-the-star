Manyatta MP John Muchiri has called for a fresh distribution of the Mwea settlement scheme land. He wants the 2016 distribution of 7,232 parcels done away with and allocation done afresh. But Mbeere South MP Geoffrey King'ang'i has been opposing the fresh distribution of the 44,000 acres. He wants the 2016 allocation to remain the way it was. He, however, wants an additional 2,000 people given land, arguing they were left behind in the distribution. The scheme is in Mbeere South constituency. King'ang'iâ€™s stand has been causing disaffection with the settlers, who claim that most of the 7,232 people who were allocated the land are outsiders. Muchiri on Sunday said people who have lived on the scheme since 1970s should be given priority while allocating the land. He spoke during a fundraiser at Kitololoni Catholic Parish in Mbeere South Subcounty. The MP said the land would be more productive if irrigation water was provided. The distribution and settlement of persons on the land was stopped in April 2018 after nine settlers were critically injured by police. The nine were shot by police after settlers tried to block 1,732 people who had been allocated land in the scheme. Settlers claimed most of them were outsiders.
