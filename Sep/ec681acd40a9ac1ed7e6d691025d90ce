Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has said the government will prioritise the sustenance of security and repression of marauding criminals in Kiambu county. Matiang’i announced that reorganisation of security and national government administration in the county has begun to address administrative challenges that have compromised security operations. He spoke on Thursday in Gatundu, where he met leaders from the area. Matiang'i decried rising cases of defilement, robbery with violence and burglary in the area. The CS said that more police officers will be deployed to the region to intensify an operation targeting hot spots of these crimes. “It is our job to be awake at night so that wananchi sleep peacefully. We are going to comb this place, and we will be hard on these criminals,”Matiang'i said. He also challenged security teams in the region to be proactive and demonstrate readiness to exercise the government’s basic responsibility, which is protecting the lives and property of citizens. "The government will not tolerate any form of criminal activity. In collaboration with security organs, we'll work towards the sustenance of security and repression of any form of crime in Kiambu," Matiang'i said. He was accompanied by Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai, Kiambu Deputy Governor James Nyoro, area MP Moses Kuria and Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni wa Muchomba. The crime wave in Kiambu forced the police on May to cluster the county into three to monitor security. Kiambu county police commander Ali Nunow had said that the operation will help the officers to boost the investigations, response and apprehension of criminals. "These clusters will run normal operations of the police but will have joint patrols, assist each other in investigations and in so doing, we shall reduce crime," Nunow said.
