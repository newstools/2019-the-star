Limuru residents on Thursday rejected the Punguza Mizigo bill. Members of Kiambu county assembly had a difficult time controlling residents during a public participation event. The bill seeks to amend the 2010 Constitution. In less than an hour after the participation started, members of the public had unanimously agreed to reject the bill and asked a pastor to pray to end the meeting. They claim the bill is aimed at killing the gains achieved by the 2010 Constitution. "We have asked the MCAs to reject the bill when it will be introduced in their assembly. If they discuss it, they will not be representing our views," businessman David Macharia said. Macharia said Thirdway Alliance leader Ekuru Aukot and his team did not involve the public, leaders or opinion leaders. He said the bill represents his proposal, not other people's feelings. MCA's led by the assembly majority leader Gideon Gachara, chairman of the legal committee Ivyone Waweru and MCAs Ngige Karuga (Limuru East), Jacque Nungari (Bibirioni), Antony Ikonya (Kiambu Town), Hezron Gachui (Riabai) and Nduta Muongi (nominated) were forced to end the meeting held at the county offices in Limuru town. Gachara said residents only asked them to extract some important and useful articles that would help the public in making amendments to the Constitution in the future. The majority leader applauded residents for voicing their views. Muongi said the bill is confusing since it demeans some gains made by the current Constitution, such as the creation of constituencies and wards. "People are being told one side of the wage bill," Muongi said. Muongi urged residents to wait for the Building Bridges Initiative bill so that they can discuss it and see if it will be favourable for the country. "I'm so overwhelmed by how people spoke without fear about why we should reject this document. Let us now wait for the BBI bill and see what people will also say," she said.
