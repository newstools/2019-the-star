World Rally Championship (WRC) Safari Rally Project CEO Phineas Kimathi is optimistic Kenya will be readmitted to the apex of the sport despite the anticipated delay in announcing the 2020 calendar by the world governing body, FIA. Speaking during the prize-giving of the KCB national autocross 9 at Kasarani racetrack, Kimathi noted that the Safari which was dropped from the WRC calendar in 2002, is in a safe place. “I have just returned from Geneva where we had a series of meetings and I can assure you that Safari is in a safe place,” said Kimathi, who is also the chairman of the Kenya Motor Sports Federation. The government-backed WRC Project based in Kasarani has introduced two years ago in a bid to help the country regain its lost global status. Over the weekend, the FIA President Jean Todt was quoted as saying that the FIA may delay the release of the 2020 World Rally Championship calendar. Todt, during a media briefing at the Asparan Service Park of WRC Turkey, said the FIA is still weighing options after numerous requests from potential host countries. The 2020 calendar is scheduled to be released in October.
