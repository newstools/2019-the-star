Residents of Makande estate have expressed hope the refurbishment of their sewer lines, which have been abandoned for years, will change their lives. The residents have for long complained of unfavourable conditions due to blockage of sewer lines which have been stinking up the estate and putting them at risk of infections. Speaking to the Star at her residence, Fatuma Hassan, who has lived there for about 30 years, says the situation gets when it rains. “The sewage enters the houses,” she said. The National Housing Corporation has embarked on major rehabilitation of the sewer lines. It will also build three 90,000-litre septic tanks with associated pipelines and three soak pits. NHC has also confirmed the blockages have been caused by constructions of kiosks and structures on top of the sewer lines by private developers. Said Bakari said those structures have been a menace "but the owners say they have a right to stay on those lands as they have permission". The residents also complain that the people who have built the structures are not residents, citing insecurity. In a statement, NHC managing director Andrew Saisi said legal action will be taken against the developers. Saisi said they will be evicted for rehabilitation to be successful. But even after the move by NHC to renovate sewer lines, residents say they still grapple with problems of water shortage. Bakari said the estate has not had water for five years now. Garbage collection has also been a problem with heaps lying on the streets of the estate, the resident said. He added, “This is not an estate, it lacks a perimeter wall; it is not gated, there are no parking lots or a playing ground for kids. An estate is usually better organised." Edited by R.Wamochie
