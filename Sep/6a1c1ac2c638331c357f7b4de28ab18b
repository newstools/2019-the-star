'Real Househelps of Kawangware' star Winnie Rubi, popularly known as Awiti, says the first time she cried over a man was when she found out he was cheating on her. Awiti says she had just given birth. Speaking on YouTube, Awiti said although she did everything she thought was necessary as a wife then, her man still cheated on her. "The first time my baby daddy cheated was when my baby was a few months old," she said. Awiti says all through she had avoided checking his phone. "Then one day, I went to breastfeed my baby in the bedroom and he was in the bathroom," she said. "His phone rang and a message popped and I decided to check. The message was from a lady he had sent cash to come from Eldoret and meet him." She broke up with him soon afterwards.
