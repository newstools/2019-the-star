Kilili Baharini Resort on Saturday hosted an all-white party organised by Akothee, reportedly Kenya's richest singer. The event, attended by Italian tycoons, aimed to support the Akothee Foundation, which was formed to support the disadvantaged in Turkana. It also marked the 60th birthday party of Italian tycoon Massimo, who paid Akothee Sh1.8m for a two-hour performance. Tony Nyadundo performed some of his finest Ohangla songs before paving way for the birthday boy, who cut the cake and fed his friends.
