Seven schools and over 500 households will benefit from a Sh6 million water project initiated by community leaders and funded by the national government in Telanet location, Kericho county. The institutions are Telanet, Kipkeron, Ngecherok, St Abraham Academy and Ketitui primary schools and AIC Telanet Girls. Launching the project, Ainamoi MP Sylvanus Maritim said the borehole  will be equipped with powerful solar energy panels to pump water to avoid the high cost of electricity. Maritim who was accompanied by Kapsoit MCA Paul Chirchir stressed the need for the schools to be given the first priority in water supply. “The project will not only improve lives of the locals but will also boost performance in the schools,” Martim said. He urged the schools to utilize the water well and avoid wastage. Maritim said water had become a scarce and expensive  natural resource globally, hence the need for its conservation. Telanet AIC Girls principal Agnes  Karime said the project was timely as students  used to walk for about 2km to fetch water.
