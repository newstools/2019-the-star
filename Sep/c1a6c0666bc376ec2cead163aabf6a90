Dutch Tycoon Tob Cohen will be buried on Monday in a private ceremony. Lawyers from both sides of the family agreed that Cohen will be buried at a Jewish cemetery in Nairobi at 2pm. Jewish tradition prescribes that a person should be buried as quickly as possible, usually after 36 hours, but this would be impractical given the circumstances. Speaking during a press briefing on Thursday, Cohen's lawyer  Cliff Ombeta and the accused lawyer Philip Murgor said Cohen's widow Sarah and Cohen's sister Gabrie will participate in the event. "The burial rites will be in accordance with Jewish rites by the concerned community leaders," Ombeta said. According to the two, the DPP, DCI, and Prison Authorities are requested by both Sarah and Gabriel to facilitate the arrangement. "...so that the late Cohen can be accorded a dignified send as proposed," Murgor said. The funeral of the Late Cohen will proceed subject to obtaining a court order allowing the estranged wife to attend. The Dutch billionaire's decomposing body was found last Friday afternoon — eight weeks after his disappearance —in an empty underground water tank at his posh Kitisuru villa. His body was wrapped in many layers of black plastic. Cohen was reported missing from his Lower Kabete home in Nairobi between July 19 and July 20. The killers of slain Dutchman smashed his skull, dislocated his left leg and broke his hands as he desperately fought them off. A scan on Tuesday of Cohen's body revealed the painful death the former Phillips Chief Executive officer suffered at the hands of his killers.
