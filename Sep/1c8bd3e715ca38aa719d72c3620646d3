Greensharks coach Ben Owaga plans to drop two midfielders for strikers in a bid to overpower United States International University(USIU) A Mashujaa at the City Park Stadium tomorrow. "I will have to drop one or two midfielders because we want to cause problems for them. We have worked hard and the results are a manifestation of how we have dramatically improved. With the quartet of captain Victor Osiche, Chris Wokila, Chris Muchwanju and Clayson Luvanda we can match any team," said Owaga. The Kenya Hockey Union(KHU) Premier League outfit are enjoying the form of their lives and welcome Kevin Simiyu from injury adding selection dilemma in the department. Sharks will be keen to return to winning ways following 1-1 all draw with Western Jaguars a fortnight ago. Sharks sit third with 20 points.

She said: "We know the season has not been good for our opponents but we cannot underrate them. " Second-placed USIU A Spartans will hope to win their fourth consecutive match when they face Sailors.
