Kenya’s Barnaba Korir was among six sportsmen and women who were inducted over the weekend by the Iowa University over the weekend in the United States of America. Korir, the chairman of Athletics Kenya Nairobi region studied at the institution between 1985 to 1988, was recognised for his efforts competing in 5,000m, 3,000m steeplechase and cross country, setting college records that remain until now. The Athletics Kenya Committee Member and in charge of Youth and Development was inducted alongside Gina Curtis (1998-2003), the five-time All American high jumper, Jack Flemming (1935-1937), Iowa State second-best basketball player, Jason Knutzon (1995-1999), record gold team player, Seneca Wallace (2001-2002), quarterback and Don Wengert (1989-1992) basketball player. After his induction at the 60,000 capacity seater stadium, Korir said being recognised by the university outside his native land was a feeling very difficult to express. “I must thank the Iowa State University for these good moments. It is one of the best universities in the world in both academics and sports,” said Korir. “Kenyan athletes are respected worldwide for the impact they have made in sports particularly athletics. It’s time we relook as a nation on how we can harness this important sector.” As a student from 1985 to 1988 at the Iowa University, he was a six-time Big Eight champion, having won the 10,000m, 5,000m, One Mile, Cross Country, Distance Medley relay and 4 x1,600m between 1987 and 1988. Apart from that, he is also a three-time all-America 5,000m and cross country champion. He also won three titles during the 1988 Big Eight Indoor Championships where he was declared the most valuable athlete. With all these accolades, Korir said the nation has to do more to Kenyan athletes, observing that President Uhuru Kenyatta and Sports Cabinet Secretary Ambassador Amina Mohamed can help achieve this due to their love for sports. “The president has sports development at heart. The formation of the Sports Fund is a milestone in itself and its management will ensure sports across the board will grow. The CS for Sports, Amina Mohamed has shown the determination to change how sport is managed. With her goodwill, it’s upon the federations to ensure that focus is on the athlete and all other aspects are done professionally and within the rules,” said Korir
