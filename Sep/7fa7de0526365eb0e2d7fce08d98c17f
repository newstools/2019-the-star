Uganda athletes are expected to grace the Safaricom Kisii 10km road race tomorrow in Kisii town. They will be led by Brian Monisak who has been training at Mochenwa Athletics Camp in Nyamira County. The Ugandans will, however, face stiff competition from local athletes among them experienced road racer Dickson Simba, former junior international Edwin Mokua, Duke Moranga, Wycliffe Onyancha and Richard Atuya. Experienced road runners Winfrida Moseti, Nancy Kerage and Teresia Omosa have also confirmed participation and start favourites in the women's race. Athletics Kenya (AK) Nyanza South treasurer David Ogechi said they expect an explosive event. “With the Sh100, 000 up for grabs in the main race, we expect top athletes from Kisii, Nyamira and neighbouring counties,” said Ogechi. Registration start today and its only Sh300. Ogechi said the race will start at Gusii Stadium's gate 'B' and finish inside the stadium after meandering around town. “The course has been approved by Athletics Kenya and the sponsors. The race will be flagged off outside Gusii Stadium then the athletes will head to Hema Hospital, Daraja Mbili market, Gesonso, Nyamokenye, Nyabioto, Nyanchwa then finish inside the stadium,” said Ogechi. The race was reduced to 10km road race from half marathon to conform with Athletics Kenya's road running restrictions on prize awards.
