Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji should not relent in the fight against corruption, the National Council of Churches of Kenya has said. Suspects in public office should step aside on the basis of Chapter 6 of the Constitution on leadership and integrity, the organisation said. “Our position is that there should be no sacred cows in the fight against corruption and public officers mentioned for being responsible for mismanaging public funds and impoverishing Kenyans should not be spared irrespective of their positions in society,” NCCK upper Eastern region chairman Rev David Ngige said. He addressed the press after presiding over a county dialogue conference held at the PCEA church in Chuka town. Ngige said the NCCK was opposed to heavy borrowing by the government and saw no need for the proposed referendum on constitutional reforms. “From our discussions in this conference it has come out clearly that the participants are against the government setting exponential budgets leading to over-reliance on external borrowing and finally translating into excessive taxation of the citizens,”  Ngige said. He the conference also highlighted integrity of elections and agreed that the  Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission should be strengthened by sending home officers who have been associated with election irregularities in the past. “We believe that most of the officers serving in the IEBC have been there for too long to be entrusted with an impartial election and it is our understanding that it is time that they are replaced with a new vigorous team that will be ready to take the integrity challenge,”  Rev Ngige said.
