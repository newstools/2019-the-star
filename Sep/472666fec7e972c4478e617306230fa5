The role of forests in supporting food security and nutrition in Africa remains largely under-researched, the Food and Agriculture Organization said. FAO country representative Gabriel Rugalema said adequate attention has not been given at policy level to the link between forests and food security and nutrition. “With food security and nutrition high on the agenda in Kenya, it is crucial to understand the contribution of forests and trees to a food secure and nutrition-sensitive future," he said. Speaking during tree planting at the National Youth Service training college in Gilgil, Rugalema called for more initiatives in agroforestry. FAO will partner with the NYS to train 60,000 recruits on growing trees on farms that can provide farmers with food, income, fodder and medicines as well as enrich the soil and conserve water. The FAO country representative who was accompanied by NYS director general Matilda Sakwa said policy makers should not place agriculture and forestry in opposition to each other. “Without forests, the vital ecosystem service provided by birds and insects would be diminished, resulting in increased food security concerns. They are important in providing ecosystem services, including maintaining or restoring soil fertility, protecting watersheds and water courses,” Sakwa said. “For most of the year, herders in arid and semi-arid lands depend on trees as a source of fodder for their livestock,” Rugalema said. He said sustainable management of natural resources could transform forests into direct sources of food, fuel, employment and income. Sakwa said the NYS had planted 10 million trees in its 22 training and holding units countrywide.
