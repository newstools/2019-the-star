Residents of Mombasa have welcomed the construction of a 30,000-metric tonne common user LPG terminal in Kipevu, amidst protests over job losses brought about by the SGR cargo directive. The Sh6 billion project to be built at Focus Freight premises is expected to employ at least 600 people, proprietor Abbas Faisal said. Fifteen tanks of gas with each holding 2000 metric tonnes will be set up on 13 acres. A Sh2 million  water tank will be on standby and firewalls installed to tackle any fire outbreak. The project is set to ease burden of unemployment following closure of CFSs and cargo transport businesses after the the government ordered compulsory use of the SGR for cargo freight. Protesters will hold the third demo on Monday  to force the government to reverse the directive. “Every time we cry for lack of jobs in Mombasa. The same people opposing the project will come here to beg for jobs once the project starts,” Loise Engosso, a Chaani resident, said. She spoke during a public hearing at the proposed site, where a section of residents expressed fears of future fire outbreaks and gas leakages. Tropospace Consultants who did the environmental impact assessment report said that the tanks must be placed underground to minimize chances of fire outbreaks and gas leakages. The project will take one-and-half years to complete. "Such projects normally elicit opposition but I challenge them to focus on long term benefits," Mombasa county speaker Harub Khatri said.
