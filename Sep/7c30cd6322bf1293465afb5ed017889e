Manchester United are sweating on the fitness of Paul Pogba after he injured his ankle against Southampton in Saturday’s 1-1 draw. The Frenchman was seen limping away from St Mary’s and is to undergo a scan to investigate the extent of the damage. The World Cup winner was scheduled to link up with Didier Deschamps’ squad but withdrew on Monday, with Arsenal’s Matteo Gundeouzi earning his first call-up in taking his place.  The severity of the problem is not yet known but as it stands, Pogba is a doubt for United’s return to Premier League action against Leicester in 12 days. When questioned about Pogba, the France boss said: “For Paul, I don’t know, we are waiting for the results, I will keep you updated.” Les Bleus are due to play Albania and Andorra during the international break. And Pogba’s injury will be of concern to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, given his importance to a youthful and inexperienced United side. The Old Trafford club have started the season slowly with just five points from their first four games and will want Pogba fully fit and firing. He played the full 90 minutes on the south coast but was filmed limping badly afterwards.
