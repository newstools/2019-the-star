Parking fees within Mombasa CBD will go up by 100 per cent to Sh200 if the County Financial Bill is passed. The draft bill was on Wednesday subjected to public participation at Tononoka Social Hall and met resistance from residents who termed the increment abnormal. The county government targets to raise Sh4.5 billion this year up from last year's Sh3.8 billion. It will receive Sh9.3 billion from the exchequer, which includes Sh6.9 billion counties' equitable share and Sh388 million for Coast General Hospital as a conditional grant. In the proposed charges, Mombasa will charge Sh4,400 for monthly parking, up from Sh2,200 for small private vehicles. Annually, a motorist will pay Sh52,800 from Sh26,400 paid last year. Small lorries of up to five tonnes will be charged Sh300 daily or Sh80,400 annually. Vehicles of between five and 10 tonnes will pay Sh1,000 daily from Sh500 or Sh312,000 annually from the initial Sh156,000. In February, the county automated parking services to seal revenue leakages. Before automation, the county was collecting about Sh900,000 daily from parking, but the figure has since risen to Sh1.4 million. Finance executive Maryam Mbarak said they are looking to raise Sh2 million daily. Uber, Taxify and other taxi operators will be charged Sh1,500 monthly stickers, up from Sh1,200 which is 25 per cent increment. However, Car Importers Association of Kenya national chairman Peter Otieno said the new charges are "abnormal and will need to be reviewed". “I have never seen a business hiking its services by 100 per cent. We are proposing at least Sh150 per day for smaller vehicles,” Otieno said. He also questioned the rationale behind how the county was charging showrooms. According to the 2019-20 Finance Bill, showrooms that have a capacity of up to five vehicles are charged Sh25,000 annually, those with a capacity of up to 10 vehicles (Sh40,000) and above 10 vehicles (Sh80,000). “Container Freight Stations, which have a capacity of up to 3,000 vehicles are charged Sh150,000 whereas showrooms that have about 15 cars are charged Sh80,000. This is unrealistic,” he said. Advertisers will pay Sh250,000 from Sh10,000 for billboards on top of buildings. For city clocks, advertisers will be charged Sh70,000 from the previous Sh60,000. “This is majorly to discourage advertisers who want to put up additional structures on top of the building. We do not want billboards above buildings,” Transport Chief Officer Engineer Albert Keno said. Finance CEC Mbarak said they have taken all the recommendations into consideration and will attach them to the bill before it is tabled before the assembly. Edited by R.Wamochie
