Over 23,000 primary school children in Ol Kalou constituency will by the end of this month get new desks. The 12.2 million project will benefit 76 primary schools in the constituency, with 46 of them in Nyandarua Central and 30 in Mirangine subcounty. A total of 4,484 desks will be distributed to the schools depending on the number of pupils . “If you have few children you will receive few desks. Some schools are literally overcrowded," Ol Kalou MP David Kiaraho said. The MP addressed head teachers and boards of management at Ol Kalou CDF office on Friday when he gave cheques for the project. Schools will be responsible for buying their desks costing Sh2,500 each. Kiaraho said the CDF office came up with the sample desk sampled from various contractors on the basis of quality and cost. “We have told the head teachers no desk should exceed the agreed upon cost and that the desks will meet the standard. We have also insisted that they will be made from cypress,” he said. Money for the project was raised in a fundraiser conducted last November where Deputy President William Ruto was the chief guest.
