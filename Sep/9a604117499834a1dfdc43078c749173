Media personality Janet Mbugua's secondborn child Mali turned a year old yesterday. Taking to social media to mark the occasion, Janet wrote, "It was around this time, a year ago today, that this precious, loving, unproblematic baby was born. "Happy birthday, Mali. Love you in my heart and my bones. Keep that calm, kind and warm spirit. Always. Folks, letâ€™s constantly surround our little ones with love, with prayer, with wisdom, intending to raise Kings and Queens." Her husband Eddie posted a photo with his son and captioned it, "And just like that, we are one year old! Happy first birthday, Mali. May God fill your gentle spirit with grace and favour for many more years to come! I love and bless you, son!"
