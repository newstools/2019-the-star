 The filth-discharging Mulot slaughterhouse in Bomet has been closed indefinitely and meat consumers will have to get their supply elsewhere. The National Environmental Management Authority made good its threat and shut the slaughterhouse for failure to comply with effluent discharge regulations. The abattoir, alongside 40 others, had last month been given 30 days to obtain public health licences on waste disposal. The affected slaughterhouse had for weeks been discharge raw waste – a mixture of water, blood and entrails – on the Mulot-Narok highway, according to Bomet Nema official Wilfred Osumo. “The closure is indefinite. No animal will be slaughtered until all the standards are adhered to … the county has not conducted any environmental assessment on it as the slaughterhouse does not even have any waste stabilisation ponds,” Osumo said. He accused the county of turning a blind eye to the health risks posed by such waste.  Osumo said the Nema-issued effluent discharge licence stipulates the conditions under which waste is released from abattoirs. It also provides the guidelines and standards for the discharge of poisons, toxins, noxious, radioactive waste and other pollutants into the environment. The official accused the county of deliberately ignoring environmental regulations as the abattoirs are in deplorable condition.
