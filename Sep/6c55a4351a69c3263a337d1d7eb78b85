For the second year running, the Ndakaini Half Marathon in Murang’a County will not have prize money for elite athletes. “This year, as was the case last year, the race will not feature prize money for elites," said Ndakaini Environmental Conservation Association (NDEKA) sports chairman James Mukuna. The race, set for November 9, seeks to raise funds towards conserving Ndakaini Dam’s catchment area. The event will feature the challenging 21km race, the scenic 10km course and the 5km family fun run. In its 15 years, the race has been able to raise over Sh120m in funding towards the conservation of the Ndakaini Dam. Apart from conservation, the 21km event has over the years been considered as one of the toughest half marathons in the world, attracting both international and local athletes who test themselves on the hilly terrain. The half marathon has nurtured some of the country’s long-distance including Abel Kirui, Samuel Wanjiru and Patrick Kipng’eno. “Apart from conservation, the main purpose for this event is to nurture upcoming talents in road races in Kenya. The marathon has always attracted great interest from amateur runners over the years and we expect a similar turn out this year,” added Mukuna. Mukuna noted that interest from the corporate sector to take part in this year’s event has been considerably big with their unveiling set for the near future. Registration for the race is now open via www.ndakaini.co.ke at Sh1,500 per person. The organisers are targeting 5,000 fun runners.
