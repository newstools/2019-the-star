The construction firm hired to do works at Suneka Airstrip in Kisii has fought backs claims of lethargy. Vincent Marube, whose Vinbel Construction Firm has been at the centre of criticism over delays, now says they have finished their part of the project and are ready to hand it over by end month to the contracting agency, the Kenya Airports Authority. "Work on site has been going on in phases and it is wrong for some people to say there has been nothing done so far," Marube told the Star on phone. "We are handing it in by the end of this month so that we concentrate on other projects too," said Marube. Last week the government said it was mulling suspending him from proceeding with the remaining works citing constant delays that have dogged the project. County Commissioner Godfrey Kigochi and a team from the Presidential Delivery Unit, who toured the site, expressed dismay over the slow pace by the contractor. Already, the government has sunk more than Sh60 million into phase one of the project, which involves the construction of the pavilion, visitors lounge and a perimeter fence around the airstrip, which the firm has been undertaking for more than four years. During the tour, Kigochi said substantial work was yet to be done by the contractor, whom he termed as dodgy. He said the project was already behind the schedule adding that other similar projects being done elsewhere have since been operationalised while the Suneka was yet to be concluded. The project, said Kigochi, was to be handed in by last August and open stage for the second phase, which includes the construction of the runway. An additional Sh134 million has since been allocated by the exchequer for the runway.
