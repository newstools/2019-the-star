Medics who are alumni of Starehe School held a free medical camp in Kariokor clinic last weekend to celebrate and give back to the community around the school, who have stood by the school over the last 60 years. Nairobi woman representative Esther Passaris, Vivo Energy head of marketing Mark Senteu and embattled Nairobi speaker Beatrice Elachi attended the event and donated blood. Passaris and Elachi encouraged women, in particular, to take charge of their reproductive health and have cervical cancer screening and family planning for their well-being. A dozen specialised doctors provided services on health and wellness screening and counselling, clinical consultations, cancer screening (prostate, cervical and breast), dental care and optical care.
