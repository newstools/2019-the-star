Christian Eriksen has no regrets about going public with his wish to leave Tottenham but expressed his disappointment at failing to get a move. Eriksen admitted in June that he was ‘at a place in my career where I might want to try something new’ after six years at Spurs. Despite encouraging his suitors, interest from the likes of Real Madrid, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain failed to materialise into a move. The Danish playmaker, 27, said: “No it wasn’t (wrong) but it is football and you never know what happens in football and many things always come into play. I wish I could decide just as in the Football Manager (game) but unfortunately, I can’t.” Eriksen’s contract expires next summer and he will be free to sign a pre-contract to join a foreign club from January.
