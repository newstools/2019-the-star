Parklands assistant coach Kelly Adolwa has said the recent defensive approach implemented by the team is working as they seek to evade relegation. Besides, he said the return of the club’s top scorer Allan Odongo last season after a 3-month layoff with a ligament injury has given the team a lifeline. The deadly striker scored a double in the 2-2 all draw with Sikh Union on Wednesday. In his absence, the team has struggled in front of goal, scoring only thrice prior to the draw. Having beaten United States International University 3-2 in the first match back in March, victory has remained a mirage since as they continue to dip on the log. The team has drawn four and lost six of their 11 matches played so far and currently languish at the bottom of the pile with seven points. But Kelly affirmed that the tactical tweak will bring the much-needed stability in the team. With only seven points separating them with fifth-placed Jaguars, he feels they are better placed to avoid the drop. He said: “The reality is that we are flirting with relegation. We will fight to the end to stay because the margin between us and mid-table teams can be closed and that gives us hope. Odongo’s return is convenient as he has once again proved why he is highly rated by the team. We have missed his classy goals and we will ensure he hits top form going forward.”.
