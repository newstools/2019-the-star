Peter Tabichi, the Nakuru teacher who won Sh100 million after clinching the 2019 Global Teacher Prize, met US President Donald Trump on Monday. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Tabichi's dedication, hard work, and belief in his students' talent has led his school to emerge victorious after taking on the countryâ€™s best schools in national science competitions. Tabichi, who teaches maths and physics at Keriko Mixed Day Secondary School in Nakuru county, beat nine other contestants to take home the grand prize of $1 million (Sh100 million) in March. Two students taught by Tabichi were crowned winners in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Award in May. Esther Amimo Anyanzwa and Salome Njeri won a prize of $2,000 (Sh200,000) for developing a device for visually impaired and deaf learners to measure length. Tabichi gives 80 per cent of his salary to the poor. The Global Teacher Prize honours one exceptional teacher every year who has made an outstanding contribution to the profession as well as to shine a spotlight on the important role teachers play in the society. The 36-year-old Egerton University graduate has been a teacher for 12 years. Tabichi integrates ICT into 80 per cent of his lessons, along with science quizzes, low-cost apparatus and fosters collaboration by incorporating peer-to-peer learning. When applying for the competition last year, Tabichi said he was just trying his luck.
