The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority has introduced new regulations to curb unauthorised LPG cylinders filling and enhancing consumer safety. In a statement, the authority said all LPG cylinders retailers, wholesalers and transporters will be required to hold licenses from them for each business location. The licences will be specific to the authorised cylinder brands only. The authority warned all LPG cylinder traders and transporters not to undertake the business of retail, wholesale or transportation of cylinders of another brand owner without prior written consent from them. "All LPG cylinders retailers, wholesalers and transporters shall henceforth not undertake the business of retail, wholesale or transportation of cylinders of another brand owner without prior written consent from the brand owner, failure to which it shall be considered as an offence under section 99 of the Petroleum Act 2019," the statement read. EPRA said that businessmen that will not comply will be liable to a fine not less than Sh10 million or a term of imprisonment of not less than five years or to such a fine and imprisonment or the withdrawal of their operating licence.
