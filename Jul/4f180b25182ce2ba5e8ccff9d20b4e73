A statement by the operator attributed the growth to an aggressive marketing strategy targeting importers and exporters in Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan and the DRC, to use the Mombasa – Nairobi SGR freight services as their preferred logistics partner. “We have also set up our marketing team and provided practical and feasible advice to KRC and relevant authorities for incremental freight transportations.” Dai Yunjie, the spokesman of Africa Star, the SGR operator. The company added that passenger services  with the Madaraka Express led to a total of 764,000 passengers in the first half of the year from January to June, despite the effects of the Dusit D2 terror attack, which caused a 10.1 per cent drop in passenger traffic in January. The passenger traffic is similar to the number ferried in the corresponding period last year.
