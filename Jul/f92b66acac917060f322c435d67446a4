New boss Antonio Conte is fuming after Inter Milan started weighing up cheaper alternatives to Romelu Lukaku, according to reports. The Manchester United striker has been linked with a move to the Italian giants for much of the summer and it appeared Inter were inching closer to landing their target for a fee of around £75million. But Inter have reportedly ‘hit a wall’ with United’s demands over the transfer and have turned their attention towards Edinson Cavani. The Uruguayan’s contract at Paris Saint-Germain expires next summer, and following previous spells at Napoli and Palermo is a proven goal scorer in Serie A. A London meeting between United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and Inter chief Piero Ausilio failed to produce an agreement over a fee and it leaves Lukaku facing an uncertain future. Inter are looking at a two-year loan worth £9m with a view to a permanent £54m move, but United want to recoup most of the £90m fee they paid Everton for the striker two years ago. Lukaku hinted an end to the saga would come this week after claiming news would develop following United’s clash with Perth Glory on Saturday. But Conte is believed to be angry at the way his new employers have started breaking promises they made when they convinced him to take the job. Conte was assured he would be able to take a full squad on the club’s pre-season tour of Asia, including Lukaku. He was also told the likes of Mauro Icardi, Radja Nainggolan and Jaoa Mario would be offloaded but they are all still at the club.
