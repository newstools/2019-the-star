Inmates of Kamiti Maximum Security Prison's bible school graduated with certificates on Wednesday last week. The Mahanaim Bible College sponsored them and taught them from the beginning to the end. Parents and loved ones of the inmates were also invited, and they were impressed by the lessons imparted.
