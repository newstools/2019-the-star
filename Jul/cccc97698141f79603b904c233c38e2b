Tundo, who is chasing a record 6 wins on the Safari, treated spectators to some exhilarating displays on the day’s 4.8km stage. African Rally Champion Manvir Baryan and his British partner Drew Sturrock had to contend with playing second fiddle to Tundo, but as experts say, it’s still early days. Baryan who is also the ARC leader settled for fifth incidentally 04.3secomds behind Tundo. Tundo’s teammate Onkar Rai was third fastest, losing out to Gomes by just 1 millisecond, meaning only 4.3 seconds separate the leading four crews heading into today.

A total of 48 drivers started the event which also counts towards the FIA African rally Championship (ARC). President Uhuru Kenyatta flagged off the first 10 cars and was among the thousands of spectators who graced the super special. Day 1 (Leg1A) featured only one stage after the 13km Gatamaiyo Forest stage was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions. Following the cancellation of SS2 Gatamaiyo, rally traffic proceeded to overnight parc ferme at Naivasha’s Sopa Lodge.
