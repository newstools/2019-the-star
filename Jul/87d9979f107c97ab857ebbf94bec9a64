Liaison Group has unveiled a new brand identity to reflect the company's evolution into a non-banking financial services organisation. The ceremony was marked with pomp and glamour at their offices on May 24. Founded in 1981, the firm now boasts a masterclass architecture that features four main business units: Risk and Insurance, Healthcare, Pensions and Investment Advisory. The rebranding includes a complete redesign of the company's logo, website, graphics and templates. The new brand assets will include a clearer blue and white logo, along with visual elements that utilise simple yet bold graphics to convey complex solutions in relatable ways.
