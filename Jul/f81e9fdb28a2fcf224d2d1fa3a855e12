Former Manchester United and Everton forward Wayne Rooney has hailed Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp. The Reds boss lifted the Champions League just last month and also narrowly missed out on becoming Premier League champions by only one point. Since moving to Anfield four years ago, the German has been a huge hit with Liverpool fans and now Rooney has sung his praises. “Jurgen is a coach every professional would like to play for,” he told Sport Bild. “You can tell his players how much fun they have with him. I’ve met him a couple of times, he’s a great person. His only mistake is that he works at Liverpool and has success there! “I have great respect for Jurgen Klopp and what he has done so far. Not only in Liverpool, but also in Dortmund. He has the best years ahead of him.” Rooney made 117 appearances for Liverpool’s Merseyside rivals Everton as well as 559 appearances for the Reds other foes Manchester United. Klopp and his Liverpool side jetted off to the United States on Tuesday for their pre-season tour ahead of the new campaign.
