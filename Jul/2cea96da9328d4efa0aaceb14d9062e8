We didn’t understand much on the terms of the agreement but we gladly accepted the peace that resulted from the truce especially after the 2017 elections.

The BBI team is yet to release its report but the strategic messages being sent to the electorate may just be the recommendations we are waiting for. If the handshake is well intended, then let it not be a tool for breeding animosity and ethnicity. Kakamega
