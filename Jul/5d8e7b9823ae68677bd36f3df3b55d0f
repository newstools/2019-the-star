Kerich will also monitor and evaluate the follow up mechanisms for resources allocated to all sectors and priority programme and projects to ensure proper utilization of the targeted outcomes. He will also provide supervisory leadership throughout the delivery cycle of all county Government Programmes and Projects. In addition, Kerich will also present accurate and timely progress to the Governor and any other function ancillary to the above as may be directed by Sonko.
