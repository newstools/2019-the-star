Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) will push to third place in the women’s premier league if they win their two city matches this weekend. The ports women have two easy matches against University of Nairobi Dynamites tomorrow and Africa Nazarene University (ANU) on Sunday. KPA, who arguably have the best team in the league, got off to a slow start but seems to have got their acts together. In their last visit to the city, KPA suffered a heartbreaking 79-70 defeat to leaders Equity Bank in overtime. The bankers, who play Eagle Wings, have 27 points and should maintain their lead with a win. Wins for KPA will move them to 24 points.
