Nairobi county government will dispose of 23 unidentified bodies of victims killed by thugs, accidents, mob justice and/or committed suicide. The bodies, which have spent months at City mortuary, have not been identified by relatives or friends, according to an advert in the local dailies on Friday. “The following 23 unclaimed bodies are lying at the city mortuary from date of admission awaiting collection,” Nairobi County Secretary Leboo Morintant said. “Pursuant to public health Act cap 242 interested members of the public are asked to identify and collect the bodies within days, failure to which the county government will seek Judicial Authority for disposals.” Leboo said in the advert the bodies include that of Lazaro Kimwere (Tag number 7722) admission number 1,722 who died a natural death in Muthaiga on November 8, last year. Jimmy Gaturo (Tag number 8,432) from Tigon died on November 28 last year but his body is yet to be collected.
