A Kenya Revenue Authority commissioner and police at the Isebania One-Stop Border Post on Saturday arrested two Kenyans and a Tanzanian suspected to be behind child trafficking across border point. One month old baby boy was rescued by the officers from the suspects. The authority has said initial investigations point to an elaborate syndicate where Kenyan babies are being taken to Tanzania, issued with birth certificates and returned. Several identification cards and sim cards were seized from the suspects. The infant is in good health in the hands of the Customs Offices with the three suspects in police custody. The authority said it is fully committed to dealing with human trafficking among other illicit cross border activities. A Tanzanian national was also arrested by detectives in April over child trafficking. Musa Mbalu, 30, was nabbed in Maua town believed to be behind a ring trafficking children with special needs and using them to beg at various strategic points.
