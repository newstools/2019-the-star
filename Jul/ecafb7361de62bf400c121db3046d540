Kibra Member of Parliament Ken Okoth was last night rushed to Nairobi Hospital's ICU. This comes two weeks after he made his first official appearance to the public after being away in France for five months seeking treatment for colorectal cancer. He had attended the Kibra Music Fest at Moi Girls School, Nairobi. In March, Okoth told Kenyans that he was managing stage four colorectal cancer and will survive. Okoth, 41, is serving his second term. He showed confidence that he will overcome 'the monster' in a Twitter reply to Benjie Wambui who had asked how he was doing. "How are you Mheshimiwa? I am praying for you today,” Wambui had posted. Okoth responded, “Napambana na hali yangu (I’m managing my condition) and we shall overcome.” His latest pictures, captured after he had undergone chemotherapy, accompanied the reply. “Chemo drugs are brutal on the skin and immune system," Okoth said. Meanwhile, Bomet Governor Joyce Laboso is in the North Wing ward. Laboso had travelled to the United to Kingdom on May 29 to receive treatment. Among those who visited the governor at the London hospital were ODM leader Raila Odinga, Chief Justice David Maraga and Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony.
