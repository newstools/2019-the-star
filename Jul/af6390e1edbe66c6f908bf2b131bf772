The tripartite deal that includes KQ subsidiary, Jambojet will involve provision of a Dash 8 Q400 simulator to support the training expected to improve service of the pilots and Q400 operators in the country and entire continent. The estimated number of Q400 aircrafts in Africa is over 100 being served by only three simulators. “The number of Q400s in Africa is growing, with a limited number of simulators to support the training.
