Marvel studios president Kevin Feige, flanked by dozens of Hollywood stars, revealed the post-Avengers roster of films to a stunned hall in San Diego. Many attendees at world's largest pop-culture fan convention had camped out to reserve a seat for the event. One major surprise was the announcement of Oscar winner Mahershala Ali as Blade the vampire hunter, a role played by Wesley Snipes in the 1998 film. There was rapturous applause and screams as Ali took to the stage to reveal he would take on the role of the day walker. Natalie Portman will play a female Thor Natalie Portman confirmed her return to a fourth Thor film - Thor: Love and Thunder - reprising her role as Jane Foster, but this time wielding the power of the Thor hammer. "Feels pretty good. I've always had a little hammer envy," Portman told the delighted crowd after being handed the hammer by director Taika Watiti. Portman's role is based on Jason Aaron's comic book series that sees Jane Foster become the mighty lady Thor when Thor Odison finds himself unworthy of picking up the hammer. Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson will also return for the film. Earlier the audience were teased with number of new productions and sequels from phase four of the Marvel cinematic universe. The first film to be announced was The Eternals. The cast includes Angelina Jolie, and Salma Hayek appeared on stage in front of the excited audience to talk about their new roles. Jolie, who will play Thena, told the crowd: "I'm going to work ten times harder because I think what it means to be a part of the MCU, what it means to be an Eternal, to be part of this family. I know what we all need to do." "We've all read the script, we all know what the task ahead is and we know what you deserve so we are all going to be working very very hard," she added. The Eternals are powerful beings who look human but have special powers. The film has a release date of November 2020.
