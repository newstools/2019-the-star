Newcastle will monitor Andy Carroll’s injury rehabilitation as they consider offering him an emotional return. Boyhood fan Carroll left St James’ Park eight years ago, as he became the most expensive British player ever when Liverpool paid £35million for him. But his career has since been plagued by injuries and an ankle problem reduced him to just 14 appearances during his final season with West Ham. Manuel Pellegrini opted not to offer Carroll a new deal, although is allowing the striker to use their Rush Green facilities over the summer. It is understood that Newcastle are keen to stay abreast of Carroll’s situation as they look to bolster their attacking options. Both Salomon Rondon and Ayoze Perez have departed, while youngster Elias Sorensen started upfront during the 1-0 Asia Trophy win against West Ham in Shanghai. Yoshinori Muto did his case no harm by scoring a predatory winner but new boss Steve Bruce – who watched from the stands in China - remains desperate for more goals in his squad. They hope to complete a £35m deal for Joelinton at Hoffenheim. The need for additional bodies should see another striker come in and Newcastle may eventually turn to Carroll as well. The 30-year-old is still some way from a return to full training and could be months from being available, although it is a deal that can be down outside the transfer window given he is unattached.  Carroll scored 34 goals in 142 appearances for West Ham since arriving from Liverpool, initially on loan, in August 2012.
