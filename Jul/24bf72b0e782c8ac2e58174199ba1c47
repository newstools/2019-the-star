Today, we mourn the passing of our CEO, Bob Collymore. For nine years, we enjoyed his visionary leadership, his enthusiasm for life, and his commitment to transforming Safaricom into a purpose-led business. Even through his battle with cancer, he remained upbeat, unwaveringly passionate about everything – and everyone – he held dear. From his wife Wambui and their children, to his saxophone, which he spent at least an hour playing every day, to providing leadership to a company he truly loved. Bob was not your ordinary CEO, he was more than that: he was a legend. He didn’t believe in upholding himself above others, or reminding everyone of the position he held. He was a man of the people; a man who believed in true equality and in the power of diversity and inclusion. In integrity, transparency and strong corporate governance; a man who pursued what he believed in with great intention. Bob taught us that it was possible for a business to do good, and be good. That profitability, purpose and a heart for people did not have to be mutually exclusive. He taught us that it was okay not to take ourselves too seriously; that there was nothing wrong with making mistakes as long as we learned from them. Bob was a leader, a mentor, and a friend to us. Because of who he was, Safaricom is what it is today This is a difficult time for all of us, we are hurting. But at the same time, we know that we must find the strength to continue what Bob – and our Founding CEO Michael Joseph – began, and so we commit to honouring his legacy by pursuing his vision, our company’s vision, of transforming lives.
