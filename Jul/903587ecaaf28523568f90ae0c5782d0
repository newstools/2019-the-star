A 14-years-old class eight pupil from Kagaa in Ol Kalou is recovering at JM Memorial Hospital after she was defiled and left unconscious on Sunday morning. The girl was defiled on her bed in their house by the unknown criminal, who dug a hole at the base of their three-roomed timber house to access the children’s bedroom. JM Memorial hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Jorum Muraya described her condition as critical. Her mother said at about 3am she heard some commotion and called one of her sons, who shares the bedroom with the girl asking if he could hear the commotion. He switched on the lights and discovered a man on the top of his sister. “He started screaming calling out to me to rush to their bedroom," the mother said. As she moved to the children bedroom, she met with the culprit, a young man dressing, and then he opened the door and walked out. The mother said found the girl in her bed, bleeding and unconscious. “I moved back screaming and lost consciousness in the sitting room. It is like he had used some chemical on us," she said. A local leader, Daniel Gitau, who also assisted take the girl to the hospital said this is not the first incident for criminals to dig to access the houses as two more were dug recently though no one was harmed. Nyandarua Woman Representative Faith Gitau condemned the incident which she termed as shocking and unacceptable. “I am urging the county commissioner and county police commander to have investigations expedited for the culprit must be someone from within, “she said Acting Nyandarua Central Sub-County Police Commander Florence Karimi said the matter is being investigated. Karimi said such a matter is delicate given that the mother came face to face with the culprit as he exited through the door and she could not recognise him.
