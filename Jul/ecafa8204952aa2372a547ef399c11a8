Sceptics dismiss opinion polls as failing to reflect the situation on the ground. But properly conducted surveys done through sampling represent the wider opinions of a population. For two years after President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto rode to power, the polls have been consistent, except for a brief period after the handshake. The general verdict: Kenya is headed in the wrong direction, with the top four issues being the high living cost, rampant corruption, unemployment and poor governance. What started off as a promising second term has turned into 24-hour politicking and scheming, backstabbing, betrayals, blackmail and assassination claims. The situation hasn't been helped by a  half-hearted anti-graft war, economic policies continuing to impoverish a downtrodden populace and lawmakers who care more about their bellies than millions of Kenyans to whom a daily meal is a luxury. If Kenyans were to conduct an annual appraisal of UhuRuto, they would score poorly. They are completely off the targets they set with their voter-supervisors. They have failed to even reach the halfway mark of their Key Performance Indicators. If the 'servant leaders' were working for a private company, they would be sacked. The best they can do — since we are stuck with them until 2022 — is to report back to work and deliver a sliver of their promises.
