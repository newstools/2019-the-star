Eric Bailly is reportedly fretting over his Manchester United future, with the club pushing to sign England international Harry Maguire from Leicester. The Red Devils have been strongly linked with Maguire, who is valued in the region of £80million by his club. Should the 26-year-old arrive United would have a surplus of central defenders - seven in total - and Bailly feels he will be the one who is moved on, according to the Evening Standard. While Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is hoping for a larger squad next season to deal with the demands of domestic and European football, it is reported that at least one of United’s centre backs will be sold. The Ivorian was former manager Jose Mourinho’s first signing in a £30m deal from Villarreal in 2016 and he impressed during his debut campaign at Old Trafford. Unlike some of his defensive team-mates though, Bailly only has one year to run on his contract and United are yet to begin talks regarding an extension. Victor Lindelof is in line to partner Maguire should he arrive, while Chris Smalling’s future is safe following the signing of a new deal. After previously showing his willingness to select youth stars, Solskjaer recently described Axel Tuanzebe as ‘the future’ of the club following United’s 1-0 win against Inter Milan. The 21-year-old is expected to be given opportunities next season, adding to Bailly’s concerns that he will be surplus to requirement. Phil Jones was handed a bumper new four-year deal earlier in the year, while Marcos Rojo signed a three-year extension in 2018. United were understood to be willing to sell the Argentine, after handing him the deal to prevent a free exit, but their valuation in the region of £20m has become a deterrent.
