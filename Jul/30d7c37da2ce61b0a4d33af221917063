Nairobi is still growing fast and is rapidly becoming a ‘mega city”. Many people go through stressful challenges: in the traffic, at work and even just shopping. In this fast and often crazy world we live in, many people like to “escape from the city” and spend time in a natural environment. The Nairobi National Park is one of those “escape to the wild” places. Over many years, I have noted that most of us are still in “city mode” when we enter a national park, trying to see as much of the created wonders as possible. Our challenge is to quickly snap out of “city mode” into “bush mode”. Here are a few points that work for me. So why not visit the “green island in a sea of concrete”? I hope that your time in the Nairobi wild will be restful and be like a “soul tonic”, a “dawa” medicine for your innermost being. The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.
