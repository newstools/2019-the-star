Manchester United are targeting Blaise Matuidi as one option to bolster their midfield ahead of the transfer window shutting next week, according to reports. According to Corriere di Torino, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side face competition from his former club Paris Saint-Germain though. The Italian publication claims that Matuidi is ‘really liked’ by United as they weigh up a bid for the 32-year-old. Central midfield is one area that the Red Devils wish to strengthen with the club yet to sign other targets Sergej Milinkovic-Savic or Bruno Fernandes and with Real Madrid heavily pursuing Paul Pogba too. Matuidi, a World Cup winner with France last summer, joined Juventus in August 2017 after a successful six-year spell at PSG. During his two seasons at Juve he has won successive Serie A titles and one Coppa Italia—scoring seven goals in 88 appearances. Matuidi is currently with Juventus as their preparations continue ahead of the new season.
