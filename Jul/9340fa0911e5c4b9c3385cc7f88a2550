Farmers in Taita Taveta county have been advised to enrol with the national crop insurance programme before the next long rains. The County Crop Insurance Coordinator  David Simiyu said the programme  is a mitigation measure against drought. Speaking during the cereal field day at Njukini on Thursday, Simiyu said the program helps farmers get compensation from the government in case they face  crops failure due to insufficient rainfall. "Currently the programme  only  insures maize crops but  will extend to other crops from next year. The minimum area to insure is half an acre.
