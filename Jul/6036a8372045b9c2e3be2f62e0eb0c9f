Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed the £30million signing of Idrissa Gueye from Everton on a four-year deal. The former Toffees midfielder completed his medical and settled personal terms in the French capital on Monday, before briefly returning to Senegal before he travels to England to say his goodbyes on Merseyside. PSG and Everton both announced the move early yesterday morning, with the English side thanking the 29-year-old for his efforts over the past three years. Speaking to his new club after signing the deal, Gueye said: “I feel tremendous pride in joining Paris Saint-Germain. After remaining focused on the CAN with my selection, I wanted to give a new impetus to my club career by engaging with Paris Saint-Germain, which offers one of the most structured and ambitious sports projects in the world.” “I thank the leaders, the coach and his staff for the trust they place in me. I will do everything to show myself worthy of this confidence and to integrate quickly into this group of very talented players. Finally, it will be a great pleasure to taste the exceptional atmosphere of the Parc des Princes, which impressed me during my first visit to France! Gueye’s contract goes through until June 30, 2023, and he is the eighth Senegalese player in the French club’s history. He is no stranger to Ligue 1, having played for Lille for seven years before his switch to Aston Villa — in 2015 — and then Everton a year later.
