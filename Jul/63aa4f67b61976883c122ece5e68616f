Virgil van Dijk has played down a heated exchange with Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp and says sometimes the truth just has to be told. The pair were involved in an animated return of words after Napoli’s first goal during Sunday’s 3-0 defeat at Murrayfield. Van Dijk had not been directly to blame for Lorenzo Insigne’s strike but Klopp took issue with his star defender and made his point from the touchline. The player, however, also let his feelings be known and there was a definite annoyance about the Dutchman’s body language as they traded opinions. But Van Dijk, when asked what the issue was, said: “Just things… between me and him. It’s not necessary to reveal what. I think everyone has to communicate with each other. Sometimes you have to tell someone the truth, that’s how it is.” Liverpool were well beaten by the Italians and Klopp later said that the only positive was the pre-match welcome they received in Scotland. Van Dijk, though, says the return to training of Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino and Alisson this week will make a big difference, even though they are not expected to start against Manchester City in Sunday’s Community Shield. “It was quite sloppy at times, but there’s no concerns from my point of view,” he added. “Our season starts properly next Sunday, so our focus will be on that. Everyone knows the players who are missing are important players for us. That’s a fact.” “There’s plenty more to come from the team. There’s a reason why we are European champions. We have to stay calm, we want to win games.” “But we have to be at our top level (on Sunday). If we play like that, we won’t win the Community Shield, it’s as simple as that. We have a good week to prepare ourselves with a friendly as well, which is good for the boys who are coming back. We will definitely be ready for City.”
