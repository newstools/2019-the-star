Anne Mumbi Waiguru is set to exchange vows with the love of her life, a prominent lawyer Kamotho Waiganjo. President Uhuru Kenyatta, deputy president William Ruto and Opposition chief Raila Odinga are among the dignitaries attending the wedding at the Kiamugumo Primary School. Others are Education CS Amina Mohamed, Murang'a Woman Rep Sabina Chege, Interior PS Karanja Kibicho, Transport CS James Macharia and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka. This comes after a private dowry ceremony was held in February. Today's much-hyped traditional wedding well known as Ngurario. Waiganjo served in constitution implementation commission. Waiganjo paid the bride price for Waiguru in Kiamungo village, Kirinyaga on February 16. He was married to a Nairobi-based publishing consultant and journalist Lorna Seneiya with whom he had three children. Waiganjo has represented Waiguru in several court cases, including an election petition that challenged her victory at the last election. It was filed by Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua. Frequent representation of her in court aroused speculations that the two had a love affair. They, however, dismissed that, saying their relationship started 10 years down the line in a ferry as they were travelling to a constitutional conference in Mombasa. The two then had their first date at Thai Restaurant in Nairobi, leading to the current relationship. Waiganjo is from Murang'a. Waiguru warned that her marriage to Waiganjo should not be politicised. He hinted that some people had started interfering in her private life with politics
