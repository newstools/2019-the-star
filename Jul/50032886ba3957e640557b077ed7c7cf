University of Nairobi Dynamites coach Juma Kent is happy the team is playing well and he is already looking beyond the playoffs. The campus girls exploded over Western Delight, winning 70-41 in a Premier League match at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium. “ My players are really playing well. We took them ahead on from the word go and easily rolled away,” said Kent. “I want to target a good finish before the play-offs.

Delight were pepped by Immaculate Cheruto who had 14. In another top women’s game, Storms had 24 points from Lynette Atieno and 17 from Steffi Ngabure as they blew away Eagle Wings 67-58. “I missed my key players in this game and besides, most of my players have not been training well,” Wings coach Evelyn Kedogo said.
