The nation has recently lost two high profile personalities to cancer. The Jubilee government should, through its Universal Healthcare agenda,Â  pump money into the construction of a hospital to save Kenyans the costs of travelling outside the country for treatment.

Unfortunately, our leaders are busy politicking for 2022 and fat allowances to live a large instead of investing in finding a solution.  Turkana
