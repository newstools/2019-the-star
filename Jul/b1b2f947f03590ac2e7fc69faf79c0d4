Bumps on the Kisumu-Kericho Road are discouraging to tourists who may want to visit those areas. There is one about every 50 metres. l have never seen the Chinese construct a road with bumps. Let engineers revisit and remove the bumps as tourists will not use such roads. How about a woman in labour being taken to the hospital, will she not deliver on the road? But our leaders who are always flying wouldnâ€™t know the discomfort Wanjiku is travelling in. As much as they compel drivers to slow down hence reduce accidents, too many will bring harm. Mombasa
