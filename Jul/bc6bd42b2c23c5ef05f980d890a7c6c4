When the Star published a feature about a youthful innovator from Busia, I thought the leaders in the county would support her initiative. After graduating with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Nutrition and Food Engineering in 2012, Etyang Ikarede, 31, tried unsuccessfully to get a job. She resorted to self-employment, making chocolate from millet and other locally available products. It has a market in the US, but she is unable to satisfy that market because of stringent regulations. Our leaders could provide a market for her product locally while realising some of the Big Four agenda.  Nairobi
