Frank Lampard insisted he was pleased with a tough work out for Chelsea against Bohemians and the attitude of his players in their opening week back in training. Lampard’s team drew 1-1 in Dublin in his first game at the helm. Michy Batshuayi fired them into an early lead before trialist Eric Molloy levelled in the 89th minute. Lampard said: “It was a good run-out, we had good support and thanks for people turning out. It was a tough first game for us as we have not been back for long. Just a few days. So there had been some pressure on the lads and we have been working them very hard. I am pleased with the outcome.” “Fitness was our issue. I wanted to stretch them a bit and put them under pressure. This is what pre-season is all about and the quicker we get there, to the level we want, then the better. We wanted to win the game as you always do but it is not about that. It is about individuals getting fit and pushing themselves to the limit and I thought some of the performances – particularly from the younger lads – was really good.” Chelsea have 35 players at their training base near Dublin and 22 played for 45 minutes each against Bohemians. Others will feature on Saturday against St Patrick’s before they head for two games in Japan. “I have been really happy,” said Lampard. “We have high standards and we have brought that in. We need intensity in our game and I am pleased with the way their have worked and their attitude. This game was very early but the other players are back other than the injured boys and Pulisic is not with us yet but you will see some of them at the weekend.”
