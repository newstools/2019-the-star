The Association of Lamu Boat Owners wants all 5,000 boats in the archipelago to obey all rules for seagoing vessels from licensing and registration to prohibiting drunken skippers. On Monday it announced it was launching a safety drive and inspection. Lamu county has more than 5,000 boats operating in n the archipelago. The Kenya Maritime Authority Lamu office said on Monday that most seagoing vessels operating in Lamu have not undergone registration and licensing. Only 300 vessels of more than 2,000 sea vessels have complied to all set standards for safe and efficient water transport, it said. About 99 per cent of Lamu transport in Lamu is by sea. Speaking to the media in Lamu town on Monday, association chairperson Hassan Awadh said they want to emphasise to their members the need for and the benefits of observing all rules and following the law. He said violators will be punished for deliberately violating regulations. In a few days the association will also carry out checks an vetting of all vessels and operating personnel, Award said. He said a major problem is drunken boat operators, saying they will obtain Breathalyzers to enable them to detect intoxicated boat operators and stop them from operating. "The rules might seem frustrating but they are life-saving. We want to boost discipline. Lack of it has caused many accidents and deaths and we will punish violators,” Awadh said. KMA is undertaking a countrywide safety campaign. The authority also reported a recent worrying increase in the number of accidents in Kenyan waters. Numbers have increased since 2009, it said. KMA director general George Okong’o said 50 per cent of accidents involve capsized vessels, while 40 per cent are drownings caused by unseaworthy vessels. Kenya has lost 242 people and another 330 people were rescued from maritime accidents in the last 10 years. Edited by R.Wamochie
