Naby Keita has checked back in at Liverpool for medical tests after suffering an injury blow while on Africa Cup of Nations duty. The Liverpool midfielder was an unused substitute in Guinea’s victory over Burundi on Sunday in Egypt after picking up a thigh injury in a 1-0 loss to Nigeria last Wednesday. And following the setback, Keita has reported back to Merseyside as he looks to find out the extent of his injury. After their comfortable 2-0 win against Burundi, Guinea disclosed that Keita had left the camp for further medical consultation at Liverpool. “A match that Guinea could play without Naby Keita. Injured against Nigeria, the European champion leaves Egypt tonight for medical consultation in England,’ read a statement from the country’s FA. “The player should still return to Egypt for the rest of the competition.” Liverpool will be cautious about Keita’s latest injury after he also missed the Champions League final with an adductor injury.
