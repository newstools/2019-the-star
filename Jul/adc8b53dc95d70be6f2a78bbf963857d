Kenyan TV personality Esther Arunga, now a parolee, was sentenced to 10 months outside bars of prisons because she said the truth and the truth set her free. Justice has been served. First, they made Arunga speak out. And sentenced her to serve the term amidst other members of society. No need to crowd prisons, which in most cases make people worse than they were before they were put there. She will serve her sentence under close supervision of prisons authorities to be of good conduct. Thatâ€™s a superb justice served on her.  Mombasa
