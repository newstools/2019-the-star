Rayvanny’s baby mama Fahima says she has converted to Christianity from Islam. She opened up about her faith for the first time in an interview with Yo Fave. “Honestly, I have changed my religion. I didn’t change because I want to forcefully get married. I changed because my boyfriend and kid are Christians, my grandmother was Christian and my mum was brought up in a Christian home,” she said. Asked about tying the knot, she said, “The wedding is there, people should just wait. It will be as soon as possible.” Fahima has sired a child for the WCB signee rapper. Apostasy in Islam is commonly defined as the conscious abandonment of Islam by a Muslim in word or through a deed. Islamic scholars differ in their opinions on the definition and whether and how it should be punished.
