Senegalese designer Sarah Diouf has posted images of her clothes worn by musician Beyoncé in her video for the song Spirit. The song is part of the album: Lion King The Gift which features several African musicians and is to be released on Friday. In the video, Beyoncé appears in designs made by Diouf's brand Tongoro , which makes all its clothes in Senegal. This isn’t the first time Beyoncé has worn Tongoro, she dressed in its designs while vacationing in Italy in 2018: Diouf, quoted in Cosmopolitan, described the brand as a "100% Made In Africa label". Beyoncé has described the song Spirit, and the rest of the Lion King album, as a "love letter to Africa", and said she wanted to ensure that it consisted of "the best talent from Africa". Spirit opens with Swahili lyrics. "Uishi kwa mda mrefu mfalme," a voice chants twice, with a deeper voice responding"uishi kwa". The phrase means: "Long live the king."
