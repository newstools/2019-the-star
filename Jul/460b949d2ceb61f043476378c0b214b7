Currently, Del Monte Kenya employs over 6,500 employees and creates additional 28,000 jobs indirectly through its activities. The company houses half of its workforce within the company’s premises. “From the moment we embarked on our relationship with Kenya, just after the country gained its independence, we have been proud to make investments in the people and prosperity of Kenya as a nation,” Gkaliamoutsas said. He added that Del Monte is supporting the realisation of Kenya’s Big Four Agenda for local cultivation,agro-processing, and full-value-added support for manufacturing and food security. “We are looking forward to continuing to demonstrate the many ways in which Del Monte Kenya can be a valued, respected, responsible corporate citizen of the Republic of Kenya, its economy, and the well-being of all its citizens’’, Gkaliamoutsas said.
