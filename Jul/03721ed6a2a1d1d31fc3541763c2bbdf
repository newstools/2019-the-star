Baldev Singh Chager navigated by Ravi Soni in a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X savoured his third career Safari Rally as the fourth round of the FIA African Rally Championship culminated in Naivasha. His calm and assured drive to the last service at Sopa Lodge belied the excitement that was bubbling underneath and it exploded into a solid stream of joy at the prize giving. Chager, who won back to back Safari titles in 2013 and 2014, had his campaign effectively sewn up when Manvir Baryan suffered radiator problems on the second run of Kedong section which was the last for the day. Manvir had a 33 seconds advantage over Chager going into the last section at Kedong but due to thick dust, he had to contend with serious overheating problems when his radiator got clogged with volcanic ash soil. It was a bitter pill for Manvir to swallow as Safari victory proved elusive for the umpteenth time. Tundo finished second overall while Manvir settled for third much to his chagrin. Ian Duncan finished a distant fourth. Chager was all smiles after victory and this is what he had to say: “This is the most intense and probably the most challenging Safari I have ever done, to be honest. I mean, every stage was a matter of seconds with the top four until Onkar (Rai) went out. There was no room for mistakes, it was about full focus and 100 per cent attack mode. Manvir was leading up till the last stage but his car sucked some dust on Kedong. When we saw Manvir stuck three quarters way through the last stage with his bonnet open, we just knew we were ahead as we had already picked up three minutes on him, because he started three minutes ahead of us.” Manvir wasn’t happy with the running of Kedong stage and said: “The last stage shouldn’t have been run because it was dug up so deep and wasn’t fit for rally cars. We actually didn’t get stuck but our radiator got clogged with dust.”  Provisional Results: 1.Baldev Chager/Ravi Soni (Kenya/Mitsubishi Lancer Evo10) 164.30. 2.
