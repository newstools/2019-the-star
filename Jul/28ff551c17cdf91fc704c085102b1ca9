Starlets are slated to face Malawi in the first leg on August 28, with the second leg set to be played on September 1. However, the three are expected to join training next week. The team, under the tutelage of David Ouma, will, however, break camp on Friday to allow players to turn up for their respective clubs ahead of the weekends WPL. Starlets got a bye into the first round and will be up against either of Gabon or Ghana in the second round should they pass the Malawi test.
