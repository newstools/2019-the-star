Members of the public gathered at Mustard Seed Court, Dandora for a free public screening of the Netflix miniseries, 'When They See Us'. The critically acclaimed movie by Ava DuVernay documents how four black boys and a Latina were unlawfully arrested for and wrongfully charged with sexually assaulting a white woman jogger, found nearly dead at Central Park. The event, #WhenTheySeeUsKE, brought together ex-convicts, members of the judiciary, filmmakers, prisons personnel, human rights defenders and community gatekeepers. It sought to create awareness on the rights of persons arrested, the right to a fair trial, prison reform, reintegration of former prisoners into the community and the role of the media in justice.
