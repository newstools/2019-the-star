I mean you have to love Jesus kabisa. I mean my ideal woman has to be focused and she has to be fun, meeeeeen, I love fun meeeeeen. I also need her brain to be up there.” Moji told Massawe on Friday, “I will be marrying soon and I don’t want people to know her for now.” He said the wives and girlfriends of some of his friends in the industry have been affected by fame. “I don’t want my lover to be trolled online because of my fame,” he said. Moji said he will not post pictures of his girlfriend on social media because he has learnt from his friends that social media relationships don’t end well.
