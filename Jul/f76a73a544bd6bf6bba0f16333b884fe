Striker Mauro Icardi has left Inter Milan’s pre-season camp by mutual consent and will play no part in the pre-season tour of Asia, ahead of a likely messy departure from the San Siro. Former club captain Icardi has fallen out with chiefs at the club and is understood to have been told by new manager Antonio Conte that he does not feature in plans and is up for sale. The player’s wife-cum-agent Wanda Nara has been hawking her husband around top European clubs and has held talks with Juventus this summer. “Mauro Icardi will today return to Milan from our training camp in Lugano,” read a statement on Inter’s official website. “The club and the striker have come to this decision by mutual agreement. Icardi will continue his pre-season training over the next few days and will take no part in our Summer Tour in Asia.” Inter have slapped a €60m (£53m) price-tag on the forward, which is half the €120m figure they wanted for him a year ago. Conte is also understood to be ready move on midfielder Radja Nainggolan, who only joined the club last year from Roma. In order to not deny both players their right to work, Inter have asked them to train alone and work with personal fitness staff rather than participate in tactical drills. As a result, Icardi asked to leave the club camp which Inter granted. Conte wanted both Romelu Lukaku and fellow target Edin Dzeko signed for Inter by now, but both deals appear to be a long way off. United even turned down both Icardi and Nainggolan in part-exchange deals for the Belgian striker. United are willing to sell Lukaku, but want their valuation met by the Italian giants before sanctioning a move.
