 Vihiga Senator George Khaniri will take on William Ruto in the 2022 presidential race if Musalia Mudavadi and Raila Odinga are not ready to challenge the Deputy President. Speaking in Emuhaya on Sunday, the senator said he was ready to vie for the top seat. “By 9 in the morning, I will be escorting DP Ruto and his supporters to Sugoi,” Khaniri said referring to Ruto's home in Uasin Gishu. He said those in Tangatanga were being driven by selfish interests and not those of the Luhya community. Khaniri said it was time for another community to become president, saying only two tribes have occupied the country's top office since independence. “Why should I support another community to assent in power when we have not tested that power?” he said. The senator was speaking at Emuchula PAG Church in West Bunyore ward where he attended a service. He urged communities that have been in power to allow others to also lead the country. "This has made other communities fill like they are sidelined in the leadership of this country,” Khaniri said. He said the Luhya community has failed to use its numbers to win the presidency. He urged community leaders to unite if they want to ascend to power. “Why should we be selling our votes to other communities for food only?” Khaniri asked leaders to work to improve the lives of their electorate. “Leave a positive impact to those voters when you are elected as a leader,” he said.  edited by peter obuya
