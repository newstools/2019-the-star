Western Stima coach Salim Babu says the team is ready for the 2019-2020 Kenyan Premier League season. “There is a tremendous improvement from the day we began our pre-season. I can now confidently say I have a team ready for the season,” said Babu. The power men start their campaign on August 30 against Kariobangi Sharks at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. A confident Babu added: “So far we have had a very good pre-season. Despite losing some players, we have replaced them with equally good players.” Those who left are defender Maurice Ojwang and striker Kennedy Otieno — popularly known as Agogo — who joined KPL defending champions Gor Mahia. He further said that unlike last season when the team narrowly missed the drop by a whisker, they are targeting a top 10 finish this season. Stima have recruited heavily bringing in Augustine Kuta from Nairobi City Stars, Kisumu Day prodigy Benson Omalla, Hassan Kitoyo, Sudi Salim and Ugandan Robert Achema, Kennedy Odhiambo, Abdalla Wankuru, John Njau and Kevin Wasongar, Ibrahim Ochieng (Kisumu Hot Stars), Henry Juma and Fidel Origa (Kariobangi Sharks), Amos Kigadi (Vihiga United) and Villa Oromchan from Bidco United. Ten players among them veteran striker Wesley Kemboi were released.
