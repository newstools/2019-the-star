Boda boda operators are set to benefit from a new partnership between Total Kenya and Bajaj Auto to improve their daily operations. The two firms have entered an agreement that will see motorcycle operators get the most out of their tools of trade by reducing operational and maintenance costs. According to the Motorcycle Assemblers Association of Kenya (MAAK), there are an estimated 800,000 motorcycles in the country. Each estimated to be making an average of Sh1,000 a day, a multi-billion industry. The two firms have introduced Total Hi-Perf-Bajaj, a lubricant targeting two and three-wheelers that will be produced locally in Total Kenya’s Mombasa based blending plant. “The partnership offers an enhanced after- sale service by availing a product with superior technical capability demanded in the target segment,” Total Kenya managing director Olagoke Aluko said during the launch. He said the lubricant’s formulation will benefit motorcyclists owing to longer service intervals, which translate to reduced running costs. Currently, the majority of boda-boda riders consume 12 litres of lubricant per annum per unit. Aluko said following a successful pilot launch of the lubricant in Kenya, a co-branded similar project is set to be unveiled in 15 other African countries.
