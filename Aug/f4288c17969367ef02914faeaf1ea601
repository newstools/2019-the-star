Wyre The Love Child is working on an album with refugees in Kakuma with Film aid Kenya. Wyre says he took a break from music after he noticed the uniqueness of the talents in the camps. "Two years ago I visited Kakuma and realised there was a lot of talents who performed there and decided I would help them shine out there," he told Word Is on Thursday. Mercy Akuot (South Sudan) and Kendrick Ebei aka Scoobylincos (Turkana) both from Kakuma have been working under a project by Wyre and FilmAid, “Making Stars-Kakuma”."I came up with the project and went there to scout for talent and doing a small workshop for the artiste. Now the two have released an album and an EP and everything is ready. In support of the project, Wyre is partnering with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR. "I have also been featured in the album and soon the whole project will be out," he said. The last song he released was Wanilinda', where he was thanking God that left his fans are asking if he decided to jump on the gospel train."It's just but putting on pen and paper my feelings, but you never know," Wyre said.
