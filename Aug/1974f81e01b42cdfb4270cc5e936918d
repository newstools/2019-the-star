EatOut recently partnered with Visa to bring the 2019 edition launch of the famed Burger Week at the Brew Bistro and Lounge Rooftop. Over 80 restaurants across Nairobi and Mombasa came together to feature exciting 2-for-1 burger deals as well as ‘Burger+Drink’ combo meals. All burger lovers had to do is download the EatOut app to view participating restaurants and pay with their Visa cards to redeem their Burger Week offers. This year’s edition was the fourth. Since 2016, the event has grown to feature over 50,000 diners making their way to participating restaurants to grab a bite of their favourite patty-packed (or veggie-based) dish.
