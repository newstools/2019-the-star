Footballer Macdonald Mariga is among the aspirants in the upcoming Kibra by-election, party secretary general Raphael Tuju has confirmed. In a statement on Monday, Tuju listed Morris Peter Kinyanjui, Walter Trenk, Said Ibrahim and Doreen Wasike as other aspirants. The Kibra constituency by-election is scheduled forÂ  November 7. The seat fell vacant after the death of Ken Okoth on July 26 after a battle with cancer. Kinyanjui was a Kibra MP aspirant in 2017 while Ibrahim was the TNA candidate in 2013. Trenk, who ran for senator under UDP, took the IEBC to court in 2017 for refusing to take his nomination papers. Trenk's case was dismissed as an abuse of the court process. Wasike had been chosen as the Jubilee candidate for Kibra in 2017.
