Manchester City have categorically dismissed Jurgen Klopp’s claim that the Premier League champions live in a transfer ‘fantasy land’. The Liverpool manager namechecked City alongside Barcelona, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain as a club who can constantly throw exorbitant finance at success last weekend. City’s chief operating officer Omar Berrada rubbished Klopp’s assertions just days before the title rivals meet in the Community Shield at Wembley. “We were a little bit surprised,” Berrada said. “I don’t know why they would make these comments. I don’t know why they would look at other clubs. It’s not frustration or anger, we just find it curious that they’d be highlighting our spending. We’re fine with their spending.” Klopp, who has not made a senior signing this summer, added he was not criticising the financial muscle of Liverpool’s competitors. City broke their transfer record by landing Rodri from Atletico Madrid for £62.8m, the Spain international seen as a long-term replacement for Fernandinho. Liverpool’s net spend came in at £127m last year, while City’s was £22m. Deloitte’s latest annual review, using data from 2017-2018, calculated Manchester United’s annual wage bill is the highest in the league at £296m. Liverpool’s stood at £264m, with City at £260m. Pep Guardiola chose to revamp his squad in 2017 with the captures of Ederson, Benjamin Mendy, Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva. “The reality is that all the top clubs invest as they see fit,” Berrada added. “We don’t look at what others do. Liverpool are a great sporting rival.”
