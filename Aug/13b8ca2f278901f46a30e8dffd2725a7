Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has abandoned plans for a warm-weather training camp in a bid to keep his players fresh for another title tilt this season. According to The Sun, the reigning champions had pencilled in the camp during an eight-day free period between their clashes with Tottenham and Bournemouth. But Guardiola now believes that training at City’s Etihad Campus would instead be more beneficial for his squad. The Spanish tactician had explored the possibility of his side facing one of Girona’s teams in a friendly clash behind closed doors. But it is believed he has axed the plans over concerns surrounding the effects a gruelling summer had taken on some of City’s squad. Guardiola had afforded extended holidays for players returning from duty at the Uefa Nations League, Copa America and Africa Cup of Nations but still thinks certain members of his squad are in need of a recharge. The top flight title holders had embarked on pre-season tours to China and Japan last month, and were also part of the Premier League Asia Trophy — which ended in a penalty shootout defeat against Wolves in the final. Although City have started the new season in impressive fashion, despite dropping points against Tottenham, the Premier League’s earlier return this year has resulted in players currently still battling for fitness. Jurgen Klopp is among a group of managers who are adamant that their squads haven’t received an adequate amount of time to recover from their exertions last season.
