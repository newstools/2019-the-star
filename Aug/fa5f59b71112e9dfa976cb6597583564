The Ministry of Labour has been accused of neglecting labour complaints of youths working in supermarkets and other private companies in Migori town. Youths lament low pay, overworking and lack of leave days. They say the labour officials have failed to act against rogue employers who are taking advantage of their plight to pay them peanuts. Elvis Paul Okeyo, a youth said some supermarkets in Migori pay workers meagre salaries as casuals and never pay for overtime yet they close late at night. “Most of the employees working in informal sectors are underpaid. We even go to work early as 7am in the morning and leave for home has late as 9pm without any overtime,” Okeyo said. He said workers toil for close to ten hours a day but are paid a paltry Sh4,000 a month. “Most never sign any contract, are forced to work without a break and their complaints to labour offices have failed,” Okeyo, a youth leader, said on Friday. But Migori and Homa Bay counties labour officer Dismus Okumu said they have been investigating the claims, but most youths have refused to come out and have the issue addressed. Okumu said most don’t have unions and are afraid of speaking, despite their rights being trampled on. “We are asking them to report any cases of harassment by their bosses so that they can get help,” he said. Okumu said the ministry has partnered with the National Industrial Training Authority to publish regulations on labour relations to employers.
