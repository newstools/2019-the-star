Classic FM's Maina Kageni has finally revealed that his favourite Kenyan song is ‘Queen B' by Sailors. This comes after fans asked him to play them 'Wamlambez', which is also by Sailors. "My favourite song is ‘Queen B’ by Sailors, it’s what I am currently playing in my car," he said during his Breakfast Show yesterday. Maina has in the past been criticised for his love of Tanzanian music, with some arguing that he favours Diamond Platnumz and his WCB crew.
