A Tigania Central village is mourning the death of 16-year-old boy who fell from a mango tree a few days ago. Fredrick Kimathi Gichunge, a class seven pupil at Ngare Primary School, was pronounced dead on arrival at Marimanti Level Four Hospital. Gichunge, who was buried on Thursday, had climbed the tree to pick ripe fruits. Pastors Stephen Kiragu and Sabastian Karithi asked residents to live in peace, unity and to pray for each other.
