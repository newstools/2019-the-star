Deputy President William Ruto has dismissed political movement that is likely to be brought by the Building Bridhes Initiative report. The DP on Tuesday said through Twitter that Jubilee party will not accept 'threats' being caused by individuals calling for a 'divisive winners, losers debate on BBI'. "We will encourage sober, inclusive and objective citizen conversation on all proposals to ensure to ensure the views of all Kenyans count so to create a win-win," Ruto said. His comments come following opposition leader Raila Odinga's comments that  those who oppose the BBI report will face a humiliating defeat. Raila had described the looming public vote as a tsunami. Raila said Ruto and his Tangatanga brigade will be swept away by the political storm and dumped into the sea. “I have looked at the sky and seen clouds,” Raila said during ODM's weekend rally in Kibra. “It (the clouds) is a sign that the rains will soon start pounding. There are winds, strong winds moving from East to West and North to South. It will carry all the rubbish of Tangatanga to the sea.”
