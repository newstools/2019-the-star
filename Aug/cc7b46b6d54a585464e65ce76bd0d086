Newly-acquired KCB striker Stephen Onyango has vowed to break Boniface Ambani’s 13-year old Kenyan Premier League goal-scoring record in a season when he makes his top-flight bow this weekend. Onyango who was poached from National Super League side Fortune Sacco reckons that despite his lack of KPL football experience, he will punch above his weight and break the 26 goal record set in 2006 by Ambani while featuring for Tusker. The lanky forward netted 20 goals last season to finish as the runner up in the second tier scoring charts behind Dennis Oalo prompting the bankers to rope in his services and in his maiden season, he has set a target of scoring more than 26 league goals. "I value playing time a lot and in each and every minute which the coach will give me, I will ensure it counts. I have a target of breaking the highest goal-scoring record in the league in my first season. It’s possible through hard work and taking playing time seriously." The former Kenya Methodist University player says he is not afraid of competition for playing time from the rest of the experienced players who include former Sofapaka captain Stephen Waruru. Onyango will also muscle for a starting berth with former Sony Sugar captain Enock Agwanda, former Leopards forward Ezekiel Odera and Benson Amianda who plied his trade with Ushuru before joining the bankers. "I have no reason to worry of playing time as we are all eyeing to make it to the starting team.No one is assured but I know I will be able to prove something and cement a place in the first eleven." Meanwhile, Ambani has committed to fete any player who will break his record. "I am happy when I hear strikers are on the mission to break my record. It shows they have accepted the challenge and I promise to buy anyone who will break my record a golden boot apart from the one given by league organisers."
