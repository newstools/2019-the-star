 Wajir leaders have called for a campaign to sensitise residents on the deadline for disposing of old notes to shield them from losses. They want the campaign conducted through FM stations and grassroots leaders. Governor Mohamed Abdi, Senator Abdullahi Ali and Wajir East MP Rashid Kassim on Thursday said everybody should be made aware of the September 31 deadline for the old Sh1,000 notes. They said many people, especially those in rural areas were not aware of the ongoing phase-out of the old notes. They were speaking at the Wajir ICT Centre in a meeting with Central Bank of Kenya Governor Patrick Njoroge. The CBK boss was on a mission to publicise the new Sh1,000 notes and inform the public about the deadline for phasing out the old notes. “You will be surprised that a big population of our people are not aware of some the new notes. It sounds like you communicating to them in a foreign language when you talk of deadlines and new notes. They are simply not aware,” Abdi told Njoroge. “We wouldn’t wish to see our people lose their hard-earned cash because of lack of sensitisation,” the governor said. Kassim said news on the phase-out of the old notes had not reached herders and those in remote areas. 'Pastoralism is the backbone of our economy but most people don't operate bank accounts. They instead prefer platforms like M-Pesa," Kassim said. The leaders condemned lack of title deeds, saying it was blocking many residents from accessing loans from banks. “We are requesting that our small-scale traders be allowed to use allotment letters as collateral as we process the issuance of title deeds," Abdi said. Njoroge said he will work closely with counties to publicise the new notes, reiterating that the deadline will not be extended. He said the CBK was working on regulations to be sent to Parliament for approval to allow microfinance players to give sharia-compliant products to the Muslims who don't take loans.
