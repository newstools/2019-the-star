Fiorentina are plotting a move for Manchester United flop Fred before the Serie A transfer window closes on September 2, according to La Nazione. The Italian media outlet claims the Red Devils are willing to let the midfielder leave for 30million euros, almost half of the £52m paid to sign him from Shakhtar Donetsk last summer. The report suggests Fiorentina sporting director Daniele Prade has made the Brazilian his priority and the Serie A club have entered negotiations with United. Fred has produced one goal and one assist in 25 appearances for United, making just 13 Premier League starts. The 26-year-old is yet to feature for the Red Devils this season and is yet to be included in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s matchday squad.  Fiorentina got off to a disappointing start in their first league game of the season, losing 4-3 against Napoli at Artemio Franchi Stadium.
