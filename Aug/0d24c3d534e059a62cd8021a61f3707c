Detectives in Konoin, Bomet have launched a manhunt of a 28-year-old man who hacked to death his two children on Friday night after a dispute over a 4-kg bale of unga with his wife. The suspect identified as Peter Lang'at, a casual labourer at Siomo tea factory, is said to have hacked his son and a stepson aged four and six years respectively in the 10 pm incident at their Cheptalal home village before fleeing. Konoin subcounty Police Commander Alex Shikondi who confirmed the incident said the suspect returned home from work in the evening with the flour and ordered his wife not to prepare any meal with until she also provided a similar quantity. The wife, Shikondi said, ignored the directive and went ahead to prepare the dinner since the husband had left. He noted that the man suspected his wife who is an ECD teacher could be moving out with another man hence his decision to order her to equally provide for the family. "The suspect has warned the wife that she was playing with his earnings so as to move out with another able man. He warned her not to prepare any food until she also raised the same portion and that if she dared then he would kill them," the police boss said. Upon his return, Lang'at did not find anyone in the house and proceeded to his brother's home with a panga. It is then that he stormed the house and hacked the two children as the wife fled to safety. The two were rushed to Cheptalal Hospital where they were pronounced dead on arrival. Their bodies were moved to Kapkatet Hospital morgue. The suspect was arrested by officers who have been pursuing him. According to the Konoin police boss, he was nabbed at Mogogosiek town while armed with the killer weapon. He has been placed in custody as investigations continue.
