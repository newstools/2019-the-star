The national women’s team Harambee Starlets is hoping to take advantage of their away goal as they host Malawi in a 2020 Olympic qualifier second leg match at the Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos tomorrow. David Ouma's charges succumbed to Malawi 3-2 away on Wednesday in Blantyre. The team arrived back in the country yesterday and headed to the camp in Machakos where they are expected to hold light training today ahead of the clash which will be played behind closed doors. Ouma, who was not on the touchline in the second half of the match where the hosts had taken a 3-1 having smashed a changing room door glass in protest against a penalty given to She Flames, remained optimistic of his charges turning the tables against the visitors. He said: “If we can get two goals in Malawi, definitely at our backyard we can do better. I must congratulate my players for putting up a strong fight especially in the second half.” “We will try to build confidence in the players to win it in Machakos since we have an away goal head start. We just need to keep it tight at the back and I am confident we can go through to the next round.” His opposite number Abel Mkandawire was quoted on the Malawi Sports website saying he was unmoved by his side conceding twice at home. “We will be out to finish what we started at home. If anything, our team plays well away,” noted Kandawire, whose charges were scheduled to arrive in the country yesterday evening. Should Starlets pass the Malawi test, they will have either of Ghana or Gabon in the third round of the qualifiers.
