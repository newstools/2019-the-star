Televangelist James Ng’ang’a of Neno Evangelism Centre on Monday apologised to Citizen TV journalist Linus Kaikai. The televangelist apologised in front of Chief Magistrate Patricia Gichohi at the Kiambu Law Courts over death threats targetted at Kaikai in March. "I am asking for your forgiveness Mr Kaikai,  I didn't mean that... I am sorry for that," Ng'ang'a said. In a tweet, the Director of Strategy and Innovation at Royal Media Services acknowledged the apology and accepted it. "I have today forgiven Pastor James Ng’ang’a of Neno Evangelism for the threats to my life in March this year,"Kaikai said. Ng'ang'a  was charged with threatening to kill the Citizen TV journalist in March. He was also charged with incitement to violence and disobedience of the law. The magistrate ordered him to be released on a cash bail of Sh200,000. This was after Kaikai had complained he felt threatened by video footage that the pastor had produced attacking him. Kaikai, who is a panellist on the Citizen TV news show News Gang, went viral with his call to regulate pastors whom he called spiritual fraudsters profiting off unsuspecting Kenyans.
