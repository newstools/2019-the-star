The mayor of Somalia's capital Mogadishu, who was a former Labour councillor, has died after being wounded in a suicide attack that killed at least six other people last week. The female bomber blew herself up inside the office of Mayor Abdirahman Omar Osman during a security meeting. The mayor passed away from his injuries in Doha, Qatar, where he was receiving treatment. Militant Islamist group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack. Its apparent target was the new UN special envoy to Somalia, James Swan, a US citizen. Mr Swan had already left the building after meeting the mayor on 24 July. It is unclear how the bomber managed to enter the heavily guarded building. Other victims included high-ranking local officials. Who was the mayor? Osman fled Somalia in the early 1990s and went on to earn a master's degree and UK citizenship, and served as a Labour councillor in London. He later returned to Somalia in an effort to help re-build his war-torn homeland and served as information minister before becoming mayor of Mogadishu last year. In a tweet, the US mission to Somalia called Osman "an excellent partner and tireless advocate for the people of Mogadishu and all Somalis". Al-Shabab seeks to overthrow Somalia's central government and has been carrying out regular attacks in Mogadishu, despite the heavy presence of African Union peacekeepers and US-trained Somali troops. The group is affiliated with al-Qaeda and remains a powerful presence in rural Somalia.
