Nyashinski, Sauti Sol and Khaligraph are among Kenyan artistes who are in the 2019 Afrima nominations list. Speaking on the release of the 6th Afrima final Nominees' List, Delani Makhalima, a member of the International Jury of Afrima representing Southern Africa, said, "As with each year, the musicians never cease to amaze us with their incredible talent." Leading the sixth Afrima nominations scorecard is South Africa's Nasty C with nine nominations and Davido with six nominations. Other artistes with multiple nominations include Diamond Platnumz, who accrued four nominations, and upcoming Kenyan artistes like Olivia Ambani, whose recent project is under Empawa, a project by Mr Eazi. "As jurors, we are impressed with the quality of work being produced," Delani said. "We are confident that the nominees' list presented this year is a true reflection of world-class African talent, and each year it gets harder and harder to judge and grade the standard, as all regions on the African continent continue to surprise us by what we see and hear." Music lovers and fans are growing in record numbers to support the music. "We are enthusiastic to see this wave of appreciation transcend across the border and overseas," Delani said. The juror encouraged more musicians, songwriters and producers to keep submitting and spreading the word of Afrima so they can celebrate together the progress and pinnacles of where African music is reaching.
