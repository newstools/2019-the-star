Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion on Monday hit out at TSC for backtracking on the 2016 CBA. He accused the TSC of discriminating against teachers who are members of Knut. Sossion said the commission has made two parallel payrolls and employees are paid differently despite doing the same work. He was referring to teachers who are members of Knut versus those who are in Kuppet. Knut had gone to court to contest against the TSC's decision to implement a career progression programme, which it said hindered members from getting promotions. The career progression programme was implemented in May 2018, but the court stopped the TSC from implementing it on July 14. The TSC then went ahead to reverse salary increments implemented in the 2016 CBA. However, Sossion argued the court order only affected the career progression element, not the CBA. TSC plans to recover billions of shillings paid to the more than 190,000 Knut members two years ago when the Sh54 billion salary increment was implemented. "It is unfair for TSC to vent their bitterness through the payroll... teachers are not street or casual employees. There are clear guidelines," Sossion said. He said the teachers' CBA is anchored in the Constitution. On Saturday, Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli condemned the TSC over the move to recover the funds through a pay cut. He said this amounted to impunity, was illegal and unconstitutional. TSC refused to deduct and remit Sh140 million monthly union dues. Atwoli said the International Labour Organisation Convention 95 on Protection of Wages of 1949, the Employment Act Part IV on Protection of Wages and the 2010 Constitution Article 41 state that no one can arbitrarily reduce an employee's wage without his or her consent.
