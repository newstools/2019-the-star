 An additional 60 enumerators were on Friday deployed to Balambala constituency, Garissa, following a High Court order. “This is a court order and as a committee mandated to oversee this year’s population and housing census in the county we had no option but to comply with it,” county commissioner Meru Mwangi said. The additional enumerators were drawn from "reserves" and those who have completed the headcount in their assigned areas. The national exercise ends on Saturday, August 31. Balambala MP Abdi Shurie sought the court's intervention so that the Kenya National of Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) is ordered to deploy the additional enumerators to carry out the census in the area. Justice J.A. Makau of the Constitutional and Human Rights court on Wednesday after directed KNBS to deploy 60 additional enumerators to the constituency. The KNBS should ensure all residents, including the pastoralists, are enumerated by August 31. Sources said that between 70 and 75 per cent of Balambala constituents had been enumerated by Friday.
