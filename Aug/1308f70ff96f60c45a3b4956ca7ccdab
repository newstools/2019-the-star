Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura's wife, Nelius Mukami, was on Monday ordered to pay a fine of over Sh20,000 for driving a car without insurance and without a licence. Mukami appeared before Milimani Traffic Court magistrate Electer Rianyi and pleaded guilty to offences. She was charged when found driving a Toyota Prado at Globe Cinema, Nairobi, without insurance against third party risks. She also faced another count of using a public road without carrying a driver's licence. Mukami while pleading guilty told the Court that she forgot her driving  licence at home. The magistrate ordered her to pay a fine of Sh 20,000 or serve a four-month jail term for the first count. On the second count, she was ordered to pay a Sh1,000 fine or serve a  one-month jail term. Mwaura went to Milimani law courts to bail out his wife.
