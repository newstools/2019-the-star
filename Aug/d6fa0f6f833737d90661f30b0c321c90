On the losing efforts, Vincent Gichamba notched in three as Salim and Paul Nyambute accounted for two goals apiece. Patrick Muya, the KSF president said match between Y Lagoons and Masters is part of Kenya's build-up ahead of CANA Zone III demonstration game in October. “Uganda is way ahead of us and we want to establish water polo in the country then go regional before venturing into the continental stage where there are countries which are already established,” Muya said. Gichamba, who is also a water polo coach and founder of Y Lagoons said KSF are looking to install a league but they are starting with friendly matches. “When we get at least six teams committed to the game we will commence a league as soon as October but for now we are playing friendly matches,” Gichamba said.
