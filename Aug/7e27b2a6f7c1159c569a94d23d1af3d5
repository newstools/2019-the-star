Umoja I residents have deplored an overflow of sewage caused by burst pipes. Parts of the estate are now full of filth and a contractor hired by the Kenya National Highway Authority to dual Kangundo Road has been blamed for the problem. The contractor has, however, denied wrongdoing. The waste is a health hazard. It flows freely right to residents’ doorsteps and could lead to a disease outbreak if no swift measures are taken to fix the situation. “The odour is too much that we can’t open windows ... and the greenish colour is proof that the water is contaminated,” Njenga Wanjohi said. Another resident, Mwihaki Njogu, said, “Our children can’t play freely outside because the water has run through the estate. The playgrounds are covered in dirty water.” Umoja I MCA Mark Mugambi yesterday told the Star the upgrade works on Kangundo road had blocked drains. “Due to the ongoing digging and other works going on along Kangundo Road, some of the sewerage pipes are blocked, hence there’s no flow to the mainline. As a result, the water overflows from the pipes to the estate,” he said. Mugambi added, however, that the contractor told him he had skipped the area in question because of encroachment by mechanics who own garages along the road. “I’ve engaged the contractor to have the blocked part excavated to allow the flow of the sewage. I’ve also engaged Nairobi Water to find a way of sorting out the mess.” The ward representative condemned the disposal of solid waste in the pipes. “People should be mindful of what they put in the pipes because it interferes with water flow. No solid waste should be put in the pipes to prevent blockage,” he said. Kenha plans to complete the Umoja I-Total roundabout, which is part of the Kangundo Road, in three months. It is 60 per cent complete. Meanwhile, the works have led to heavy traffic jams on the route. (Edited by F'Orieny)
