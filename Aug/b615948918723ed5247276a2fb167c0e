New signing Nainagwe Mwaipopo from Simba FC will make her debut for the Football Kenya Federation women's Premier League leaders Gaspo when they play bottom-placed Kayole Starlet at the  Ruiru Grounds tomorrow. While Gaspo will be out to extend their lead on the standings to 52 points from 19 matches, Kayole, has four points from  17 matches, will be in search of their first win of the season. Gaspo coach Isaac Maluki said as much as their opponents are beatable on paper, they will not be complacent. "The game looks effortless on paper but having faced them a number of times, it will not be an easy match. With new induction to the team and with the experience of the other players we are hopeful of a good performance," noted Maluki. The official was happy with the return of Sheryl Angachi who missed the previous match as she was banned for misconduct.
