Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa on Wednesday evening tweeted on receiving 30,000 bags of rice from China as relief food in 23 drought-affected counties and this set tongues wagging on Twitter. "Just received a donation of 30,000bags of rice from The People’s Republic of China to compliment GOK relief food distribution in 23 drought-affected Counties," the tweet read. China’s generous gesture, however, did not sit well with majority of Kenyans. They argued that China has become the new face of neocolonialism in Kenya and rebuked the state for receiving foreign aid from them. Twitter user Mkaazi Langata said, "Eugene Wamalwa and you are seriously happy putting this post up? How many years after independence again?" "This should not be happening over 50 years after independence. Black Africans we have failed ourselves, "Elish Bii said. "Na huskii thithi ukitweet? Ghaiii (You don't feel irked while tweeting this )"Koks Mothoni asked. "This should not be happening over 50 years after independence. Black Africans we have failed ourselves," KOT loyals tweeted. Ian Njiru and Wanyama Collins wondered how the CS would glorify relief food. "A whole CS without an iota of shame glorifying relief FOOD from china. You're embarrassing the very able and hard-working citizens you serve. This tweet is an insult to the GOK big 4 agenda. Do these people ever think?? (Thinking out loud) smh," Ian Njiru said. "This is embarrassing. I wish you did this in the dark without cameras. Relief food donation from China in Jubilees second term?" Wanyama Collins wondered. Other Kenyans questioned the authenticity of the rice. "Rice donations from China? Probably some plastics. You people have failed this nation," Whispers tweeted. User by the name Captain Alive said," Anything from China is either plastic or expired."
