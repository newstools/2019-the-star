The memorial of Vice President Michael Wamalwa Kijana was for the first time held away from his Kitale home in Trans Nzoia county. The family of the fallen icon of Luhya politics conducted a low key memorial to allow for completion of a mausoleum at Wamalwa's home. The 16th anniversary was marked by a mass celebrated by Catholic Bishop Maurice Crowley at the Immaculate Conception church in Kitale attended by friends and family.​​ Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa said the mass was devoid of political sideshows unlike in the past when the memorial provided an opportunity for politicking. “Mike was a unifying factor in his style of politics because he did not play the tribal card. He articulated his issues in the spirit of equality and justice aimed at bettering Kenya as a whole,” Wamalwa said. He called on the local leadership to emulate the deceased, saying politics should be about the content of one’s character and not on the basis of their tribal backgrounds, which only serves to polarize the country. After the service, Wamalwa led family and friends on a tour of schools named in honour of the late vice president who was described as an ardent champion of good standards of education. On August 14, a memorial service of the late champion of multi-party democracy Masinde Muliro was held at his Sibanga home in Trans Nzoia where Luhya bigwigs converged in a show of community unity.
