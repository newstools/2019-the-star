Tottenham have agreed a deal with Belgian side Club Bruges over the transfer of midfielder Victor Wanyama. The 28-year-old Kenyan, who joined Spurs from Southampton in 2016 for £11m, is set to move to the Jupiler Pro League leaders for 15m euros (£13.6m) an equivalent of shSh1.2 billion. Wanyama saw his first-team chances diminish after Harry Winks' return from injury at the start of last season. He has also faced extra competition in midfield since the signing of Tanguy Ndombele for a club record £53.8m. Defensive midfielder Wanyama is yet to play this season and made 13 Premier League appearances last term. He played 18 and 36 times respectively in the two previous top-flight campaigns.
