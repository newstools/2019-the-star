Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde has agreed to the sale of Ivan Rakitic, according to Spanish outlet AS.com. Valverde is a big fan of the Croatian midfielder but he will no longer attempt to block any potential sale if the club receive a satisfactory offer before the transfer deadline next Monday. Rakitic, aged 31, has not featured in the starting line-up for the opening two La Liga games this season. The Croatian international is under contract at the Nou Camp until 2021 but may be allowed to depart should Barcelona receive a satisfactory offer. Frenkie de Jong arrived from Ajax this summer and the Dutchman’s signing appears to signal a further reduction in Rakitic’s game-time this season. Rakitic has been linked with a swap deal involving Juventus midfielder Emre Can. But talk of an exit has become expected for Rakitic and he remains unmoved, still refusing to agitate for a move away. As cited by Marca last month, he said: “It’s a situation (the exit rumours) that I’m used to since I’m here, last year the same thing happened to me. I talked to the club and the coach and the idea is the same, and my idea is to continue with Barça, I’m open, but my idea is very clear and my intention is to continue here and continue enjoying being here because I have more years left on my contract.”
