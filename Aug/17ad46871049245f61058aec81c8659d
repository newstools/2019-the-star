A High Court judge has been reported missing by his wife. Martin Muya was reported missing by his wife Haurelia Mbulwa at Kilimani police station on Tuesday. She said her husband  had been carjacked and he failed to return home on Monday night. Muya is a sitting judge at the High Court in Bomet. Mbulwa said her husband had confirmed that he was on his way to their home on Dennis Pritt Road, Kilimani. However, he did not return home six hours later and his calls went unanswered. Through a tracking device, Muya's son Benjamin Mati was able to trace the car's location. He realised that the car was moving suspiciously from one point to another which made the family concluded that the judge had been carjacked. Details of the car were then circulated and the police on patrol were ordered to intercept it. Later the  police traced the car and  shot at the right tyre, deflating it. Upon approaching the car, Muya was found to be the only person on board and he denied that he had been carjacked. No one was injured during the incident.
