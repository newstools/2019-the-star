Kilifi MCAs on Thursday welcomed President Uhuru Kenyatta's appointment of Stephen Masha Ngoa as the acting Controller of Budget. The members of County Assembly said the Mijikenda and coastal communities were now a proud lot as they had missed out on Cabinet Secretary position for the first time since independence. The MCAs and Speaker Jimmy Kahindi appealed to the President to confirm Masha to the CoB docket. Kahindi said Masha takes his work seriously and will not disappoint Kenyans. “We thank the President for the appointment. It shows the handshake is working. We hope Your Excellency will approve his appointment because despite being a son of Kilifi he is a Kenyan,’’ he said. He called on coastal people to feel they belong to the government after the Uhuru-Raila (Odinga) handshake. Leader of majority Adamson Mwathethe said the Mijikenda did not have a CS slot except for the Chief Administrative Secretary position and felt they had been left out. Kakuyuni MCA Nixon Muramba said,  “We never believed that a boy from a remote area could reach such a position.’’ Masha is from Garashi in Magarini constituency and has been the deputy CoB. He will serve in acting capacity for 90 days following the retirement of Agnes Odhiambo this week.
