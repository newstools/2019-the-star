Census gadgets in Laikipia have failed to send data captured from residents to the headquarters in Nairobi, officials have said. They reported hitches in transmitting data collected in the field to the national server. The worst affected area is Laikipia West subcounty where 36 tablets failed to transmit the data on Saturday. Laikipia county commissioner Daniel Nyameti said the gadgets were being replaced so that the enumeration can proceed as planned. “Some gadgets failed to transmit data collected despite having been in good condition when they were tested before the start of the exercise. We are replacing them so they can be reconfigured,” Nyameti said on Monday. He said the failure was a technological hitch that was not unique to the region. “Those gadgets that fail are sent back to Kenya National Bureau of Statistics technicians in Nairobi for reconfiguration and new settings so that they can be used again.” Nyameti said the counting was going on smoothly despite the hitches. “The planners of the exercise had anticipated such challenges and therefore they ensured that all areas had extra gadgets in case those in use failed," he said. He said there were no security challenges reported so far.
