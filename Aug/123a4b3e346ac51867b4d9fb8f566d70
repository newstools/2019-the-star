Comedian Njugush has denied claims he wants to vie for a political seat. The entertainer recently posted a photo of himself on Instagram with a caption that hinted that he would be running for the presidency in 2022. "I offer my candidature for presidency in 2022! This is not the time for politicking. That's why I'm urging you all to come out in large numbers as you waste your time and resources to vote me in, I promise you, you'll always regret," it read. When Word Is reached out to him, Njugush said he was just being satirical and has no political ambitions. The popular social media influencer said he would never run for president because "power and money corrupt people". He said the politicians we have at the moment are only there to eat public resources and that his biggest regret is he voted. "I think our leaders can do better as compared to what they are doing, and I would not want to join them and see them misusing people's resources," he said. One of his biggest lessons this year is learning he had fake friends around him. "There are a lot of sacrifices that one goes into for those people. You waste your time and you even ignore your family because you need to take care of your friends," Njugush said. He said as long as someone was in his circle, he helped without a second thought, but in his experience, that generosity hasnâ€™t always been reciprocated. He said he found out who his real friends were when he was in problems.
