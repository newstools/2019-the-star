Manchester United are ready to reward defender Victor Lindelof with a double-your-money contract extension worth £150,000 a week, according to the Daily Mirror. United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants Lindelof to form a long-term central defensive partnership with £80million new signing Harry Maguire. Lindelof and Maguire formed an impressive understanding in their first outing together, Sunday’s 4-0 rout of Chelsea . The 25-year-old Sweden international, a £30m signing from Benfica in 2017, has recovered after a shaky start to his Old Trafford career and was courted by Barcelona this summer. Lindelof has two years left on his current £75,000-a-week deal, with an option for an extra 12 months. United are ready to offer Lindelof a three year extension worth £150,000-a-week that would keep him at Old Trafford until 2025.
