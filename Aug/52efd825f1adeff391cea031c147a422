Frank Lampard has bemoaned Chelsea’s narrow Uefa Super Cup defeat by Liverpool on Wednesday night and expressed his unhappiness at the fact that Jurgen Klopp’s side had two extra days to prepare. Chelsea were a far cry from the side who were humbled by a ruthless Manchester United on Sunday and for long spells looked the better side in Istanbul. The match ultimately went down to the lottery of a shootout, and Lampard admitted it had been hard for his side to take the defeat but added that he had seen plenty of positives in the performance. He said: “I’m the worst loser in the world and I hate it. The way they played, the spirit, the desire, the quality. I know we lost and that’s it but (we take) confidence for the season. We have got real quality in there. Sometimes football is little moments of luck.” Lampard, whose side were the better team for large chunks of the game, hailed his team - but admitted he wasn’t happy with the fact Liverpool were afforded two days extra preparation time for the clash here in Turkey. Liverpool played at home against Norwich on Friday night whereas Chelsea travelled to Manchester United on Sunday afternoon And Lampard added: “I don’t want to look like I’m moaning but it clearly affects preparation, it’s unfortunate they have two day extra recovery. I respect Liverpool, but I felt we were the stronger team. I’m a terrible loser but the feeling for me is one of pride.” “If we keep playing like that then we’ll be okay. I saw a lot of things I want to see.” Andreas Christensen was forced off with a tight groin but Chelsea are hopeful the problem isn’t serious.
