Neymar’s move to Barcelona is on the brink of collapse after Ousmane Dembele’s agent said his player wouldn’t be leaving the Nou Camp. Paris Saint-Germain wanted Dembele included in a deal that would see Neymar return to Barcelona. But Moussa Sissoko, Dembele’s agent, says the 22-year-old won’t be going anywhere. “He is staying 100 per cent.” “There is no chance he will leave,” Sissoko told Telefoot. “He wants to win at Barca.” Dembele’s time at Barcelona, since joining from Borussia Dortmund in 2017, has been heavily affected by injury. While he scored 14 times for Barcelona last season, he only managed to make 20 starts in La Liga.
