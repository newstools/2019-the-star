The widow of the late Kibra MP Ken Okoth, Monica, should be inherited by the legislator's elder brother, Luo elders have said. Luo Council of Elders Chairman Nyandiko Ongadi in a phone call interview with the Star said that Monica should be inherited by one of Okoth’s elder brothers. “It’s upon any of the Okoth’s elder brother interested to inherit her. Should there be no brother then a close elder relative can do the same to fulfill the Luo cultural rites,” Ongadi said. After Monica is inherited, the elder brother or relative should build her a house(simba). The elders are calling upon, Okoth's European wife to visit Okoths native home in Kasawe, Homabay for HIV and STI testing. "If truly Monica is Okoth's wife she should honor the community's culture and practices," he said. The elder also said Monica should visit her husband’s home to perform certain rituals together with the family. “The rituals like eating together with the family of her husband at home are necessary. The family should symbolically bury a banana log at the home,” Ongadi said. The MP’s mother Angeline Ajwang’ is expected to issue a statement on the cultural rites when she returns home from Nairobi. Okoth succumbed to colorectal cancer on Friday last week at the Nairobi Hospital. His body was cremated on Saturday morning in Nairobi.
