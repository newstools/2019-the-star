Vera Sidika has responded to criticism for allegedly dressing inappropriately during Diamond and Tanasha Donna's baby shower last week. Her costume was described as a 'mosquito net'. Diamond's sister Esma said, "We are normally told every day to be keen and be prepared to have a mosquito net beforehand. Today I met someone who had worn a mosquito net to the function, even though there were no mosquitos at the function." Vera has now come out to defend her choice of attire. She shared a photo on Instagram in which she was skimpily dressed, accompanied by the message, "Donâ€™t be afraid to be different, be afraid of being the same as everyone else."
