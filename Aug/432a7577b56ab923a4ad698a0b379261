Everton’s class finally told as they overcame a brave Lincoln City side thanks to late goals from Alex Iwobi and Richarlison. Danny Cowley’s men made a flying start, taking the lead from the game’s opening attack. Midfielder Jack Payne raced into the Everton box and picked out Harry Anderson who fired into the top corner to send Sincil Bank wild. It didn’t take long for Everton to respond as Gylfi Sigurdsson fired wide from distance two minutes later. The Icelandic international saw another saved by Grant Smith, leading to a series of corners that Lincoln did well to defend. Everton levelled the scores through Lucas Digne’s superb free kick that found the top corner from 30 yards. Lincoln tried to hit straight back but it was Everton who continued to look more dangerous as Kean, the former Juventus striker, rattled the post. The Everton pressure continued almost unabated after the interval and just before the hour the visitors got their reward. Michael O’Connor sent Morgan Schneiderlin tumbling in the box and Sigurdsson made no mistake from the spot. But Andrade levelled the scores shortly after with a vicious volley before the late show from Iwobi and Richarlison put the tie beyond doubt. “I thought it was a really good game and a good advert for the competition. I’m proud Everton brought the team they did and showed us the respect they did,” said Cowley.
