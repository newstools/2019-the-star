Diabetes and high blood pressure diseases diagnosed late are sending many Kitui residents to an early grave,  a Nairobi businessman has said. Country Clock Kenya Limited proprietor Paul Mutemi called on the Kitui county government to carry out public awareness to curb the noncommunicable diseases mostly affecting persons aged over 40 years. “Many of our people realise that they suffer from diabetes or high blood pressure when the illness is at a very advanced level. In such cases there is very little a medic can do to help them,” he said. Mutemi spoke  to reporters in Kitui on Wednesday. He said during a soccer tournament and medical camp his firm sponsored in Itivanzou village in Kyuso last weekend, it was established that many sick people were unaware of their condition. During the free medical camp, 480 people were screened for diabetes and high blood pressure and 20 per cent of them were found with either condition. He said 200 people were screened for diabetes and 280 patients for high blood pressure. “HIV testing was also done on site and health talks on cancer given by the medical professionals who participated in the free medical camp,” Mutemi said. “I am calling on the county government of Kitui to carry out public health awareness where they should encourage people to go for early screening for diabetes and high blood pressure. They can even partners with us for free medical camps." He said through such initiatives the diseases could be detected at a early stage and managed with appropriate drugs to help the patients live longer. Mutemi said next August his company plans free medical camps in at least five venues  in Mwingi north subcounty of Kitui to screen  for diabetes and high blood pressure. The Afya Yangu tournaments and medical camps will focus not only sporting activities but also on health awareness. “During the tournaments the youths will be enlightened on the dangers of drugs and substance abuse,” Mutemi said.
