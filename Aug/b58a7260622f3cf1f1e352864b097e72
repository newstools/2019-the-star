For more than 23 years, tobacco has been on the public health agenda in Kenya. Through the Tobacco Act 2007, cigarette companies were banned from conducting any form of advertising of their products. However, smoking remains a leading cause of death. The state has banned smoking in public areas by creating designated areas.  Surprisingly, busy town streets, especially along bus stations, are the most affected as some individuals smoke carelessly oblivious to irritation and hazards they pose other members of the public to. Tobacco kills more than 1,200 people daily globally, making it more lethal than road accidents, natural calamities and even HIV/Aids. That’s why smokers need to quit while those not hooked should avoid smoking like a plague.
