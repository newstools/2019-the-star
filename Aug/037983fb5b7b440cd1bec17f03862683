The county government wants to reduce the cost of preaching at Uhuru Park from Sh 2,500 to Sh1,500 per hour in the Nairobi City County Finance Bill, In addition, the county will not charge lunch time preachers in Central Park, Jevanjee Gardens and Kamkunji grounds. The bill further proposes to cut the cost of clearance certificate of vendors at Uhuru and City parks from Sh10,000 to Sh2,000 per annum. The bill which is currently at public participation stage has introduced new charges on certain parks mostly used by city dwellers for recreational purposes. For video shooting, the county will charge Sh5,000 per day. For commercial video shooting, the county will charge a minimum of Sh10,000 daily. The bill also seeks to introduce new charges for music fanfare at Sh5,000 per day and this will also be applied at Central Park, Jevanjee Gardens, Kamkunji and at City Park. Vendors selling sweets, cigarettes and other items will be required to pay a daily fee of Sh100. Entertainment lovers at City Park will also feel the pinch of additional taxes.
