Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa has urged Kenyans to make devolution the centerpiece of any amendments to the Constitution. He told politicians not to politicise issues about the Constitution. “An amended Constitution is not about Ruto or Raila. It’s for posterity.  We want to see sobriety in the discourse on our Constitution,” he said. Wamalwa spoke during the burial of Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital principal nursing officer Donald Epaalat in Lupida, Nambale subcounty, on Thursday. The CS called for patience as Kenyans give their views to the Building Bridges Initiative task force. Kenyans want is a Constitution that can stand the test of time and realise the success of devolution, he said. With two days to the end of the 2019 population census, the CS urged Kenyans who have not been counted to do so, noting that knowing the size and critical features of Kenya’s population will help the country and counties plan and share resources. He said Kenya and Uganda will in the next two weeks sign an agreement among the Pokot, Turkana and Karamoja communities to end hostilities that have spanned many decades. “We want similar MoUs between the Tesos, Samias and Bukusus of Kenya and their Ugandan counterparts. The issue of artificial boundaries should be done away with. We want an integrated East African Community so that we are one East Africa,” he said. Busia Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi called for an end to road carnage in the country. On the on-going revenue funds allocation stalemate between the Senate and the National Assembly, Mulomi called for an amicable solution to restore financial normalcy in counties. The late Epaalat was the brother to Amukura Catholic Parish priest Dunstan Epaalat.
