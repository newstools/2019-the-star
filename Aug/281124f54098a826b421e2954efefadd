Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea has signed a new contract with the club, claims former No 1 Peter Schmeichel. The future of the Spain international has been uncertain for several months with him having entered the final year of his current deal at Old Trafford. But Schmeichel, who played for the club between 1991 and 1999, has eased any fears that De Gea might be on his way out by claiming an agreement to extend his contract has been reached. The United legend told The Mirror: “David was a great signal that we start off with arguably our best performer over the last five years. We have tied him down, he is staying and now we move on and build on that.” Tying down De Gea would come as a huge boost to manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as the Spaniard has been United’s best player in recent times. Schmeichel’s son Kasper, who has won the Premier League with Leicester, has previously been linked with a move to Old Trafford should De Gea leave.
