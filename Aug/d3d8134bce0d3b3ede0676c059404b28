Murang’a will establish a special enforcement unit to increase revenue collection and fight alcoholism and drug abuse. It will be headed by two ex-police officers; the positions have been advertised. Governor Mwangi Wa Iria said on Friday that members of the unit will receive basic training. “Once we create the unit, one of the heads will be in charge of the enforcement of revenue collection, the other will head the fight against drugs and substance abuse,” Wa Iria said. He spoke while distributing bursary cheques to 1,000 students. Wa Iria has adopted the idea from Kakamega county that has an elaborate enforcement unit. In July this, Wa Iria visited Kakamega's launch of a youth empowerment programme in which more than 3,000 youths. Fifty from each ward were trained and engaged in community service programmes. The youths had been trained by the county enforcement unit. Wa Iria said both counties are partnering and will conduct exchange programmes. He said the team will help control drug abuse that has increased to dangerous levels. The governor said the most efficient way of fighting drug abuse is empowering youths. He said the county already has already trained more than30,000 youths in short, free technical courses. “We have opened our polytechnics and urged youths to register for free courses," Wa Iria said. The courses will enable youths to get jobs and later advance their education. The programme that started in 2017 is targeting youths unable to advance their education after secondary school. Youths who enrol in the programme choose from 25 short courses that will enable them to become self-employed. ey include plumbing, masonry, hairdressing, dressmaking, soap making, motorbike repair, welding and food processing. The youths will then join co-operatives and the county will provide them with tools. (Edited by V. Graham)
