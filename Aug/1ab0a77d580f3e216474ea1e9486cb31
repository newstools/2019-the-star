Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko’s administration is once again on the spot over the expenditure of Sh6.8 million raised from renting county social halls. The auditor's report for financial year 2017-2018 says the city’s four social halls in Dandora and Kariobangi were hired out, meaning they earned money. "There was no evidence showing the halls had generated revenue. Money was being spent at source as there were no documents to prove the amount that was being collected during that period," an officer from the AG's office said. He said investigations showed the county government hired out the social halls for various purposes but no documents were produced indicating how much money was collected. The questions were raised on Wednesday at the county assembly during a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee. The committee headed by Wilfred Odalo was probing the executive concerning the Auditor General’s queries about lack of documents to support the Sh6, 822, 500 collected by the county government for the financial year ended June 30, 2018. Appearing before the committee, City Hall’s director of youth and sport Daniel Ngare admitted the social halls were leased and collected revenue. However, he denied the county government spent the money at source. The revenue collected from the halls was all banked into the county’s revenue accounts, Ngare said. He said the county charges different rates for the halls in accordance with the Finance Act and depending on a hall’s size. Nominated MCA Silvia Museiya questioned why the executive had not provided any documented evidence despite claiming to have it. Officers from the Auditor’s General office told the committee they had not received any documented evidence during the auditing period . Ngare explained that anyone who intends to use the halls pays through the bank. "At no point does the county collect cash. It is an illegality to do so because all the money has to be banked," he said.
