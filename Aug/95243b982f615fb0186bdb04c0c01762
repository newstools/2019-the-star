The government plans to build four mega dams to end perennial hunger and famine in the semi-arid Mbeere South region. They ate Kamumu, Thuci, Rupingaci and Thambana dams. Mbeere South MP Geoffrey Kingángí said that the government has allocated funds for the construction of Thuci dam in this financial year. The contractor is expected on the ground anytime this year. The dam will supply water to residents of Manyatta constituency and Mbeere South. Water from Mt Kenya Forest will feed the dam. Kingángí said Rupingaci dam is next in line and it will be allocated cash in the  next financial year. “After the construction of Thuci and other water project we have embarked on ,this will be a good move for Mbeere South residents as they will use that water to do irrigation. Famine will be a thing of the past,’’ King'ang'i said. The legislator said that many parts of Mbeere region are fertile only what residents lack is water for irrigation because the region does not receive adequate rainfall.
