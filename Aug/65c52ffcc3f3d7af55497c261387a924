Kenyan Art came alive last Thursday as Fairmont The Norfolk began an exciting week-long African art exhibition called, ‘African Inspiration’. It entailed cocktails and tribal art at the hotel’s sumptuous Cin Cin Lounge Bar. Guests were treated to a showcase of unique collections of rare and valuable arts curated by Lisa Christoffersen. The event aims to provide a platform for different art exhibitors to display their works and content.
