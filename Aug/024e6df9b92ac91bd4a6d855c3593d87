Kenya's Everlyne Owala put Kenya on the map after winning the coveted Women bodybuilding 2019 championship title held in Angola. Everlyne was awarded the title by The International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness (IFBB) on Saturday. In a sport that is often associated with men, she defied the odds when she quit her banking career to pursue her passion of keeping fit. According to Everlyne, she decided to keep fit in a bid to look different and achieving her life long dream. Prior to her 2019 success, the now turned proprietor of wellness and fitness club was also crowned the Ms Kenya Figure 2016 and Â Runners up 2017 Figure. Everlyne took to her Instagram handle to thank the people who helped her achieve her goal specifically to her 'better half' whom she said: "In my country, there exists good people, people like my better half who puts up with my prep sunny and dull days but still kisses me on the forehead and says, it is ok," she wrote in her post.
