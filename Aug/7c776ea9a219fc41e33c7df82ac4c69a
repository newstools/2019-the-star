‘Radio Love’ hitmaker Nadia Mukami has opened up about her past relationship, which ended through a phone call. Nadia says she wants to be closer to God, and a prayerful partner will complement that. "I am single. I am a boss lady right now I am alone," she told Word Is. She added that she is not into money, all she wants is a patient man who has something going on for themselves. Speaking about her experience, Nadia said she one day called her then-boyfriend, who did not pick but promised to call later, only for him to break her heart. "When he called back, he told me we needed to end the relationship because it was not working," she said. Nadia is promoting her new release, 'Ikamate Hiyo’.
