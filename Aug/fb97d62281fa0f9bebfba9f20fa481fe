A census enumerator who reported to work while drunk was on Friday sentenced to four months imprisonment or a fine of Sh20,000 by a Muranga court. Samson Ndirangu was also accused of misplacing the enumerating kit on August 29. The court heard that Ndirangu was found asleep in one of the houses that he was to conduct enumeration in Mukuyu market near Murang’a town. Prosecutor Edith Otieno told resident magistrate Victoria Ochanda that the suspect’s supervisor reported him missing, prompting a search. The suspect, a fourth-year student at Chuka University was found fast asleep in his girlfriend’s house. Otieno noted that the local village elder and Kenya National Bureau of Statistics officers rushed the suspect to Murang’a Level 5 Hospital where he regained consciousness after undergoing treatment. The prosecutor further told the court that the enumerator then led the officers to another woman’s house where the enumeration kit was found. After an assessment, she said, the kit was found to be in the required state. Ndirangu pleaded guilty to the charge and appealed for leniency saying he is awaiting graduation later this year. He also noted that he had already covered the area he was assigned to enumerate. The magistrate ordered the prosecution to Ndirangu at Murang’a police station as he awaits an extra charge of contravening the oath of secrecy he took when he was assigned the work. (edited by O.
