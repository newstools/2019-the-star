Atletico Madrid have been dealt a setback five days before their La Liga campaign begins with the news that striker Diego Costa has sustained a thigh injury. Atletico said in a statement yesterday that Costa had hurt his left thigh in the final minute of the teamâ€™s 2-1 friendly win over Juventus last Saturday in Stockholm, but did not say how long he would be out of action. Costa missed a large part of the last campaign due to a knee injury but has impressed during pre-season, scoring four goals in a thumping 7-3 friendly win over local rivals Real Madrid last month. According to widespread reports in the Spanish media on Tuesday, Atletico are negotiating with Valencia to sign striker Rodrigo for 60 million euros ($67 million).
