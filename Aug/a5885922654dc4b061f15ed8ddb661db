City lawyer Donald Kipkoriri has described his learned friend Miguna Miguna as a harlot The vocal city lawyer said Miguna Miguna sells his mouth to the next customer after MM who is exiled in Canada attacked opposition leader Raila Odinga. “Never understood why some Kenyans treat Miguna Miguna as a hero. Kenyan Fugitives from the Law always run to Canada because we have no extradition treaty with them,” Kipkorir said. Miguna Miguna had alleged that Raila is a blogger to tarnish his name on social media. Miguna Tweeted: “Raila is a pathetic miser, he has hired a hungry, incompetent, castrated flea-infested Kanu-era pickpocket to hurl abuse at me on social media.” The vocal lawyer in a tough reply to Miguna Miguna on Friday night said that Miguna who is in exile in Canada is a man whose sole source of livelihood is an acerbic mouth. The Star could not establish if Miguna meant Raila had hired Kipkorir to attack and blackmail him on social media.
