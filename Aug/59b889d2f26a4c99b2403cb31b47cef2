A policeman was charged with conspiracy for failing to investigate the cause of businessman Jimmy Baburam's death. Inspector Ibrahim Oruko from the DCI said sergeant Abdi Shee received money via M-Pesa from Amina Shiraz, Baburam's widow. This is against police ethics and an indication he had been compromised to conceal evidence of murder, he said. The Nairobi businessman died on a family vacation at Amani Villa, Medina Palms Resort, in Watamu, Kilifi county, on July 26, 2015. It is suspected he was murdered by his widow and American fugitive Jacob Schmalze, who is on the run but is on trial at the High Court in Mombasa. Oruko said Shee never recorded any statements from Shiraz on the circumstances of the death and recommended that his was a natural death Oruko told defence lawyer Kimani Gicheru that Shee, who was the investigation officer on the day of the murder, failed to open a file for the case assigned to him by then OCS Watamu Michael Ndonga. Oruko told the court he did not prefer charges against the OCS because Shee was assigned to handle the case. Gicheru, while cross-examining Oruko, defended his client on the M-Pesa transaction, saying the money was an Idd gift. But Oruko said police laws do not allow an officer to receive gifts. In case the gift is in monetary form it should be channelled through one's senior to the Inspector General of Police who will decide how to disburse it. "Ndonga told me that Sgt Abdi Shee came to his office and told him there was no need to record a statement because the deceased died as a result of natural death," he said, referring to the former OCS’S statement. Oruko further told the court that Shee said Amina should not be tormented as she was grieving. The investigation officer was the last prosecution witness. Shiraz and Shee were present in court. Malindi chief magistrate Julie Oseko set the case for mention on October for parties to file written submissions. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
