A court has directed the prosecution to supply the defence with copies of witness statements in a case in which businesswoman Joyce Akinyi and two others are charged with trafficking heroin worth Sh5.5 million. Senior magistrate Christine Njagi issued the order after the court was informed the prosecution had supplied some witness statements and other documents will be supplied at the next mention date on September 11. The magistrate fixed the hearing of the case on October 15. Akinyi is charged alongside her two co- accused Peris Anyango Omondi and Congolese Paulin Kalala. They are represented by city lawyers John Ogada, Dorcas Osabwa and Elvis Abenga. Akinyi and Peris Omondi were ordered released on bond of Sh2 million each with two sureties of the same amount. They must report to the police once a week and can only travel out after informing the court. Magistrate Njagi denied Congolese Paulin Kalala bail, ruling there were compelling circumstances in his case as he had no known contacts in Nairobi and investigations were also still going on. Lawyer Ogada had earlier asked that the defense be supplied with all the witness statements, documentary exhibits and inventories of property taken from the accused persons. He also asked for the release of Akinyiâ€™s car and other property which were taken by police during their arrest. Akinyi and the others are charged that on July 13, 2019, at Deep West Resort within Nairobi county, they trafficked heroine worth Sh5,588,580. Akinyi and Omondi are further charged with possessing forged Democratic Republic of Congo passports. They have denied the charges.
