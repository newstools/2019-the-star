Murang’a Woman Representative Sabina Chege says most Kenyans are seeking treatment from India because of misdiagnosis. Last week, Sabina visited gospel artiste Jimmy Gait who is currently in India for treatment. "But a majority of Kenyans are here coz of misdiagnoses, treatment is cheaper and prompt, drugs are cheaper and the level of technology is high.... more patient-focused where a doctor does not work alone but they have a team and therefore a consultation is very high," she told Word Is on Thursday. Jimmy Gait is suffering from throat complications and undergoing through several tests there to identify his problem. "His condition it’s only him who can disclose but will be tabling a report in parliament and have several laws that I will recommend and amend others," Sabina said. Through a post on his social media, Gait stated that the legislator was in India to gather information on why many Kenyans seek treatment there and how Kenya’s health sector can be improved. “Mheshimiwa Sabina Chege came to visit Kenyans who are ailing here in India,” he wrote.
