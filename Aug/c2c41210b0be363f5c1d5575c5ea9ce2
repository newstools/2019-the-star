Two people, one of them a primary school deputy headteacher, have been arrested for allegedly stealing nine digital literacy programme tablets. The Suba South school deputy headteacher was arrested on Thursday evening. He and an accomplice identified as Peter Ouma were detained at Magunga Police Station. Homa Bay County Commissioner Harman Shambi told reporters on Friday that police had recovered the tablets. “Security officers are still looking for other suspects,” Shambi said, adding that an audit of school guards would be conducted to boost security in schools. “We cannot allow a few people to scuttle the digital literacy programme because the government has invested a lot of funds in it,” he said.
