Vanice Nyagisera left race favourite Lamia Lhabz of Morocco in tears after running away with a gold medal in the 400m hurdles here at Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium here in Rabat. She clocked 56.95 seconds to win the race as Lamia trailed in second place in 56.97. Nigeria’s Abasiami Akpan finished third in 57.97. The Moroccan cried uncontrollably while the Kenyan wrapped in Kenyan flag could only afford a smile after pulling a harm-string at the end of the race. “ I can only thank God,” she said as she was stretchered to First Aid room.
