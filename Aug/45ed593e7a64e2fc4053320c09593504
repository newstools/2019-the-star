Jamaican dancehall artiste Garfield ‘Konshens’ Spence and his wife Latoya Wright have seemingly called it quits. Wright took to social media on Friday to announce that she is now a single woman via an Instagram story post. “I am a single woman so whatever Konshens does with his life has absolutely nothing to do with me,” she wrote Latoya in defense said she shared the news so Dancehall fans won’t be alarmed when Konshens begin to act like a single man, “I’m not into advertising my personal life online but  I need everyone to know this so if and when he starts with the “single man acts” then y’all know he really is single and it’s ok for him to act however he pleases.” Konshens and his longtime girlfriend Latoya Wright got married on November 2017 in a private ceremony in Miami. The dancehall veteran shared a few photos on social media from the beautiful wedding. His fans applauded him for the move and congratulated his bride and mother of his son Liam. Konshens, whose real name is Garfield Spence, and Latoya had been dating for a couple of years. In 2014, the “Realest Song” deejay popped the question and she said yes. After three years of being engaged.
