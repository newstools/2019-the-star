Edwin Soi now wants to try his luck in the 5000 metres during national trials next month as he seeks to make a cut for the next month’s World Championships in Doha Qatar. Soi, who failed to keep pace with Ethiopian rivals, placing fourth in the 10,000m, blamed his dismal show on burn out after running the National Championships last week. “ I couldn’t keep pace with the Ethiopians in the final lap because I am still fatigued after the race we ran last week,” he noted. He also defended his counterparts Charles Muneria and Paul Tanui who pulled out of the race early on. “I know they were not well and they were not even meant to run. I just requested them to do a lap for the sake of the country and they obliged," observed Soi He continued: “ He said Muneria has been sick for the last two days and has not eaten anything for the duration. Tanui, on the other hand, has an injury and there was little he could do about it,” He said he had the confidence of lifting the title was it not for the national championships that took place last week. “ I will be at the trials to try the 5000m and see whether I can hack it. I really want to be part of the Team Kenya to the global show,” he noted. He, however, clarified that h3 has had very good training and apart from the fact he ran last week, he was sure of lifting the crown.“ But now that things turned out this way, I can only focus on the next event,” he added.
