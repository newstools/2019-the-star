The county assembly of Taita Taveta has bowed to pressure to dialogue with the governor to end the ongoing stalemate between MCAs and the executive. Addressing the press on Monday in Voi, assembly speaker Meshack Maghanca said the assembly is keen in putting its differences aside. “We are taking reconciliation route because the continued stand off threatens cohesion, development and service delivery,” Speaker said. He urged Governor Granton Samboja to convene a meeting to resolve the stand off. “ We wish to call upon the governor as the head of county of Taita Taveta to speedily convene a meeting aimed at resolving this impasse,” Speaker said. They added that the hard stand off from both sides will not end challenges being faced by the people of Taita Taveta. On July 2, Samboja launched a campaign to collect signatures from residents to have the county assembly dissolved. Samboja accused MCAs of holding his administration hostage. He said the MCAs were hell-bent on looting money meant for development thus denying residents the fruits of devolution. The Executive and MCAs disagreed over Sh5.6 billion budget for 2019/20 financial year. The second term governor petitioned President Uhuru Kenyatta to dissolve the county of Taita Taveta in order to pave way for a fresh start. ODM party leader Raila Odinga met with county MCAs on Tuesday 30 who pleaded with him to mediate in their conflict with governor Samboja.
