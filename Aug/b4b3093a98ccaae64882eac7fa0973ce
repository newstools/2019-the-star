Kenya National Union of Teachers Secretary General Wilson Sossion has said the operations in the union's office will be paralysed for seven days. Sossion said on Wednesday that the union will close  its offices from August 28 to September 3 to allow staff members to make arrangements for their children as school opening day approaches. The union boss added that its action has been prompted by the financial issues in Knut. This comes as trouble continues inside the union after its top leadership demanded an urgent special meeting. They said they want to discuss issues affecting the union such as allowances and withdrawal of members. Knut postponed its National Executive Council meeting on Monday 26 which was to be held on Thursday 29th. Teachers Service Commission withheld teacher's July fees to their union, setting the stage for conflict with their lobby. Knut said teachers employer had failed to remit deductions from the more than 200,000 teachers which the union uses to operate its welfares.
