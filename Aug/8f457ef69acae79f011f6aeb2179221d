Sportpesa has been dealt a blow after the High court declined to compel the Betting Control and Licensing Board (BCLB) to renew its operational license. Justice John Mativo dismissed the case filed by Pevan trading as Sportpesa on grounds that it did not satisfy the conditions for grant of the orders sought. “There is nothing to demonstrate that there has been “an express refusal, or an implied refusal through unreasonable delay” to grant the license,” said the Judge. Mativo said Sportpesa failed to demonstrate that the impugned decision was arrived at arbitrarily and was an abuse of power. “Even if the court quashes the decision which I found there is no basis, Sportpesa cannot operate on an expired license. It will remain unable to operate for want of a license. This court cannot rewrite a contract willfully entered by the parties nor can it quash the letter from Board to open the door to them to operate without a license,” said Mativo. Sportpesa in the court case also wanted the court to compel the government to lift the suspension of their pay bill numbers. It said the suspension of their paybill numbers and short codes halted their businesses, despite meeting all the requirements and further sought damages. But the Judge declined saying Sportpesa failed to demonstrate that the Board violated its constitutional rights. “Having so found, there would be no basis for this court to award damages” Damages he said must be pleaded and proved. Sportpesa had sought for damages for loss of business and breach of its fundamental rights. But Mativo said Sportpesa never pleaded with specify the alleged loss or details to form a basis for the claim. “A claim for loss of business by its nature requires oral evidence which was not offered in this case. I am unable to locate any element of arbitrariness, malice, bad faith or abuse of power,” he said. .
