An estimated 10,000 children under the age of one in Bomet county missed vaccination against preventable diseases last year. Stephen Ikonya, an expert with Kenya Aids NGOs Consortium said Bomet was one of 16 counties nationally which missed their national immunisation targets. Ikonya said that the county's target was to immunise 34,733 children but the health department managed 23,000 complete vaccinations. “While the national target of vaccination of children against preventable diseases stood at 80 per cent, Bomet managed only 68 per cent,” Ikonya said. The vaccination rate was far lower despite the fact that access to health services was high, Ikonya said. The county has 148 immunisation centres but in most cases, parents and caregivers failed to take their children for vaccinations. Ikonya spoke in Bomet town during a one-day sensitisation workshop for health officials. The Kenya Expanded Programme on Immunisation county coordinator Josephine Mutai appealed to health workers to follow-up on defaulters. “Some caregivers default because of a simple reason like misplacing immunisation books as they fear that they will be turned away,” she said. Mutai urged health workers to ensure such cases were not allowed to happen. The coordinator appealed to the county government to engage the services of community health workers to improve the vaccination of children against preventable diseases. (edited by O. Owino)
