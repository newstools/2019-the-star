Harry Winks has told Manchester City and Liverpool they should watch out for Tottenham in the title race. Spurs have started the new Premier League season in impressive form, winning their opener and holding Manchester City to a 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday evening. While they finished fourth and 27 points behind eventual winners City last season, they also reached the Champions League final. And England international Winks believes they have the talent to challenge City and Liverpool, who were the closest contenders last time around. “I think they should worry about us,” Winks told the Evening Standard. “We’ve shown in the last few years that we can compete with the best teams in the Premier League and Europe. It’s important we do that on a consistent basis this season and it’s important we go to places like City and Liverpool and get results.” “The manager doesn’t allow fear in us. We don’t go into any game beaten mentally. We go into every game knowing we can win and we can outperform them. Our mentality going into every game is to be on the front foot, press and try to win. That’s probably why we came away with a good point.”
