Yunasi Band recently put on a great show for guests at Alliance Francaise, ahead of their album launch, which is coming soon. The band has developed a music style called Sesube, which combines Sega, Isikuti and Benga. It takes sounds and inspirations from local Kenyan communities, cultural styles and languages, and fuses those sounds with a European component. The band sings in various languages, including Swahili, English, French, Luo, Kisii and Luhya.
