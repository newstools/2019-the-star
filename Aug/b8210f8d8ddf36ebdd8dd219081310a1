Ilkay Gundogan has handed Manchester City a massive boost by agreeing to sign a new contract after protracted negotiations. The German midfielder had looked set to leave the Etihad Stadium when his current deal runs out next summer. But Gundogan, who first discussed his contract situation with City last year, is now ready to commit his future to the Premier League champions. “If you stay patient for another couple of weeks you will know – we will see,” Gundogan smiled. “Every situation is different and individual. Everyone has to take a decision for himself. These kind of decisions sometimes take a little bit of time. “During last season I asked people to be patient because it’s a decision you make for the next few years. That’s why I was calm and relaxed and still am. It’s a comfortable situation for me at the moment.” Gundogan scored in the penalty shootout as City lifted the Community Shield against Liverpool. The 28-year-old believes Liverpool will push City again. “I definitely expect the level will not drop, so I think it will increase over the next few weeks,” he added. “We are not through our preparations so both teams are not 100 per cent, but the game really showed it’s tight. “Both teams have a lot of quality and if both teams are going to improve it will be even more work to follow us two. “But I think there will be a couple more contenders, at last, for the top spot in the Premier League so it should be an exciting season.”
