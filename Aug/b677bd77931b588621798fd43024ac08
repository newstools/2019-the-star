Mr Seed has asked his fans not to judge him by his fashion and hairstyles. When he started doing music, Seed had dreadlocks, and now he has short-dyed hair. He shocked his fans when he decided to chop them off. He said his decision to cut the locks was because of an anticipated visit to his gorgeous fiancée Nimo Gachuiri's parents home. He wanted to look presentable and at the same time keep it real, as he casually dressed for the occasion. "People judge gospel artistes with our outside appearance, but God concentrates on the heart and your deeds," he told Word Is on Wednesday. He went on to say even if he dresses in suits and looks good from the outside, if his heart is not pure, he will not please God. "I would request my fans not to judge me by the ways I look. If my style does not make you happy, at least like my music and what I post because it could be of importance," he said. Despite maintaining his hair dye, Seed seems to like his tattoos, which are on his left hand. "One of my tattoos has my late dad's name and another one is for my son's name. I had an idea of naming my son Gold even before I got him and so I tattooed his name on my hand," he said. Mr Seed, who was previously signed under EMB records, is making Boss moves after launching his studios, an operation that has been on course for roughly five months now. It's a project he believes will be able ‘to help artistes reach their musical dreams at affordable rates’. Through an Insta video, Seed said, "God amekuwa faithful sana, ju right now I want to take this chance to welcome every artiste kwenye Starborn Empire Studio. We are now open, come work with the best." Speaking about working with Mr Seed, Damorn said Seed has been supportive even in his previous songs. Damorn has released a new song titled 'Dekadeka', which he says was inspired by his real-life experience. "The video is all from my wedding," he said.
