Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has reportedly been instructed by the club’s owners to prioritise winning the Premier League and the Champions League this season. The Reds haven’t won the title since 1989, but missed out by just one point to Manchester City last season. They were crowned European champions in June as they overcame Tottenham. As reported by The Mirror, Liverpool’s owners, Fenway Sports Group, want Klopp to focus on winning the league and the Champions League rather than the FA Cup and the League Cup. Liverpool have a rich history in the domestic cup competitions - they have won the League Cup a record eight times and the FA Cup seven times. However, they are facing a hectic schedule this campaign as they also have to participate in the Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup.= The report indicates that Klopp may well field a weakened team in cup games this season, as he did against Wolves in the FA Cup last season when Liverpool were knocked out in the third round. Liverpool, who were beaten by City in the Community Shield last weekend, commenced their Premier League campaign with a 4-1 victory against Norwich at Anfield on Friday night.
