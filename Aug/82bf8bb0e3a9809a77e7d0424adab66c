construction of a Sh 500 million mothers and baby facility has started at Kapsabet County Referral Hospital. The 350-bed capacity will provide convenient and quality healthcare. Sometimes patients have been sharing beds due to shortage of space. Governor Stephen Sang told reporters on Monday he project will help realise the government's agenda of universal affordable healthcare. "Construction of such facility is a great milestone," Sang said. He praised the national government for ensuring that the hospital is provided with vital equipment. The county has a renal unit, two theatres (one in Kapsabet and another in Nandi Hills), CT scan diagnostic equipment, MRI and an oxygen plant. Sang urged residents to make use of the Kapsabet hospital, minimising visits to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. The DP was expected on Tuesday to lay the foundation stone at Kobujoy health Centre for construction of a new outpatient unit, the mother and child facility. He will commission the renal unit, CT scan and oxygen plant. He will also tour Nandi Hills hospital to commission the radiology unit, power upgrade, standby 385KvH generator, open a new theatre and check the progress of the Nandi Hills outpatient unit under construction.
