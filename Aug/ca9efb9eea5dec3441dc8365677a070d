Alexis Sanchez’s loan move from Manchester United to Inter Milan is edging closer, according to reports in Italy. The 30-year-old, who has struggled for form at United, is in negotiations with the Serie A side over a season-long loan deal from Old Trafford. And now the transfer is near with clubs likely to finalise the terms of the deal on Monday, according to several Italian outlets including La Gazzetta dello Sport and Tuttosport, as reported by Football Italia. They report that both clubs are hopeful of agreeing the move after increasing the salary figure to £4.2million. Inter Milan welcome Lecce in their opening Serie A match on Monday night and Sanchez could reportedly be in attendance before undergoing a medical the next day. United are facing a staggering £36million bill if Sanchez’s protracted loan move to Inter is made permanent. The deal is expected to include an option for Inter to make the deal permanent next summer. The choice to sign Sanchez on a permanent deal next summer is believed to be set at a fixed price of just under £15m.
