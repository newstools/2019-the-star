Defence PS Major General (Rtd) Gordon Kihalangwa has said measures are in place to ensure the census is peaceful along disputed boundaries. Speaking in Isiolo town during an inspection, Kihalangwa said the government has deployed enough security personnel and urged wananchi to go on with enumeration. He said they would be counted in their preferred areas. More security officers are deployed to trading centres along the Kenya-Ethiopia border and nothing would stop the count, Kihalangwa said. The PS, who is in charge of the Upper Eastern region, said the census has nothing to do with 2022 General Election but will help government plan and decide how to allocate resources fairly. He said the government plans after every census and considers population, geographical size, poverty index and marginalised areas. After the census, the government will be able to allocate funds for people living with disabilities. During the previous census, many people were deprived of benefits because they were hidden by superstitious parents who considered them a bad omen. On the Meru-Isiolo border, the PS said the dispute is a long-standing and would only be solved by residents. He said the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has nothing to do with the census. The PS warned that any census malpractices would be punished. (Edited by V. Graham)
