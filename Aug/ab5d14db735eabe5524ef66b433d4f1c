Hockey Premier League side Wazalendo has been dealt a disappointing blow with striker Mathew Mutiso ruled out for the rest of the season with a muscle injury.  Mutiso who was the hero as his 58th minute goal inflicted Police with their second loss of the season, a result that brought the team level on points with the law enforcers albeit on an inferior goal difference will miss Sunday's clash against Sikh Union. A rock in Fidelis Kimanzi's attack, he is undoubtedly a big player in the dressing room and on the pitch as well as having scored five of Wazalendo's 13 goals this season. His agility, creativity and explosivity will be missed. The vice-captain joins the treatment table alongside captain Kennedy Munialo who is nursing broken right thumb thus missed the  National team Olympic qualification duties in South Africa. A four-month recovery period has been placed on Mutiso's injury. Kimanzi is unmoved by the damage and feels he has sufficient cover in attack to counter the congested second leg fixture. In  Mutiso's absence, Kimanzi will rely on Danstone Baraza to lead the attack "We have three games in seven days and requires players to be fit. Munialo has been out and its unfortunate Mutiso joins him. Against Police, he played for five minutes and made a difference but our worst fears have been confirmed. Surgery is required later this week as advised by the doctor and will be out for four months, technically his season is over." noted Kimanzi He added: "We don't heavily rely on one player because we have a pool of other good ones. This is the chance for them to showcase their skills. Yeah, we need them but we have  quality players to fill their boots." Sunday's showdown could prove critical for both clubs, with Wazalendo looking to challenge Butali and Police for the title as Sikh Union fights to avoid relegation.
