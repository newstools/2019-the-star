An oil tanker ploughed through a house and overturned in Makindu on the Nairobi-Mombasa highway spilling its contents at dawn on Thursday. Five people, among them the driver, narrowly escaped unhurt. The tanker was headed to Nairobi when the incident occurred around 4am. "The steering wheel failed and lockedÂ  as I was overtaking another vehicle and the tanker hit the house before it overturned," said the driver who identified himself only as Lawrence. Police officers were called to secure the scene immediately after the accident. A fire engine, brigade staff from Makueni county and other officials protected the scene. Makueni county police commander Joseph Napeiyan said there was no major scare as police had secured the incident's site in time. "We acted swiftly and secured the incident's site before people could go there. Police officers where alert and ensured nobody went close until the tanker was removed from the scene," he told the Star. The owners of the flattened house said they lost property of unknown value as the tanker completely destroyed the sitting room.
