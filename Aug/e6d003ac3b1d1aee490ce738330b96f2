Romelu Lukaku was ‘bored’ at Manchester United and needed to leave for his own happiness, according to his international boss Roberto Martinez. The Belgium striker has since switched Old Trafford for Inter Milan, and he scored on his competitive debut against Lecce on Monday night. Lukaku will be hoping to reignite his career following the £73million move, and Martinez admits he needed to move on from England. “Romelu needed a new challenge. Sometimes you get bored of a club,” he said. “Working with Conte will please him and the project of Inter, who will chase the title, is interesting. I saw Lukaku laugh again and it made me happy.” Lukaku’s career had turned slightly stale at United, and he heads to Serie A with the bit between his teeth, ready to prove plenty of doubters wrong. After arriving in Italy though, Corriere dello Sport claimed he was overweight and out of shape due to missing most of United’s pre-season preparations. The Italian news outlet claimed that the Belgium international was 104kg while Inter wanted him to be below 100kg. The 26-year-old trained on his days off to shed the extra weight, and was fit enough to play for his new side in their season opener this week. They thrashed Lecce 4-0 and Lukaku was on the scoresheet, leading to his manager noting that ‘tonight showed why we tried so hard’ to sign him.
