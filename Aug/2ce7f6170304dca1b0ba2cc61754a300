Josiah Nyamboga Onyoni is accused of obtaining Sh 1,066,000 from Justice Njiri Nyagah in Westlands on diverse dates between July 19 and September 10 last year. The accused claimed he was in a position to run a maize buying and selling business to fund Nyagahâ€™s wedding. In a second count, Onyoni is charged with cheating.
