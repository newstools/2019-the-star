Women in West Pokot county have been asked to embrace exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months to enable their babies develop immunity against diseases. County executive for health Geoffrey Lipale urged men to support their lactating wives by exempting them from moving with livestock over long distances in search of pasture and water. Speaking on Monday in Kapenguria, Lipale said exclusive breastfeeding reduces child mortality. “Lactating mothers should be given special consideration to ensure that they exclusively breastfed their children to help prevent diseases,” he said. He said numbers of mothers in the county who breastfeed exclusively are very low. His ministry is committed to sensitizing women to ensure the numbers increase. The executive said migration of residents during dry seasons in search of pasture and water affects exclusive breastfeeding. He appealed to the community to allow lactating mothers to stay at home and give full attention to their babies. Lipale also said lack of enough food affects breastfeeding. “This county is hit by drought yearly and this has hindered many mothers from breastfeeding their children for six months. We need irrigation schemes to enable our mothers to have enough food throughout the year,” he said. He said  malnutrition is high in the county due to lack of enough food and urged stakeholders to join efforts and help in ending hunger.
