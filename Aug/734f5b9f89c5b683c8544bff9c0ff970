A nominated MCA in Kiambu has urged women members of Akorino churches to form groups so that they can improve their lives. MCA Sarah Kimunyi said most churches have women's groups, but Akorino women do not have one. She said they miss out on a lot of opportunities, such as training and funds which are given to groups. "Akorino women should rise up. We have witnessed churches that have very strong women groups such as CWA of Catholic, Woman's Guild of PCEA, Women Council of the AIPCA and others," Kimunyi said. "I'm also urging our pastors to allow our women to form such groups so that they can be empowered and grow. We need to grow, learn, educate our children and do business." Kimunyi spoke during the launch of Lari Akorino Federation Assembly community groups, which brought together all Akorinos in Lari constituency. MP Jonah Mburu was the chief guest during the meeting at Kimende Primary School. Kijabe MCA Nyutu Wamwere was present. Mburu said,Â "The Akorino members of today are clever. We need to support them to develop and realise their dreams and visions." Lafaka chairman Harun Muturi said their forefathers focused on cleansing themselves in readiness to go to Heaven. He said even if that is still their main focus, they have realised that without financial empowerment, they might live a poor life. "That is why we decided to form the CBO. We aim to build modern churches, build flats, develop each other economically where individuals can borrow money and much more. After 10 years, we shall have something to show," he said.
