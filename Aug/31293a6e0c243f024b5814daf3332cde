 Residents of Lamu East subcounty have reason to celebrate after they were connected to the national power grid for the first time since independence 56 years ago. The more than half a century of darkness will be a thing of the past as 4,000 street lights are installed in Mtangawanda, Siyu, Kizingitini, Faza, Mbwajumwali, Pate and neighbouring areas. The subcounty has a population of 15,000. Only a few well-to-do individuals have been enjoying power from costly solar panels and generators. The main towns, villages and roads will benefit in Phase One of the project which has cost Sh54 million. The electrification is a collaboration of the county government and the Kenya Power Company. The project started in December 2018 following the signing of a memorandum of understanding between Governor Fahim Twaha and Kenya Power. Lamu elder Khaldun Vae said there is a new dawn in the region which has for decades been marginalised by successive regimes. “This is very important in our lives. We have lived in darkness for so long. We have suffered marginalisation and there was nothing we could do. Today we are glad,”  Vae said. Residents say the street lights will help in the reduction of crime and insecurity. “Our trade and businesses will grow. This place will experience peace and tranquillity,” Mohamed Loo said. The electrification project was officially launched by Lamu East MP Athman Shariff and other county leaders on Thursday.
