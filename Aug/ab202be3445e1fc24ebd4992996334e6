Some of Europe’s biggest clubs have discussed proposals for a revamped Champions League that would include 96 teams. Under the proposals, six English teams would be included in Europe’s elite club competition, two more than is currently the case. As reported by The Sun, the tournament would involve 16 groups, each of which would have six clubs. The report indicates that the reform would be discussed at a meeting in Geneva next month. The major English clubs are against the proposal as it would mean they would not enter the League Cup. A host of ideas are being discussed as part of plans to change the Champions League from 2024. The top two teams in each group would go through to the Champions League knockout stages as usual. The third and fourth placed teams would go into the Europa League, with the fifth and sixth placed sides going into the new third European competition. In addition, there wouldn’t be any qualifying rounds, with those teams being placed into the main draw.
