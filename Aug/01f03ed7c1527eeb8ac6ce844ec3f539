A depleted former Kenya Hockey Union men's Premier League champions Police will look to bounce back to winning ways when they face Sailors at City Park Stadium today. The law enforcers fell 2-1 to Wazalendo on Sunday where they were badly exposed at the back but there was enough on show to suggest Police are still title contenders. Defenders Samwel Oungo and Victor Wekesa will have to be on top of their game to silence Sailors' high-flying Douglas Nyerere. Police will need to get strikers Govan Mbeki and Titus Kimutai firing if they are to bridge the four-point gap between them and defending champions Butali. The law enforcers will miss utility defender Robert Masibo, Samson Kibirir and Kennedy Kibweche due to injuries. Seasoned midfielder Willis Okeyo faces a late fitness test. With a depleted squad, Mugambi is banking on experience and remains optimistic of extending their unbeaten run against the Sailors, which dates back to March 2017. He said: "After losing, I expect an immediate response from my players. Injuries played a part in the defeat but we have moved on. Defensive adjustments are necessary now that we have a lot of injuries and that's why you saw Masibo playing on the left as opposed to his preferred central position." "Attacking-wise, Mbeki and Titus need to rediscover their form. We have seen flashes of their best and we trust them to do their part. We will use our experience and tactics to win the match." On his part, Sailors' coach Timothy Kamar wants his troops to approach the game cautiously. "We will tackle the game judiciously against a top side with good, quality and dangerous players. We have trained well and thus ready for the encounter," said Kamar. A sixth win of the season for Police will see them trail the leaders by just a point ahead of what could be a title decider on September 8. Sailors, who are seventh with 10 points are chasing their fourth win of the season.
