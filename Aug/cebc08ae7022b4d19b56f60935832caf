Kenya’s Hassan Shaffi Bakari settled for silver after suffering a humiliating defeat against Botswana’s Mohamed Rajab in the 52kg flyweight at the Salle Al Amal Arena in Rabat. Rajab outscored the Kenyan as he recorded 5-0. Round One clearly belonged to the Botswana boxer as he enjoyed both height and body advantage. Shaffi could hardly get his targets as the opponent engaged him a close contest. This saw the winner floor Shaffi barely two minutes into the round. The South African came in the second round with the aim of flooring Shafi and took the fight to him from the bell. In fact, Shaffi suffered more in the second round as the rival subjected him to body blows amid little countering from the Kenyan.It was a miracle that Shaffi survived the round as the Botswana boxer intensified his search for a knockout. Things got worse in round 3 as Shaffi was left high and drank, occasionally being saved by the ropes amid heavy blows on his head. Shaffi kissed the canvas again in Round 3 to signal that it was all over and indeed at this point he had little to offer. In fact it was a miracle how he survived the whole fight. In an interview, however, he said incurred an injury on his hand and could not operate a usual. Apart from Shaffi’s bronze, four other boxers settled fo4 bronze medals. They included Fredrick Ramogi (super heavy +91), Boniface Mugude (welter 69kg), George Ouma Cosby (middle 75kg) and Elly Ajowi ( heavyweight 91kg).
