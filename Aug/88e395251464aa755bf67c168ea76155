The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has confirmed that it received names of aspirants from Jubilee Party for Kibra by elections. IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati on Tuesday said the list was forwarded to the commission on Monday evening. "It has come to the attention of the commission that Jubilee Party has denied authoring the said letter and termed it as fake," the commission said on its Twitter handle. The commission has written to the party seeking clarification about the list. IEBC had communicated earlier through a Gazette notice that parties interested in fielding candidates should submit their names on or before August 26. Jubilee Party had said on Monday that it had decided to field candidates for the Kibra seat. Secretary General Rafael Tuju confirmed that the party will be in the race scheduled for November 7. He said the party's analysis confirmed the party is competitive enough to fieild a candidate. ODM party unveiled aspirants to the public on Sunday as they seek to replace the late area MP Ken Okoth who died after a battle with cancer.
