Frank Lampard has ordered his players to toughen up as his Chelsea return continued to stutter on Sunday. The Blues manager’s homecoming was ruined by Wilfried Ndidi, whose second half header cancelled out Mason Mount’s early opener to leave Lampard winless following the club’s opening three games. Lampard said: “It’s a results business, clearly. We have performances in us, we have shown that already. But there are moments - personal moments in the game ­— where we have to be tougher.” “We have to have game management. If the game turns slightly, we are good enough to wrestle that back and move the ball better. That’s something we can work on. Those moments when we were great, it was great to see every player in the team doing their bit. The next stage is when it turns against us, and it will do because this is the Premier League, we have other ways.” “I don’t want us to be seen as an attacking team that flies out of the blocks - but then you can give us a little sucker punch. That can’t be the way. So that’s why there’s some strong lessons from today.” On his heroes reception as he took charge of his first home match since returning to Stamford Bridge in the summer, Lampard added: ‘It was obviously a big, special moment for me to come back to the club and to manage them, to manage them at Stamford Bridge. I’d say the stuff of dreams, for me it is a huge thing. “But my focus today was on the game, trying to win the match, I appreciate the fans and thanks for that but I’m here to do a job. Here to try and win for this club and we can do better than we did today.” Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers added: “I feel as though we should have won it. I thought a point was the least we deserved.”
