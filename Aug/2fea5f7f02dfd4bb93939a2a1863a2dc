Olympic Games silver medallist Julius Yego is looking beyond the All Africa Games here in Morocco and he has set himself a target of over 90m come the World Championships next month in Doha, Qatar. He, however, cautioned that javelin is very unpredictable nowadays and it has nothing to do with an individual’s current form or shape. He said javelin is driven by so many issues and the weather plays a major role. “One has to prepare and also psyche himself to be at his/her best, “ he added. He said having big throws before the world events or major games counts for nothing, sometimes. He said before Beijing in 2015, the best he had done was 82m and he ended up winning the title with a throw of 92m. At the moment, he revealed that nine people had better throws than him. “It’s all about mental strength and that is why I have set my target this year,” he noted. He said javelin is very unpredictable and anyone who qualifies for the final can win. “We have people who have had big throws in Diamond League only to end up miserably. It is dangerous when complacency sets in because this event depends on how you wake up on the day,” he noted. He added that he will give the African Games his best shot and see how it pans out, adding that the Rabat event will serve as his build-up ahead of Doha next month.
