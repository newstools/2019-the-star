Titus Ekiru defied the hot weather conditions to hand Kenya their fifth gold medal in the 21km Half Marathon at the ongoing All Africa Games at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, Morocco. Ekiru clocked 1:01:42 to take gold as Moroccan duo of Reda Elaaraby (1:02:44) and Hamza Sahli (1:02:45) ensured silver and bronze remained at home. Kenya’s Morris Munene took fourth place in 1:02:51 with Panuel Mkungo placing fifth in 1:03:10. In an interview, Ekiru said he had little difficulty in the race as the course was compatible with his training at Kaptagat. “I train in same conditions back home so I guess it was easy,” he noted. He said he tested the field at 5km and there was no response hence he knew all was well. When he reached 10km, he did it again and this time there was no looking back. “In training, I am used to pacing myself so at this point, it was very easy and I decided to go it alone,” said Ekiru, who won the Milan Half Marathon in April. He was non-committal on his next assignment, saying he is waiting for instructions from his manager, Federico Rosa. The women’s race saw Kenya’s Hellen Chepkurgat and Grace Kimanzi fall off the medal bracket with Ethiopians sweeping the board. Jepkurgat placed fourth in 1:12:29 while Kimanzi closed the top five places in 1:13:16. Yalemzerf Densa led an Ethiopian sweep in 1:10:26 with compatriots Degitu Asires (1:10:31) and Meseret Tola ( 1:12:08) taking silver and bronze. Another Kenyan, Caroline Korir, did not finish. In an interview, Jepkurgut blamed the hard course and the weather for sliding off the medal bracket. “When we started off the race, the weather was okay but things changed all of a sudden and I couldn’t cope. I even led for a while but when the conditions changed. They took a toll on me forcing me to slow down," said Chepkurgat. Kimanzi on her part said besides the harsh weather conditions, she got an ankle injury at the beginning of the race.
