The Interior Ministry has said it plans to carry out a mop-up exercise for unregistered persons for Huduma Number. The Director of National Registration Reuben Kimotho on Wednesday through a statement said it plans to carry out a Rapid Result Initiative-RRI program for 30 days to mop up all the unregistered persons ahead of the next phase of Huduma Namba exercise. Kimotho said the exercise is set to start fromÂ  September 2, 2019, to October 4, 2019. He further directed that all county deputy registration officers in consultation with their respective deputy county commissioners to come up with programs covering all locations, schools and market places during the period of the RRI. He directed that the program should be copied to himself for ease of monitoring. "In addition to this you are required to ensure that all registration stations have enough registration materials covering the entire period to avoid unnecessary disruptions of the exercise," Kimotho said. He further added that it is important to note that adequate publicity should be done by both the deputy county commissioners and the deputy county registrars through public barazas, schools, religious places, locals FM radio stations and market places. While speaking to the Star on phone, Government Spokesman Cyrus Oguna said the RRI will also target those who did not register for the Huduma Namba for lack of identification documents.
