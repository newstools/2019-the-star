A model who has featured on the covers of Vogue Australia and British Vogue says she feels "very disrespected" after a magazine that interviewed her printed the wrong photo next to it, misidentifying her as another black model. Adut Akech, 19, says she received an apology from Australia's Who magazine for the blunder but remains "deeply affected". She points out the irony of the error given the topics covered: "In the interview, I spoke about how people view refugees and people's attitude to color in general. With the article, they published a large photo saying it was me. But it was of another black girl." "Not only do I personally feel insulted and disrespected, but I feel like my entire race has been disrespected too - and it is why I feel it is important that I address this issue." "Whoever did this clearly thought that was me in that picture and that’s not okay." Whoever did this clearly thought that was me in that picture and that’s not okay." She also mentions past incidents where she has been "called by the name of other models who happen to be of the same ethnicity... we know that this doesn't happen with white models". Who magazine says the error happened because they had been sent the wrong photo by a PR agency working for Melbourne Fashion Week. The model was born in South Sudan and raised in Australia, and says the incident shows the country has "got to do better" in its treatment of others like her.
