Failure to provide efficient services by water companies across the country has been blamed on political interference by leaders of county governments. County governments do not have the autonomy to professionally do their job due to the meddling by politicians, Kenya County Government Workers Union deputy secretary-general Matilda Kibet and Embu Water and Sanitation chairman Joel Ngatiari said at the weekend. Kibet and Ngatiari spoke during the closing of Water Companies (Wasco) Games in Embu on Saturday. “We have many challenges that we as water companies face. We would like you (Embu Governor Martin Wambora) to take to the Council of Governors for deliberation so that they can be solved. One of them is political interference,” Kibet said. Another of the issues is respect for water laws so that water companies can do their work optimally. Kibet said water reforms were deliberately enacted to enable water companies to render services independently. She said that while water companies were not perfect, they were ahead of other departments in performance. Ngatiari echoed her sentiments. “Mine is to request our Governor, Martin Wambora, to speak to the other governors and tell them to support water companies with minimal political interference.” Kibet decried the mistreatment of water companies’ administrations by officers fail. She said it was unfortunate that some water companies' managing directors are now hiding after arrest warrants were issued against them. She was referring to Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company's acting managing director Nahashon Muguna, who last week went into hiding after National Environment Management Authority officials went to arrest him over a sewer problem. More than 50 teams took part in the games which were closed by Wambora. Nairobi was the overall winners followed by Nakuru.
