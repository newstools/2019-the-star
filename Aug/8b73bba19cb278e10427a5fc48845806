Renowned female boxing coach Anjere ‘Priest’ Analo reckons that boxer Christine Ongare’s loss in the quarter-final stage at the All African Games in Morocco was due to her last-minute change in her training regime. Analo who mentored Ongare  for years at the Kariobangi Social Hall boxing facility said Ongare was  a huge medal prospect fro Kenya but her decision to alter her boxing tactics and stance cost her in the very first bout she featured in after getting byes in previous rounds in Rabat. Ongare was beaten  by a unanimous decision  against Nigerian Oriyomi Ayisat Morenikeji “Mammy(Ongare) changed what had been working for her down the years when she decided to join the Police training camp. I think it altered the way she approached her bouts. Normally she is a boxer very good at winning points but since she moved to police she has become a fighter something that is against her natural instincts” explained Analo. Ongare a Flyweight commonwealth bronze medal winner at the Gold Coast Games in Australia last year’s loss in Morocco means that yet again  Kenya women pugilists will return with no medal. This follows the exit of Simbi Lorna,Light welterweight Everlyn Akinyi  who was beaten by Hlimi Kholoud of Tunisia and Elizabeth Andiego who lost out to Nigerian  Adejumola Esther  in the middleweight category.
