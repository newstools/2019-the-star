National Environment Management Authority has closed Sameer Agriculture and Livestock Limited for discharging untreated wastewater straight to the public sewerage. The company is a milk processing plant, which produces Daima Milk and other dairy products. Officials from Nema raided the facility which is located in Industrial Area in Nairobi on Tuesday to access its operations. "We have to close down this facility because they are discharging untreated wastewater bypassing the treatment plant," Ag. Director General Mamo B.MamoÂ said. The company's Managing Director managed to escape before Nema officials arrived at the scene. The company's Cooperation Manager was arrested for discharging untreated effluent into the Nairobi Sewer that results in the pollution of Nairobi River. Addressing the media after the closure, Mamo said the exercise will continue, putting on notice companies that are discharging untreated waste. "We want to put all those facilities polluting our rivers on notice that Nema is not going to stand and wait for you to pollute our rivers. We will continue with this exercise and ensure that our rivers are clean," he added. Nema said the company failed to follow the Water Regulation Act of 2013 by discharging the waste directly to the river. The closure comes after Nema director general issued orders to close down Kamongo recycling factory until they comply with its orders.
