Barcelona outcast Philippe Coutinho is reportedly set to turn down a loan switch to Tottenham, according to reports. The Brazilian has been offered to several Premier League sides by the Spanish giants, with Mauricio Pochettino believed to have been interested in securing the season-long loan before the transfer window slams shut today. Coutinho had become embroiled in a top-flight transfer tussle, as the league’s elite clubs attempt to finalise their dealings ahead of the new season. Barcelona had been willing to allow Coutinho to leave this summer after the Brazilian fell out of favour at the Spanish champions, with any funds generated from the transfer planned for an attempt to secure Neymar’s return. Coutinho was understood to have been keen on a return to England, triggering Spurs to assess their options ahead of Christian Eriksen’s potential switch to Manchester United. However, it emerged that Eriksen’s negotiations with the Old Trafford side had ended on Tuesday morning. Previous reports stated the star’s reluctance to leave the club on loan, amid concerns over his long-term future. Arsenal and Manchester United had also been touted as possible destinations for the playmaker, although neither currently appear interested in a deal with priorities remaining elsewhere. Coutinho had struggled to endear himself to the Barcelona faithful following his £145million move to the Nou Camp and will be allowed to leave if a suitable party can be found.
