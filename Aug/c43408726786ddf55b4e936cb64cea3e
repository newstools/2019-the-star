Residents of Lamu have been without water over Sh3.6 million unpaid electricity bill. KPLC business manager Bernard Kataka confirmed that they had disconnected supply over accumulated arrears yet to be paid by Lamu Water and Sewerage Company Limited The acute water shortage started on Thursday last week after KPLC cut off the power supply at Lamu’s main pumping station over huge debt. At least 5,000 water meters serving more than 30,000 people in Lamu have been switched off. Hotels and businesses have been the worst-hit as customers avoid them due to the lack of water. The situation has equally affected operations at Manda airport. Homeowners are buying water from vendors. Residents complained it is unfair for them to suffer without water despite having paid all dues to the water company. “My hotel has been without water for almost two weeks. Tourists come here but once they discover there is no water, they check out. This is bad for business,” hotelier Ali Abubakar said. Residents in the Lamu Old Town, Shella, Manda, Kashmir, Bombay, India and Wiyoni are using untreated water from open wells. Residents have threatened to hold mass demonstrations over the situation this week to push for a resolution.
