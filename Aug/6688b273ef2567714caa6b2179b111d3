Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren reportedly believes his time in England is coming to an end amid links with a move to Serie A side Roma. Corriere dello Sport have reported that Lovren ‘considers his English cycle closed’ and ‘would be willing to lower his salary’ to seal a move to Italy. The Italian publication adds that Lovren may even talk with Liverpool to reduce their demands to help him secure an exit. The 30-year-old has fallen down the pecking order at Anfield and wasn’t even on the bench for Friday’s Premier League opener against Norwich. Joel Matip kept him out the side on Liverpool’s run to Champions League glory last season and Joe Gomez started alongside Virgil van Dijk in Friday’s 4-1 victory over the Premier League new boys. The Croatia international has been plying his trade in the Premier League since 2013, when Southampton signed him from Lyon. So impressive was his first season on the south coast that Liverpool, then managed by Brendan Rodgers, swooped to sign him in a £20m transfer. Lovren has made 170 appearances for Liverpool since arriving in 2014, scoring seven goals. It remains to be seen, however, if Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp would be prepared to navigate the season with three out-and-out centre-backs. Fabinho deputised there last season, while Liverpool signed highly-rated 17-year-old Sepp van den Berg from Ajax in the summer.
