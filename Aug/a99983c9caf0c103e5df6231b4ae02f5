The Kenya U15 National team who came out top of Group A at the ongoing CECAFA U15 Championships in Eritrea has been pitted against Rwanda in the first semifinal set to be played tomorrow, at the Asmara Stadium starting 2 pm EAT. The FKF Center of Excellence side who are yet to taste defeat registered convincing wins over Somalia (3-1), Sudan (4-0) and hosts Eritrea (2-1), the victories coupled with a 1-1 draw against Burundi in Group matches played between August 16, and August 22, in Asmara. Those results have marked them as favourites to be crowned champions in the inaugural regional youth tournament. The second semifinal will see Uganda take on Burundi at 4.30 pm at the same venue. The final has been scheduled for Friday, in Asmara. Meanwhile, Harambee Starlets opponents Malawi have called up China-based striker Tabitha Chawinga and her Sweden-based younger sister Temwa Chawinga for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games qualifying match in Blantyre tomorrow. Tabitha, the 2018 and 2019 CAF Women’s Footballer of the Year nominee, and her sister Temwa, missed Malawi’s participation at Southern Africa football competition Cosafa Championship due to club commitments. Now, Malawi coach Abel Mkandawire has recalled the duo ahead of the second-round qualifiers. Tabitha is on the books of Chinese side Jiangsu Suning whilst Temwa plies her trade in Sweden for Kvaransverdens IK. Malawi is smarting from the group stage exit at the Cosafa Championship which took place in Port Elizabeth, South Africa where they beat Madagascar 2-0, Comoros Islands 13-0 and lost 3-1 to the hosts. At the first round of the continental journey to Tokoyo, Malawi beat Mozambique 11-1 and 3-0 over two legs with Temwa and Tabitha.
