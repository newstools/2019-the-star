Dutch winger Arjen Robben has refused to rule out a return to football despite retiring from the game just last month. The 35-year-old, who recently announced he would be bringing his 19-year career to a close, has revealed he might consider making a comeback if he can maintain his fitness levels away from the sport. Robben won major trophies in four different countries and fears he may ‘miss the whole thing too much’ over the coming months. When asked about a potential return, Robben told NPO Radio: “I always say: never say never. Maybe in one or two months I’ll have a strange feeling that I miss the whole thing too much and will decide I have to go back.” “But of course it doesn’t get any easier the longer you’re retired. I do not rate the chances (of returning) very highly.” The wideman won the Premier League title twice in his first two seasons at Chelsea and went on to score the winning goal for Bayern Munich in the 2013 Champions League final, but his final years in the game were tainted by injury. On his retirement, Robben added: “It’s without a doubt the hardest decision I’ve ever made in my career. At the moment I am fit and healthy and as a fan of many other sports, I want to keep it that way for the future. So I will definitely stop, but it is good that way.” “It is, without doubt, the most difficult decision I have had to make in my career. A decision in which heart and mind collided. The love for the game gives you the conviction that you can still handle the whole world, as opposed to the reality that not everything works the way you want and you are no longer the 16-year-old boy who had no idea what an injury meant.”
