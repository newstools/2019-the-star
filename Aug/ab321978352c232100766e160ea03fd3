Lamu leaders have joined residents in terror-prone areas to call for extension of the census to enable everyone to be counted. The leaders also want the exercise extended in all other areas in Lamu which are faced by infrastructural challenges like the far-flung islands in Lamu East subcounty. The Population and Housing Census commenced on the night of August 24 and is expected to end on August 31. Speaking in Lamu town on Tuesday, Lamu deputy governor Abdulhakim Aboud and Lamu East MP Athman Shariff expressed concern that some areas might not be accessed in time for the census before the deadline. Basuba ward in Lamu East has been listed as the most terror-prone area due to its closeness to the Somalia border and the ease with which Al Shabaab militants have previously been able to cross and conduct attacks. It’s made of five villages (Basuba, Milimani, Mangai, Mararani and Kiangwe) all within Boni forest where a multi-agency security operation called Linda Boni is underway. Residents in some of the villages have reported the slow pace of the census,  expressing their fears that the entire are might not be covered. “I have spoken with enumerators covering these areas and they have admitted that the progress is really slow due to insecurity. Not just in terror-prone areas but all over Lamu. Some areas are sparsely populated and need more time to cover,” Aboud said. The DG said he had already initiated talks that might see the exercise extended in Lamu. Lamu East MP Athman Shariff said insecurity in some parts of the county shouldn’t be used as a scapegoat to deny residents their right to be counted. The MP said the government has a duty to ensure every single Kenyan, no matter their location, takes part in the census.
