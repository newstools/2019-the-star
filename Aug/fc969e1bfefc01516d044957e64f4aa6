Auditors have been urged to embrace professional ethics and play a proactive role to ensure public resources are properly utilised. Institute of Internal Auditors Kenya chairperson Victoria Angwenyi asked internal auditors to appraise themselves with relevant laws on financial management. Speaking at a forum bringing together over 2,800 internal auditors, Angwenyi underscored the need for the profession to assert itself as a key player and a catalyst of national development. “Internal auditors should be proactive rather than reactive and should adhere to their professional calling of being the assurance givers that public resources are being utilised prudently and for the intended purpose,” Angwenyi said. She lauded the role auditors play in detecting fraud, saying they have helped avert loss of public funds. She said through special audits the government has been able to establish areas of financial leakage and develop appropriate interventions. The forum was also attended by Institute of Internal Auditors-Global president Richard Chambers who said the international body will continue to offer capacity building to members. The award-winning author stressed the need for auditors to stick to the International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF), which outlines standards of professional internal audit. The Institute of Internal Auditors-Global headquartered in the USA is engaged in capacity and development training of internal auditors. IIA Kenya chapter was formed in 2002 and has grown over the years to a current membership of over 2800 members in the public and private sectors.
