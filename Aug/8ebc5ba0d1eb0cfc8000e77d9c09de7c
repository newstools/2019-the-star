Emmanuel Adebayor isnâ€™t ready to call time on his nomadic football career just yet after signing a one-year deal with Turkish minnows Kayserispor. The Togo striker was a free agent having left Istanbul Basaksehir earlier this summer after three years. The 35-year-old has now made the move to Kayserispor, who finished 10th in the Turkish Super Lig last season. It will be the ninth different club of a career that has taken Adebayor through France, England and Spain. He first moved to the Premier League in 2006 with Arsenal before a controversial move to Manchester City in 2009. He enjoyed loan spells at Real Madrid and Tottenham before making his move to White Hart Lane permanent in 2012. He made 12 appearances for Crystal Palace in 2016 but scored only once.
