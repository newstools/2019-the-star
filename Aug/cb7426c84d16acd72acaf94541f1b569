Gaspo team are keen to return to the top of the league standings and claim the Football Kenya Federation women’s Premier League title altogether as the league hits the homestretch. Gaspo, who were promoted to the top tier this season, are placed third on the table standings with 54 points from 20 matches behind joint leaders, champions Vihiga and Trans Nzoia Falcons, who have 55 points from the same number of games each. Gaspo coach Isaac Maluki said they are keen to bag the title on their first attempt. “The race for the title is still wide open but we are determined to be the team that takes it home,” observed Maluki. Maluki, at the same time, believes national team Harambee Starlets' players,   Corazon Aquino and Wincate Kaari's availability will be crucial having bagged a wealth of experience and exposure with the national side. Aquino and Kaari are in the Starlets team that host Malawi at the Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos in an Africa 2020 Olympic Games qualifier second leg match tomorrow. “Definitely, the two have the experience and exposure we need and we hope their availability will boost our morale ahead of our remaining matches," noted the tactician. Maluki also revealed he will give more game time to new signings Nainangwe Mwaipopo from Simba FC and free agent Madeline Otieno.
