The Jubilee Party will field a candidate in the upcoming Kibra by-election, the party's secretary general Raphael Tuju has confirmed. Through a statement on Monday Tuju said the party, having consulted within the party leadership with respect to Kibra constituency have decided to feature a candidate. "We would like to tell party members that Jubilee party will be fielding a candidate in the forthcoming Kibra Constituency by-election on November 7, 2019," Tuju said. Tuju said that their analysis and consultations confirm that Jubilee Party is competitive enough in the forthcoming political contest. "It is noteworthy that the neighbouring Lang'ata constituency was won by a Jubilee candidate contrary to conventional political analysis. "We are therefore giving notice to our members who are interested in contesting the seat on a Jubilee party ticket to forward their applications to NationalÂ  elections board." Tuju says the condition and timeliness will be in accordance with dictates of the party NEB. Since last year's March handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga, the two biggest parties have respected each other and not fielded candidates against each other in the by-elections of Wajir West, Embakasi South and Ugenya.
