Nearly a quarter of the 1.1 million people in Kitui are facing starvation unless they get food aid, the county drought management authority office has said. National Drought Management Authority Kitui coordinator Francis Koma on Friday said more than 220,000 people are in dire need of assistance. "I would like to stress that the rate at which people are drifting to crisis and emergency is very high,” he told the Star on the phone. Koma fears that by next month, the number of food-insecure residents of Kitui would hit the 300,000 mark. He said the people are not only facing food insecurity, but water scarcity is also a major problem. The most affected areas are Mwingi North, Mwingi Central, Kitui East, Kitui South, and Kitui rural subcounty. Koma said except for Kitui rural, the situation in the other four areas was exacerbated by the herders from Garissa and Tana River counties who have invaded the area. He said that the prevailing the dire food insecurity and water shortage problem in Kitui was caused by failed rains in the past three seasons. Koma said that pasture and water for livestock are fast diminishing. He said the department had sent out an appeal for support from all stakeholders to salvage the situation and prevent it from getting worse. Koma said that already Tanathi Water Board has started water tinkering in water-scarce areas. “We are requesting all players in food security to come on board and see how they can help our people. This time around, unlike in the past, we have had three unsuccessful rain seasons and thus the coping strategies for the people are badly eroded,” Koma said. He said lack of food is causing serious malnourishment especially among children. Koma said that the peoples’ food purchasing power has gone down and prices for livestock - the only sources of income- had plummeted.
