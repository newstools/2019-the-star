I'm discovering some players' have frequent mistakes especially the old players. And that’s why I'm keen on bringing in new players. So it was a good experience to know how far my team can go. I think we are still in time to make good changes." The East Africans will now line up for the sole ticket up for grabs during the next year Continental Olympic Qualifiers in yet to be decided venue.
