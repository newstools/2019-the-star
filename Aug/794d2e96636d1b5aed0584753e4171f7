Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has said the 2022 elections are still far away and Siaya residents should waste much time about his ambitions. "I don't want Siaya politicians to have sleepless nights because they don't know what I'm thinking or my move in," Wandayi said. He said any right thinking leader should not brood over what is to come because he or she does not know whether they will alive or not. Wandayi spoke yesterday when he addressed residents in Ugunja. He said leaders should not lose focus on development and proper service delivery. Wandayi has been linked to the Siaya governor seat. Some leaders from the subcounties have endorsed him for the seat. The Siaya county assembly Majority leader asked the MP to state his position. But Wandayi said he knows what to say at the right time."Who has talked to God and has been assured that he or she will be there during the next election? he asked. "What l think and want in 2022 should not determine anyone's politics. Let everyone advance his political ambitions carefully." Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo and Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo have publicly advocated for Siaya Senator James Orengo to vie for governor. Former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo, Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga, Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda, some MCAs and residents think Wandayi can make a good governor.
