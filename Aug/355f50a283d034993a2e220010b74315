Romelu Lukaku has been bombarding former Manchester United team-mate Alexis Sanchez with messages to convince him to join Inter Milan. The Belgian striker moved to the Serie A club for £73million this summer and has been working on Sanchez every day to link up with him again. Lukaku has even been telling the 30-year-old forward that Milan is a far more beautiful place to live than Manchester. It seems his efforts are to be rewarded and Sanchez has already chosen the No 7 shirt ahead of a season-long loan move. The presence of his Chilean compatriot Gary Medel is also a persuasive factor and it is a matter of time until the deal is announced. United will still be paying half of Alexis Sanchez’s £560,000-a-week wages, according to Gazzetta dello Sport. The former Arsenal forward has struggled to justify his enormous wage at United and failed to capture his top form. Both he and Lukaku have plenty to prove this season and they would form a key part of the expected 3-5-2 formation at the San Siro. Sanchez already has experience of top-flight Italian football having spent five years on the books of Udinese and this could be his chance to resurrect his career.
