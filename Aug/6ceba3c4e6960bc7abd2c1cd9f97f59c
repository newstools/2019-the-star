A land buying co-operative society got a reprieve after the Court of Appeal ordered that all its parcels that had been illegally sold be reverted back to its ownership. The Samuru Gituto Farmers Co-operative Society that was formed in the ‘60s held its first meeting in about 15 years following the court’s directive. On March 3, the Court of Appeal ordered all cases concerning the co-operative society revived and concluded. The cases were filed after a splinter assumed leadership of the group and sold land without the members’ consent. The faction sold about 322 acres located near Thika Greens Golf Course to another group known as Gatanga Kwao. But another group led by chairman Hilum Kamau Ng’ang’a filed a case in court blocking the sale. The group also contested the election of the faction led by Francis Ndung’u. The group had a total of 1,700 acres but a big chunk of it was sold off and only the 322 acres remain. The co-operative bought the land that was under coffee plantation with the hope of making money through dividends derived from the sale of coffee production. But dwindled coffee prices and mismanagement caused the group to start operating under losses and in the mid 2000, it was unable to service loans taken from the Co-operative Bank to manage the operations of the plantations. The bank then moved in and sold off 1,200 acres of land to recover its money according to the group’s former bookkeeper John Njuguna, but the money was not enough to clear the loan.
