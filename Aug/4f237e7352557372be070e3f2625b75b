Bungoma Agriculture executive Mathews Makanda has asked Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka not to contest the region's governorship again and instead focus on bigger national positions. “Mr Speaker, I kindly plead with you not to come back here. We're praying that you continue going for higher positions,” Makanda said. He was speaking at the burial on Grace Wekesa in Sirisia on Saturday. Lusaka, who was dethroned from the governorship by current Governor Wycliffe Wangamati in 2017, was among mourners. There has been talk that Lusaka could seek to recapture the seat in 2022. The speculations have been fueled by alleged fallout between Wangamati and Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang'ula. Wangamati was elected on a Ford Kenya ticket. But residents claim he's shifted his allegiance to Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa  whose allies have formed a new political party, the Democratic Action Party. Meanwhile, Lusaka is said to be getting cosy with Wetang'ula. The Bungoma senator was instrumental in unseating Lusaka in 2017. Speaking at the funeral, Lusaka urged Makamnda not to panic and instead focus on serving residents. “You should stop panicking because this is not the right time for politics. Let's serve our people because when the right time comes, we will make proper pronouncements," Lusaka said. The former governor said he understood Makanda's fears. “I know Makanda is not genuine because he is praying that I move to a higher position so that they have an easy time here. They know that they will be sent home if I come back,” he said. Lusaka said elected leaders should focus on serving their electorates. He accused Wangmati of victimising civil servants employed under his regime. “When you succeed someone in power, you don’t go around harassing civil servants who served in the previous regimes the way we are seeing Bungoma,” Lusaka said. edited by peter obuya
