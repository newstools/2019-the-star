Mario Balotelli has signed for his home town club Brescia after putting pen to paper on a three-year deal. The former Liverpool and Manchester City striker was released by Marseille earlier this summer and had been linked moves to the Premier League and the MLS. Reports suggested that the 29-year-old also turned down a move to Brazilian side Flamengo as he was eager to reclaim a spot in the Italy squad ahead of Euro 2020. Last season Balotelli scored eight goals in 15 appearances for Marseille, having previously scored 43 goals in 76 games for Nice. Brescia, who sealed promotion to the Serie A last season, convinced Balotelli to return to Italy where he enjoyed spells at Inter Milan and AC Milan. His last appearance in the Serie A came in 2016 where he spent a season on loan at AC Milan while at Liverpool. While in England, Balotelli won the Premier League and the FA Cup with Manchester City, but he endured a miserable time at Liverpool, scoring just one league goal in 16 games during the 2014-15 season. Balotelli has been capped by Italy on 18 occasions, with his most recent call-up having come last year.
