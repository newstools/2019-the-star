Jack Wilshere is paying for physiotherapist Declan Lynch to come over from Ireland to work with him twice a week in private sessions. The 27-year-old midfielder — who played 34 times for England — has been plagued by injury in recent years. In his first season at West Ham, he made only eight Premier League appearances following his free transfer from Arsenal. It was at Arsenal where he struck up a great rapport with Lynch, who was appointed by head physio Colin Lewin in 2012. Wilshere clearly feels the sessions with Lynch, held away from the training ground, are paying dividends. And boss Manuel Pellegrini has no objection as long as he has a fit Wilshere at his disposal. Lynch left Arsenal to work at Bath rugby union club. Following his departure from the West Country, Lynch set up a clinic in Limerick in the Republic of Ireland and kept in touch with Wilshere.
