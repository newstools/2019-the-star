Steve Cram says his reaction to sprinter Christian Coleman being charged with missing three drugs tests is ‘less of surprise, more of despair’. He will be banned for one year if found guilty at an arbitration hearing on 4 September, ruling him out of the World Championships and 2020 Olympic Games. American Coleman ran the fastest 100m time in the world this year in June. “As a professional athlete, it’s your responsibility to be available for drug testing,” said BBC commentator Cram. “It’s nowhere near as difficult as it used to be so there really aren’t many excuses, although there will always be situations where things go wrong. That’s where the despair comes in. You think: really?” The US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) says a decision will be made the day after 23-year-old Coleman’s hearing. The World Championships, held in Doha, starting on 27 September. Coleman, seen by some as an heir apparent to Usain Bolt, has been charged with failing to ‘properly file his whereabouts information.’ Under the ‘whereabouts’ system, athletes must let officials know where they will be for one hour every day as well as details of overnight accommodation and training. Failure to do so three times in a 12-month period could lead to a rule violation under the World Anti-Doping Code. Coleman has said that ‘what has been widely reported concerning filing violations is simply not true’, adding that he is ‘confident’ the Usada hearing will ‘clear the matter’. British former 400m Olympic champion Christine Ohuruogu received a year’s ban in 2006 for missing three tests.
