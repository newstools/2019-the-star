Arrow Bwoy will be launching his debut album, titled 'Hatua', on Friday at Carnivore, Simba Salon. 'Hatua' is a 14-track album with one bonus track. 'Hatua' features Kenyan and international collaborations with artistes like Demarco and Cecile (Jamaica), Mayorkun (Nigeria), Fena Gitu and Wyre from Kenya. Speaking ahead of the debut, Arrow Bwoy said he has been working on the album for a long time. "I am excited to release my work to the fans to hear what I've been working on," he said during a listening party on Thursday at Golden Bistro club. "When I made my first hit, the reception was good and I'm quite sure the reaction to 'Hatua' will be awesome." A month ago, Arrow Bwoy released a single off the album titled 'Ngeta'. The album is already on Songa Music App.
