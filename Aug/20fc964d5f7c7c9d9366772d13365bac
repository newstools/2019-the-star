Manchester United have agreed to send Alexis Sanchez on loan to Inter Milan. The Italians have agreed to pay around £4.5million of the Chile international’s £21m annual salary and there is no obligation to make the deal permanent. Sanchez is due to team up with former team-mate Romelu Lukaku. Talks between the two clubs have been ongoing for some time, and it was initially reported that United were keen for Inter to include a £20m obligation to buy in the deal. That is now not the case, and although they could yet make the deal permanent, the San Siro club are not planning on offering Sanchez anything more than £150,000 per week. His temporary departure from United ends a nightmare chapter in the 30-year old’s career. Sanchez snubbed a move to Premier League champions Manchester City for a more lucrative contract with United in January 2018 when he joined in a swap deal that saw Henrikh Mkhitaryan join Arsenal. However, glimpses of the qualities that attracted United to Sanchez have been scarce. He struggled to make an impact under Jose Mourinho and has fared little better under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Overall he scored five goals in 45 appearances while earning around £400,000 a week. The scale of his contract and his subsequent displays disrupted the financial climate in United’s dressing room as his team-mates’ agents sought parity. Though a dedicated professional, he has often cut a solitary figure around United’s training ground preferring his own company though mingling occasionally with United’s Spanish-speaking contingent. Solskjaer will now look to give teenager Mason Greenwood a chance to make an impression on the first team while a move for Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho is planned for next year.
