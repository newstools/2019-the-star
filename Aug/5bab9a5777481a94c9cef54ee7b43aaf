Residents and traders in Meru have accused the government of imposing a curfew during census resulting in losses in their businesses. Traders at Makutano and Meru town said police officers enforcing the order that all bars be closed. They close their bars at 5pm. Clothes and shoes sellers at Makutano, a 24-hour business town, said they close their businesses early for fear of being arrested. Meru town chief Mercy Murithi told the Star that people are cooperating with census officials. She said security is tight. Two enumerators are escorted by one police officer and area manager. She said Kabonokia sect, which threatened enumerators during the pre-listing, agreed to be counted after getting a warning from the authorities. Trader Jacinta Kabee said she is afraid of staying at work late due to heavy presence of armed officers. She said police officers are not meant to disrupt the economy but support traders in improving livelihoods. “We are not al Shabab and this counting is not a one day exercise. Why are we forced to close our businesses early? I always start business at 4pm. My children may sleep hungry if such order is extended,” she said. There was little activity the town which is popular with commercial sex workers.  Bars and entertainment places were closed. Former MCA James Mugambi said the order to close clubs was well meant to ensure residents go home for counting. Mugambi said Meru businessmen and residents are law abiding and this is why all the bars were closed after Interior CS Fred Matiang’I ordered  their closer for two days during the census. “I am happy with the order because people will get time for their families.  Traders will make losses but census is very important for planning” he said. Ntima acting chief Daniel Ntarahick said the  census has been going on smoothly.
