National table tennis players have blamed lack of exposure for their dismal performance in the opening events of the ongoing All Africa Games. Speaking after crushing out in the mixed doubles, the players said they would need more exposure as a team to thrive in some of the events. “Yes, we have benefited in terms of scholarships at the individual level but that is not enough. In fact, having some of these foreign coaches come down to Kenya will not only help us a lot but also change the matrix in the game,” said the team captain Josiah Wandera. He said as much they have the talent and the know-how in the game, the technical aspect is lacking and that is why receiving coaching services from top table tennis countries will help. Wandera said they still have a number of events this week including individual and men’s doubles and hopes to pull surprises. He said with a little bit of government support, Kenyans can also compete with top nations at par. “We need improved facilities if we are to keep pace with the foreign legion,” he said. Coach Fahd Daim said their focus right is on the youth and that is why they have the likes of 11-year-old Jenny compel in the team. “I can still play and maybe win Kenya something but we are looking at a long term program. We can’t be doing things the same way and expect different results,” he added. He said some of the players including Brian Mutua who is on the IOC scholarship has shown growth and this has really inspired the rest of the team.
