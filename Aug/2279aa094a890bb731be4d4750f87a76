There is a lot of talk about the referendum and which politicians support it and which politicians oppose it. On Saturday Majority Leader Aden Duale, a close associate of Deputy President William Ruto, said that he now supports the referendum for a parliamentary system. Duale's argument was that a parliamentary system would give a politician from a small tribe like the Digo the chance to become president. However, there are counter-arguments against the parliamentary system. How would you guard against a powerful Prime Minister staying in power indefinitely by buying the loyalty of MPs? And what parliamentary system are we talking about? Some proposals seem to be for a hybrid where there is an executive Prime Minister but where the President still calls the shots. This is not to say the parliament system is good or bad. Like the presidential system, it has pros and cons. But it is premature to say today that you support or oppose the referendum because we don't know what the vote will be about. It might be for a hybrid or a full parliamentary system. It might be anything. Quote of the day: "Something must be done to save humanity! A better world is possible!" Fidel CastroThe Cuban president was born on 13 August, 1926
