ODM party leader Raila Odinga has responded to politicians who have been mounting pressure on him to endorse  Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i for the presidency in 2022. Speaking in Nyaribari Masaba Constituency during the burial of former area MP Hezron Manduku on Friday, Raila described the CS as his son and as a father, he understands what is best for him. “Matiang’i is my son and I know he deserves the best. Go slow, I know how to plan on this,” Raila said. Raila said it was too early to start engaging in succession politics and when the time was ripe he would make endorsements. "If we start campaigning now we will not be any different from the other team. Let's focus on development and allow Matiang'i to serve us. His role now is more important,"he said. He called for time to allow him, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Matiang'i to unite Kenyans through the handshake. "2022 if far. Let's put politics aside. Time is coming. We are committed to uniting Kenyans. Let's avoid early campaigns. The best time for politics is ahead," said Raila. Matiang'i, however, who was in attendance avoided politics and assured that he is committed to his job as a CS. "It's my time to work. If it's closing all bars to count people, that is it and we mean business. I know you want me to say something, but I will say when the right time comes," he said. "I must work very hard so that I don't shame my God and my community at large. Lets always work in truth and serve this country." Other leaders present were Kisii Governor James Ongwae,  Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama, Senators Sam Ongeri (Kisii), Okong’o Omogeni (nyamira)  and Kisii Woman Representative Janet Ongera, Borabu MP Ben Momanyi and Kitutu Chache North MP Jimmy Angwenyi.
