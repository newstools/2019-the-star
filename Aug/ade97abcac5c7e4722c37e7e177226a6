Police are looking for Joseph Mwangi Nduta, alias Joe Mwangi for forgery of a letting claiming to have originated from a cabinet secretary. Police said on Friday that Joe allegedly forged a letter threatening Magdalene Mbele, the mother of Wendy Waeni, of "some consequences". Waeni, an acrobat, caught the attention of the public after revealing that Mwangi, her ex-manager, was swindling her from shows she has been performing both locally and internationally. After the media highlighted Wendy's issue, Mwangi came out claiming that she was spreading falsehoods and disparaging his character. Joe denied claims that he had been travelling with Wendy during world tours. He claims there are interested parties who are out to malign him. The office of the Director of Criminal Investigations stepped in after KOT demanded action over Mwangi's alleged exploitation of Wendy. On August 9, DCI said that the matter was being investigated by the Child Protection Unit. DCI added that action will be taken should Mwangi be found guilty.
