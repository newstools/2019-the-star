Stray Lions and Swamibapa have beefed up their squad ahead of their second-round matches of the Nairobi Invitational 50 Overs League. Stray Lions, the 2017 Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) Super League champions have brought on board Shushil Sharma, Shabbir Shaikh and Durvesh Sanjay ahead of this weekend’s match, away to Nairobi Gymkhana. The three are joining the club with a lot of experience from India. Sanjay and Sharma have all played top cricket in Mumbai while Sheikh has been at Baroda. Last year, Stray Lions had a torrid campaign in the NPCA season and it was the same story at the Hirani Telecom Cup where they finished bottom of the pile. Club secretary Thota Srinivas said the trio’s arrival will be a big boost as they try to get back to their glory days. He added that trio, in addition to being actively involved on the pitch, will also be tasked to coach the young players to facilitate a smooth transition. “We will have these players involved in coaching too. We have already identified the kids that they will work with and we are optimistic that their involvement will play a key role in the growth of the game in the country,” Srinivas said. Swamibapa have signed up Dhwanil Patil and Rakesh Kahar, also from India. While Kahar will be returning to Swamibapa while Patil is a new entrant. The Swamis are seeking a 50 over silverware for the first time in over five years. Swamibapa play hosts Ruaraka this weekend.
