Gary Neville believes Manchester United will lift the Premier League again before Liverpool win their first title. Despite finishing 31 points behind the European champions last season, Neville does not think his former side are that far away from being kings of England again. “I can guarantee you as clear as day, Manchester United will win again. They’ll probably win the league before Liverpool, in my opinion,” he said on Sky Bet’s Big Debate. “And that’s not being disrespectful, they’ll probably win the league before Liverpool.” When asked whether he was bothered by the improvement of others, Neville said: “It genuinely does not concern me because it can be corrected by a little bit of money on the stadium and good decisions in the boardroom and good decisions in the recruitment department.” “What I’m saying is, Liverpool, City, Tottenham , all these clubs have had poor recruitment policies over the last 25 or 30 years at times. So United are going through one at the moment.” “Eventually they will stumble upon the right recruitment system, the right recruitment people, they’ll get a great manager — hopefully that’s Ole — and they’ll start to win again. That’s going to happen.” Liverpool are still waiting to end their 29-year drought after finishing second last year, while United have not lifted the trophy since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013.
