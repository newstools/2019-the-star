Two Manyani prison officials were on Monday nabbed by Voi detectives hiding cocaine in a toilet. In a tweet shared by the DCI, the two suspects, Boniface Korir and William Chengo were also found in possession of ammunition without authority. Their arrest comes a day after a senior police officer in Lamu was held by detectives over a similar incident. Chief Inspector Shadrack Mumo who is the OCS for the Kizingitini police station was held in connection with the release of a massive consignment of drugs that had just been nabbed by officers. He is said to have received a Sh50,000 bribe to release the haul and the owner, a wanted drug kingpin in the region.
