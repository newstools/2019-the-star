This is the second time in the past 12 months the cost of living measure has gone beyond the six per cent mark after hitting 6.58 per cent in April. The increase has seen the cost of items such as sifted maize floor- a Kenyan staple- rise 16 per cent to Sh119.89 per 2-kg packet compared to Sh102.50 last July.
