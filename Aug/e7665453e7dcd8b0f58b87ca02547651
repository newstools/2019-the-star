Six Kisumu assembly MCAs have been summoned by ODM's disciplinary committee for violating party principles and trying to undermine Governor Anyang' Nyong'o . They are to appear on Friday at Kisumu Central ODM party office. Those summoned are Majority leader Kenneth Onyango, Chief Whip Gard Olima, the Deputy Speaker Roy Samo, Nominated MCAs Jane Manuche, Nyangoya Oguok and Caleb Omoro.   The six are to answer to different allegations and are liberty to be accompanied by their legal counsel. In a letter seen by the Star, Samo is accused of convening a press conference and calling Deputy Governor Mathews Owili, an ODM member, a 'flower girl' who has not been chairman of a cattle dip. Olima is accused of failing to whip members to back the county government agenda in the assembly and instead whipping them to jointly oppose the administration agenda. He has also been accused of convening and participating in a press conference where the top county leadership and senor party members were maligned in public. â€œYou are invited to appear before the committee on Friday, August 30 at 10.30am to respond to the issues raised," read the letter copied to the party leader Raila Odinga, secretary general Edwin Sifuna and the Kisumu county ODM chair. The nominated MCAs are also accused of not supporting party ideologies and interests in the assembly. However, some sources claim the summons relates to the impeachment of Finance CEC Nerry Achar, despite party various calls not to impeach officers. The MCAs had claimed that Achar was failing the county as a whole. She refused to quit. A section of residents told the Star, the party should let the MCAs perform their oversight role and ensure adequate services. The summons follows the part's county delegates conference at Tom Mboya Labour College where various leaders, including the MCAs, were warned against violating the party's wishes and directives.
