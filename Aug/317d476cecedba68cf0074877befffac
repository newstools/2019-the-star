ANC deputy leader Ayub Savula has defended Musalia Mudavadi against claims he is working with Deputy President William Ruto to oppose constitutional changes. Savula on Thursday termed reports that the ANC party leader will team up with Ruto to block the Building Bridges Initiative as untrue and misleading. The BBI is a product of the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. "Some people are hell-bent on spinning cheap propaganda to portray Mudavadi as serving the interests of DP Ruto. Mudavadi will be going up to the ballot and cannot work with an opponent," he told the Star on the phone. Savula said ANC was laying ground on how to win the Kibra parliamentary by-election to shore up Mudavadi's image among other potential presidential candidates." Party secretary general Barrack Muluka was quoted in a section of the media saying that ANC will team up with Ruto to oppose the referendum to change the Constitution. Muluka has, however, denied the claims saying he was quoted out of context. He added that Mudavadi will on Friday lead the ANC fraternity to Makueni county where he will be hosted by Governor Kivutha Kibwana to explore ways of expanding ANC to Ukambani ahead of 2022. Mudavadi on Wednesday unveiled Raila's 2013 election campaign manager Eliud Owalo as the party's flagbearer for Kibra. On Thursday, Savula said the media should stop profiling politicians based on their support for the BBI report "because it has not yet been made public for us to decide what to do". "We shall meet as ANC family once the report is out and study it before coming up with a stand on the referendum," he said. Savula said ANC supports President Kenyatta's drive to unify the country for economic prosperity. He said Mudavadi was developing strategies on how to accommodate governors serving their second term in his winning plan. We're focused on making Mudavadi the next president and shadowboxing is not part of our business, he said. Edited by R.Wamochie
