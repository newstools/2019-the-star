Kibra aspirant reggae DJ and MC Chrispinus Odhiambo, alias Kriss Darlin, has been urged to present his agendas to the people. This is after he knelt before ODM party leader Raila Odinga in a public rally at Kamukunji grounds, Kibra, asking him to endorse him. "What was that Kriss Darlin?" Classic 105 presenter Mwalimu King'ang'i said during the breakfast show. "Look for four main agendas and present them to the people. And the people will vote for you. Stop kneeling before Raila. Otherwise kitakulemea." Speaking at the rally, Darlin said, “I have heard that there are many young men in Parliament fighting Baba (Raila). Allow me as their fellow youth to go fight them in there as you wait to fight in 2022.”
