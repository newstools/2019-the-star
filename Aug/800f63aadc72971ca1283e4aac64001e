Juventus midfielder Aaron Ramsey will miss Wales’ forthcoming international fixtures against Azerbaijan and Belarus. The Football Association of Wales announced the news on Tuesday, though no reason was given. It is believed, though, that Ramsey’s absence may be due to his lacking of match fitness. The 28-year-old has made only one full appearance since April after picking up a hamstring injury at former club Arsenal. Ramsey missed Juventus’ season opener with Parma after a summer of recovering from the hamstring injury. He did play 15 minutes of a pre-season friendly against Triestina, however, but his first-team debut remains pending. Manchester United youngster Dylan Levitt steps up from the Under-21 squad to replace Wales’ star midfielder. Ryan Giggs will understandably lament the absence of his star man as his side face an uphill task to qualify for next summer’s European Championships. Wales are currently fourth in their qualifying group behind Slovakia, Hungary and World Cup finalists Croatia. They host Azebaijan on September 6 in desperate need of points to keep their Euro 2020 hopes alive.  They then face Belarus in a friendly.
