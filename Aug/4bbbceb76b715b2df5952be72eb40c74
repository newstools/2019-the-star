The Anti-Stock Theft police officer who was shot by bandits on Friday in Wangwachi, Laikipia West, is out of danger. The officer was injured during a fierce fire exchange between the bandits and the security personnel. "The officer was shot in the shoulder and has since been airlifted to Nairobi for specialised treatment," Laikipia West deputy county commissioner Benedict Munywoki said on Friday. Yesterday, Laikipia county police commander Maxwell Nyaema said the officer was recuperating at home. He was part of a contingent of security officers that was pursuing a gang of about 20 rustlers, who had raided a village and fled with livestock. On July 12, 2017, six police officers were shot dead during a banditry attack in Kamwenje area, Laikipia West, with four others sustaining bullet wounds after they were ambushed by more than 100 rustlers along the Baringo-Laikipia border. In February of the same year, Laikipia West division police boss Melengo Muherai was shot and seriously wounded while driving away illegal grazers at Kifuku ranch, Rumuruti town in Laikipia West.
