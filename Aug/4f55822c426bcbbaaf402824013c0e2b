Homeboyz Radio has caused a stir online by unleashing their top 50 best hip hop personalities of the year. The list was premiered on Corrine Onyango and Jinx’s show. Young artistes topped the list, which stirred mixed reactions. Jinx told Word Is that's because of the uphill task they had of driving Naija music out of our market. "It’s a significant cultural shift that cannot be ignored.” Hip hop in Kenya has been defined by sub-genres Genge, Kapuka, Shrapuka and Genge. IG user De Noo termed the list an insult to Kenyan hip hop. "Kalamashaka performed to a sold-out show in Lagos, Nigeria, long before Bishop Deya had miracle babies," he said. Job Joab Jb added, "You are doing injustice to these legends aki. My stomach aches when reading that list why lie."
