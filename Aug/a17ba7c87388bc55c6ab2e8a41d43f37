The formalities of the past few days are complete and it's all systems go as drivers prepare to embark on the fifth round of the KCB National Rally Championship in Mount Kenya region today Event Director Bimal Patel said Nanyuki Rally will be flagged off this morning outside KCB Nanyuki branch. Bimal added that the event is designed with the safety of competitors and spectators in mind. "Spectators can catch up with the flag off in town then proceed to Batian View where the action starts at 10 am. The 2.3km Batian View Stage will be the designated spectator viewing point as the other two sections – Loldaiga Hills and Ndovu will be closed to spectators for safety reasons," said Bimal. Loldaiga has over the years been synonymous with Nanyuki Rally since the club held their first KNRC in 1998 which was won by the late Jonathan Toroitich. Meanwhile, Nanyuki town centre was a beehive of activities. While mechanics and team managers presented their team machines to the technical delegate, Musa Locho for pre-event scrutinising at Cedar Mall, drivers went through reconnaissance where wet conditions were reported. "The route is partially wet and dry in some parts so this promises to be a scintillating test between man and machine. It’s been some time since we drove the Evolution 10 car. We had a long repair period after the Safari breakdown. We also couldn’t make it to Kilifi," noted Bengi. After flag off,  drivers will embark on a  12.11km transport road section through to Loldaiga Hills where they will tackle a 31.43km stage. The rally traffic will then traverse a 3.58km transport through to CS2 46.15km Ndovu which is the event's longest stage. The 2.3km third stage at Batian View on the foothills of Mount Kenya, is the shortest and the designated spectator viewing point. The three stages will be repeated twice to make up total distance of 287km of which 159km will be competitive and 127km transport. Ian Duncan’s crowd-pleasing Toyota Hilux pickup will be the first off the ramp at 7 am ahead of 25 other cars. Duncan will be navigated by veteran Tej Sehmi and will also score points for the non-homologous Specially Prepared Vehicles (SPV) category which has attracted the likes Geoff Mayes in a Land Rover and physically challenged Nikhil Sachania in a hand-controlled Mitsubishi Lancer EvolutionX. Second off the ramp will be defending champion and five times Safari Rally winner Carl 'Flash' Tundo and his partner Tim Jessop in a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 10 after. Tundo missed out on Kilifi Rally earlier in the month due to family and is determined to make amends in his favorite rally. Runaway leader, Baldev Chager is seeded third ahead of back to back reigning African champion Manvir Baryan in a Skoda Fabia R5. Manvir’s  Skoda was out of this world in Kilifi and has since swept the ground with all its opponents across the African continent. Onkar Rai on his second outing in the VW Polo is seeded fifth ahead of his elder sibling Tejveer Rai, Jasmeet Chana and Eric Bengi. This year’s event has attracted 8 drivers in the KNRC Premier Class, 7 in the Division One category and 6 in Division 2. What’s more, several drivers will be seeking vital points to enhance their championship hopes in their respective classes. Daren Miranda leads the Formula Two Championship in his speciality as he nurses dreams of winning his maiden title in his longstanding rallying career. Tuta Mionki and Suzanne Zwager, are the only female rally drivers in the competition. Tuta is navigating Eric Bengi and Zwager is calling the notes for Geoff Mayes.
