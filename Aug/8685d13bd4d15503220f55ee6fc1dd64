The Bureau of Statistics coordinator in charge of Kiambu county has praised security agents for supporting census teams. Willy Konde told the press on Sunday evening that the enumerators were doing a good job owing to the protection they received. He said work was progressing well and no tablets were stolen. “We have about 9,000 personnel on the ground and we expect to deliver,” he said He said census teams met some resistance at gated communities where security guards did not allow enumerators in at night. They returned the following to count residents' households. Konde said those who had not been counted would be reached within the week before the deadline on August 31. He praised people for asking questions about the census and the questions asked. “It is good when the citizens also ask our staff questions and probe for in-depth information, Konde said. To hasten the county the national government directed the census to continue nonstop from 6pm to 6am. Kiambu county commissioner Wilson Wanyanga said the cumulative data should be compared with the earlier listed number of households in sublocations. (Edited b V. Graham)
