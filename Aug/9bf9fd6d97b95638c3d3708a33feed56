Marsabit Deputy Governor Solomon Gubo has urged youth to explore available opportunities, including sports, to better their lives. He said the county government will continue supporting policies that will help transform youth. Gubo said a policy, which was launched by the governor, would promote youth participation in community and civic affairs. Saku MP Dido Ali Raso urged the youth to focus on gainful activities such as sports. He appealed to Saku residents to ensure they are counted in the ongoing census. He said the constituency is among 27 that do not meet the population criteria set out in the Constitution, and risk being merged if it fails to meet the threshold. The MP also raised concerns about the stalled Marsabit Stadium. He promised to raise the matter in Parliament once furnished with all the details. County secretary Malich Boru assured county youths of the government's commitment to support their agendas.
