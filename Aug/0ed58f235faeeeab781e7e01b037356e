The Makande Estate near Makupa Causeway in Mombasa is an epidemic about to explode. Children are playing on the wet ground filled with greenish raw sewage. Residents ‘hop, skip and jump’ pools of stinking raw sewers all over the once magnificent estate. The stench is so strong that I had to hold my breath as I watched children playing on wet sticky ground. To make it even worse, it is just near the Hussein Bakery which is famous for soft bread and sweet cakes. Something should be done about the estate before diseases break out.  Mombasa
