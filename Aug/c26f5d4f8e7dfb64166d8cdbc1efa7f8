National coach Julius Kirwa believes Kenya can take sprints to the next level with proper support. Kirwa said as a country, Kenya have very good sprinters and all that is needed is to change the mentality towards the disciplines. “We seem not to take sprints seriously and that is not good for the country,” he noted. He said sprints can be a good alternative for the winning fortunes in some of the long-distance events including the 10,000m. “The teams here have proved that sprints can be the next big thing for Kenya and I think we need to focus on them,” he noted. He revealed that the sprinters are very committed and eager to learn. The tactician said for a start, the sprinters need a dedicated camp to work on their weak points. Besides, they need around 10 coaches to monitor their improvement and work with them on their weakness. “Alternatively, we can have the same coaches visiting them wherever they train across the country in a bid to sharpen on their skills,” he added. He said there is a lot of potential in sprints if the results here in Rabat is anything to go by. “Alphas Kishoyian and Mary Moraa missed a medal by a whisker while the women’s 4x100m won a bronze medal, beating some of the renown names in sprints. This is a clear message for us to capitalise on the situation and diversify our scope,” he added. He said we need not depend on middle and long-distance disciplines alone where competition is now proving to be cut-throat. He said field events would be another area to build on with the likes of Olympic silver medalist Julius Yego and Africa Games high jump champion Mathew Sawe having proved that we can do it. He said the two have inspired many other athletes who just need a little push to perform at the top level. “Like in sprints, field event is another virgin area which we need to exploit. We can’t sit on a gold mine and do nothing,” he said. The coach said he is ready to lead the revolution in sprints and field if given the necessary support.
