Manchester United’s plans to sell Alexis Sanchez to Inter Milan look set to be placed on hold while the club waits for news on Anthony Martial’s thigh injury. The Frenchman picked up a knock during the recent 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace at Old Trafford, causing concern among Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s coaching staff. Martial has undertaken scans on the injured area, and United will wait for the results to come in before deciding what should be done with Sanchez, according to the Guardian. Following the defeat Solskjaer played down the injury to Martial, and another of his team-mates in Luke Shaw. “We’ll have to wait and see,” said the Norwegian. “Hopefully they won’t be too bad and maybe we can have them training during the week.” Martial was seen limping at the end of the match, and any possible long-term absence is likely to keep Sanchez at Old Trafford. The £52million signing has endured a tumultuous time in Manchester since joining in January 2018, netting only three times in 32 appearances, while struggling to find consistency for Solskjaer’s side. A move away has been viewed as the most positive step for all parties involved.  But the San Siro club are planning on offering Sanchez a contract worth no more than £150,000-per-week if they decide to make the deal permanent next summer.
