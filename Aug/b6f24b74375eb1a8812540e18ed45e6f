Residents of West Pokot county have been warned against engaging themselves in forest destructing activities. West Pokot county ecosystem conservator Allan Ongere condemned alleged destruction of a 15-acre forest plantation by locals. Ongere addressed residents of Lomuge area in Pokot South subcounty during a tree-planting exercise yesterday. The drive was organised by the Kenya Forest Research Institute and Kenya Forest Service. “It is very alarming that a total of 15-acre young forest plantation was uprooted in Kanyaltin by residents. To those who think they can walk away with such illegal activities, we will deal with you according to the law," Ongere said. The conservator said that the KFS faces many challenges of forest encroachment, charcoal burning, overgrazing and other illegal activities like alcohol brewing inside the forest in the region. He called on the locals to be the grassroots watchdogs through joining the Community Forest Association, saying it will also benefit them. Through their area chief, residents lamented rising cases of 'changaa' brewing in Kapkanyar Forest after the perpetrators were flushed out from the villages by the wananchi and police. “I understand that the forest area has been converted into an illicit brewing den. This is unacceptable and soon action will be taken,” he said West Pokot county environment and natural resources chief officer Alex Lokimoi condemned illegal destruction of forests in the county. He cited human action as the source of the drought experienced in the region this year. "Kenya without forest cover is like a person walking naked in broad daylight, it is sad we are tirelessly working to correct that," he said. Lokimoi further urged the residents to venture into tree planting as a long term economic activity. He promised that the county government would provide free seedlings to willing farmers.
