The Employment and Labour Relations Court has stopped Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok from removing two county executives from office. Gender and Social Services executive Benard Ng'eno and his Administration, ICT and Public Service counterpart Justus Maina got a reprieve when the court blocked   their removal. The court also barred the governor from interfering with their contracts. The two are part of six CECs who served under former Governor Joyce Laboso who died of cancer on july 29. They were voted out during a special sitting at the county assembly last week. The decision by the Judge Bryan Ongaya now means that the two will continue enjoying the benefits of their contracts until the case is heard and determined. The ruling also means that the governor will not nominate or appoint and person to fill the vacant positions held by the two executives. The judge also barred the county assembly from considering the name of any person for purposes of vetting and approval to serve in the positions held by the two. Bomet county assembly and Speaker Shadrack Rotich have been named as the first and second respondents in the case, respectively, while Governor Barchok is an interested party. “That pending the hearing of the petition-inter parties-a conservatory order issue staying the decision of the county assembly to remove or recommend the removal of the petitioners from office as the county executive committee members,” read the orders in part. The case has now been set for inter-parties hearing on September 9. Justice Ongaya further cautioned the respondents against disobeying the orders noting that they risk being cited for contempt of court. The two are represented by lawyer Peter Wanyama.
