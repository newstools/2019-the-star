A Nairobi club board member resigned on Monday and recommended that the board work on letting the management and board do their respective work. Allen Kimani Ndung'u said, "The main committee’s role is supposed to be an oversight, supervisory and decision making... implementation is the work of management. There is a serious loss of staff morale when the main committee takes over management’s role." Ndung'u said that any opportunity to build the team and its cohesiveness should be grabbed and encouraged. He added that conflict of interest, whether perceived or real, should always be guarded against as a first principle. "Besides, the board ends up losing focus on strategic and policy issues that are meant to guarantee long term sustainability of the club. In this regard, Ndung'u said the process of recruiting a substantive CEO and professional managers of key functions should be expedited on a priority basis.
