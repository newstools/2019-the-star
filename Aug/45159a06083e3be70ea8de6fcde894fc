Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei has been released on personal bond. Cherargei has said the remarks he made over the weekend concerning support for Deputy President William Ruto's 2022 bid, and which led to his arrest, were misinterpreted. He said Kisumu DCI detectives questioned him about the meaning of the words he used.  The senator said DCI officials took him through the dictionary and and kamusi seeking the meaning of the words used. He spoke at Kisumu DCI on Tuesday after being released as investigations continue. Cherargei said he has always supported peace and will always support the President and Deputy President. " As elected leader andÂ  Senator of Nandi county I always stand for the peace and open democratic society for the benefit of all Kenyans," Cherargei said. He called upon Nandi residents to desist from taking his interrogation as political witch hunt. "These are just routine investigations. But we should desist from turning this into political persecution because of our political affiliation," Senator said. Nandi Governor Stephen Sang who had visited the senator asked DCI to be impartial as they handle issues relating to inflammatory remarks made by political leaders. " I am appalled by DCI's supersonic speed in regards to Cherargei's case, while they have failed to act on far more inflammatory statements made by other political leaders in the country," Sang said. He has urged politicians to be cautious and to avoid making statements which could spark animosity. Cherargei was picked from his home on Tuesday morning by the detectives after refusing to open the gate. DCI had summoned him on Monday to record statement over alleged hate speech remarks that he had made during the function over the weekend.
