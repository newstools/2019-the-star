"It's quite a good feeling winning our first event of the 2019 KNRC season. The stages were rushing in nice and we were very fast on the 21km section. We also spun on the last run of the 21km and lost a few seconds but still won the stage. We now want to achieve a big dream in the KNRC," said Manvir's navigator Sturrock. Chager still leads the KNRC series despite finishing second. "It was a very tough rally but very enjoyable stages. The traffic was well controlled. We tried to push and keep up with the Skoda so we beat Manvir on CS3 and he beat us again on CS4 with three seconds. In the long 46km stage at Bamba we were pushing extra hard then went off and got stuck for several minutes. Two weeks we are headed for Nanyuki Rally so the boys have a lot of work to do. " Chager said. Geoff Mayes retired at the start of SS 2 with engine problems Adil Mirza also retired in stage 2.
