The national government has allocated funds for rehabilitation of the ancient Vasco Dagama pillar and protection of other key historical sites and monuments. Sports and Culture CS Amina Mohamed said the money was set aside through the sports development funds after the President signed the Sports Act into law. Amina who is currently on a tour of the Coast region’s ancient historical sites and monuments said the government is already building a sea wall at Fort Jesus in Mombasa. Speaking after a tour of Gedi Ruins on Monday, the CS said the government was committed in protecting historical sites and monuments as they were key centres for promoting country’s heritage. "Vasco Dagama pillar rehabilitation  will begin. Some little money has been set aside for the project. We are also building a sea wall at the Fort Jesus. The aim is to make sure historical sites are taken care of and protected," she said. Currently, there are huge cracks on the 521-year-old pillar and experts had warned  it could fall into the Indian Ocean if action is not taken. The CS said she could not immediately reveal the amount set aside for the rehabilitation of the ancient pillar or the total allocation for protecting historical sites and monuments. However, she said the ministry has made proposals and expressed optimism that funds would soon be disbursed. Vasco Da Gama pillar which was built by the Portuguese explorer in 1498 is under threat. Amina arrived in Malindi on Sunday and toured the Malindi Museum and then visited the pillar which is a key tourist attraction in the resort town. On Tuesday she visited Gedi Ruins where she was taken through the historic site and later saw the Kipepeo project which exports butterflies abroad. Athman Hussein, the National Museums of Kenya assistant director in charge of museums at the Coast, said they were progressing well in the management of the historical sites despite the challenges.
