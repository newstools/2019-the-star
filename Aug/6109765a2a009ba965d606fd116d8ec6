A Standard Three pupil on Wednesday died at Lwala village in Suba North constituency after she was buried alive in a quarry. Doreen Akinyi, 12, had gone to collect soil for smearing their mud-walled house when tragedy struck. Akinyi, a pupil at Kuge Primary School, was in the company of her sister. Residents said a few minutes after the girl began digging soil inside the quarry, the weak wall collapsed on her. She was buried in soil. Ngodhe assistant chief Charles Ngoe said efforts by residents to rescue the girl were unsuccessful. "Residents tried to remove the soil but found the girl dead,” Ngoe said. The girl's body was retrieved and taken to Kirindo mortuary. Ngo told parents to stop sending their children into quarries. He said the matter was reported at Mbita police station. “Quarries are dangerous for children especially during the rainy season,” he said.
