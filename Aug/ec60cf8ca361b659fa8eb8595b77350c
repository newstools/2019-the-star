Kenya finished second with 10 gold medals, 11 silvers and 6 bronze medals while Uganda bagged 11 Gold Medals, 9 silver and 7 bronze medals Rwanda completed the podium finish with 2 gold medals, 2 silver and 6 bronze medals as hosts Tanzania finished fourth with 1 sliver and 4 bronze medal while Zanzibar and Malawi finished in fifth and sixth positions respectively without any medals at their disposal. Reacting on the performance Kenya Secondary School Sports Associations Secretary General David Ngugi said they will come back better next year since Kenya will be hosting the event. “Truth be told, Uganda are coming up pretty well and that’s the competition we are looking forward to. We were tied on points on Friday night but the loss in boys basketball against Uganda in the finals on Saturday saw Kenya settle for second position but all is not yet lost,” said Ngugi. He added, "The best part of all this is that we will be hosting the next year event and we intend to reclaim the trophy and win as many disciplines as possible. But we need to go back to the drawing as far as Football both boys and girls as well as boys volleyball concerned .These disciplines we have been dipping day in day out in the recent past.” Dagoretti basketball team succumbed to Jinja Secondary School 72-58 in the finals that were played on Saturday.
