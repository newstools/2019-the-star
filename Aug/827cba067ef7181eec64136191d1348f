Stanbic Mwamba has signed a new one year renewable footwear sponsorship deal with Kenya's authentic running shoes Enda Sportswear. Yesterday's deal is Enda Sportswear's first with a rugby team and club players will be donning the trendy sneakers during their 2019/2020 season campaign. Enda Sportswear chief executive Navalayo Osembo was happy to support the club's dream of becoming the nation's top rugby team. He said: "As Enda Footwear's first partnership with a rugby team, we are proud to support Stanbic Mwamba's quest to be the best team and provide state of the earth high-performance footwear to the talented roster of athletes. We share the vision of the club and we hope that our partnership will help both parties  to excel." Mwamba's strength and conditioning coach Jeff Onyango noted that the partnerships will help the team prepare for the upcoming season. " Most rugby fans do see players in boots during actual matches but little do they know that rugby players spend 80% of general preparations, training and drills in flats, i.e running shoes. Our speed development, acceleration, plyometrics and agility runs must be done in trainers," said Onyango. He continued: "Unfortunately here in Kenya apart from semi professional rugby players, others train in boots hence lots of lower extremities injuries-Achilles, plantar, front knee's syndrome, shin splints and tight calves. The situation is grave. These injuries are avoidable with proper footwear." The men's 7s  team was provided with 25 pairs of Iten brand, the most popular brand under Enda Sportswear. It is crafted for a natural mid-foot strike and faster training runs. Great ground-feel and flexibility help build foot-strength and let you get the most from your workouts.
