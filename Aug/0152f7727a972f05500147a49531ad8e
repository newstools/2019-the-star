Upon interrogation, they failed to explain the purpose of the arrest. Enquiries ongoing," the tweet from the Criminal Investigation unit reads.

Police officers are generally allowed to use necessary means to make an arrest or defend themselves. However, they are bound by laws about when and how to use force. This includes use of force only when non-violent means are ineffective or without any promise of achieving the intended result. "The force used shall be proportional to the objective to be achieved, the seriousness of the offence, and the resistance of the person against whom it is used, and only to the extent necessary while adhering to the provisions of the law and the Standing Orders," the Police Act reads.
