The firm also reported a financial value in earnings to shareholders rose to Sh62.49 billion from Sh55.28 billion and social externalities rise by more than Sh200 billion through M-Pesa, jobs and social investments. Environment externalities, however, rose to Sh412.3 million from Sh258.5 million due to a 3.8 per cent increase in carbon emissions. “The true value assessment shows that the value created for Kenyan society in March 2019 was Sh601 billion, 10.7 per cent from the contribution made in the same period ending 2018."
