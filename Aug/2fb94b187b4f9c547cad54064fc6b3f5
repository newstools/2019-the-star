A section of Knut officials has stormed the union headquarters demanding the removal of secretary general Wilson Sossion. Riot police had to be called in to manage the situation from getting out of hand. Sossion on Wednesday directed the closure of the union's offices from August 28 to September 3. He added that the constitution allows him as the secretary general to postpone the National Executive Council meeting. " Within my power as secretary general given by the constitution, I did postponed the NEC meeting," Sossion said. Knut's NEC meeting  had been scheduled for Thursday 29th, only to be called off by the secretary general on Monday 26. The NEC meeting was meant to discuss union's leadership matters including the replacement of Sossion. Labour Court issued orders on Wednesday 28, stopping KNUT’s  NEC from convening a meeting to allegedly ouster Sossion. Sossion obtained the order  after he told the court that he was likely to suffer irreparable harm if the meeting was to proceed.
