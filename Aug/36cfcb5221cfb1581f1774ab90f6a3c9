Police in Kitengela on Tuesday night retrieved a gun dropped by fleeing gangsters. Peter Kiilu, a resident of an estate near Kitengela West Hospital, said, “One of them who was brandishing a gun and trying to intimidate residents realised he had no bullets and threw the weapon upstairs and ran away.” Isinya deputy county commissioner Stanley Too said although the police responded quickly to distress calls from residents, they found the gangsters gone. “The police recovered the gun and a magazine with ammunition,” Too said. The gun was being dusted for fingerprints in the course of ballistic investigations. Too also confirmed the arrest of two people in Nairobi linked to crimes in Kitengela. “They are helping the police with investigations. They are part of the gang that attacked Laetoli, Orkeju and Olerai hotels. They used trucks and cars in which they carted away property and alcoholic drinks,” he added. Each of the hotels lost cash and goods valued at between Sh500,000 and Sh700,000. Too said Kitengela had been placed under a 24-hour police surveillance.
