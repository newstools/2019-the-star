Kilifi North constituency has recorded a significant increase in the number of students joining university through government sponsorship. MP Owen Baya on Monday said this shows the constituency recorded better KCSE results compared to previous years. His office has received over 150 forms from students admitted to universities under the government programme. Last year, less than 100 students from the constituency joined university on government sponsorship. The MP praised the choice of courses by the students, saying most of them were market driven. “I have today signed forms of over 10 law students, 12 medical students; some are going for engineering, medical laboratory technology and education. So you can see the quality of degrees they are going to pursue is very important," he said. Baya said only two students were joining through self-sponsorship. The MP said his office will pay for all the students who sought fees assistance. “I have Sh2 million from the 2014-2015 financial year that my predecessor did not utilise. I approached the NG-CDF board and I was given the money. I will channel that money to make sure all these students join university,” Baya said. Baya attributed the increase in university admission to efforts by different stakeholders who were keen to see improvement. “Self-sponsored programmes are very expensive and many students have failed to complete their courses in time due to financial constraints,” he said. The office of the MP is also in talks with the Higher Education Loans Board for partnership that will ensure students from the constituency benefit fully from loans. “The Kilifi poverty index is very high, which has hindered many students from pursuing higher education. We are negotiating with HELB so that we can see more students acquire higher education," Baya said.
