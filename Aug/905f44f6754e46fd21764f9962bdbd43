Clearing and forwarding agents at Malaba border in Busia county have threatened to strike over stringent working conditions imposed by KRA. Fredrick Ochieng of Murafo Logistics said since last week they have had a rough time operating normally after Kenya Revenue Authority halted clearing of imported maize at night without a valid explanation. "We want maize to pass as usual from morning to morning with KRA and Kebs officers checking if it is fit for consumption," he said on Friday. Ochieng said that the over 50 agents would hold a demo on Monday. " We know Kenyan law allows the importation of goods 24 hours without being blocked," he said. A meeting called to resolve the stalemate collapsed on Thursday evening. The meeting ended abruptly because the KRA and Kenya Bureau of Standards officials insisted on the ban. The agents said their families depended on their job and they would lose income. "We want to tell them that they can't stop our trade," Ochieng said. Journalists who tried to get a comment from the border officials were denied entry by security officers who chased them away. Ken Papai said most border points operate 24 hours but in Malaba they close offices at 6pm. "They only want the job done during daytime. But we will not allow their laziness here. Let them be transferred," he said. Papai said President Uhuru Kenyatta wants to realise a 24-hour economy which the border officials were frustrating.
