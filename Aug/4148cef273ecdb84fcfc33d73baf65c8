A Facebook post claiming that the Taita Taveta County government has ‘sold’ the Zungulukani borehole is FALSE. The post adds that the borehole, which was drilled to serve the residents of Zungulakani, has been sold and is now being managed by the Somali pastoral community. However, Taita Taveta County Government Communications Director Dennis Onsarigo told PesaCheck that the allegations are false. According to the Taita Taveta County website, the Zungulukani water project, which was launched on October 25, 2018, is one of several boreholes that were sunk in the county to provide water to residents of Taita Taveta County. In the phone conversation, Onsarigo added that the borehole is the property of the county, and is serving everyone who resides in Zungulukani. PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the Taita Taveta County government has ‘sold’ Zungulukani borehole to the Somali pastoral community and finds it to be FALSE.
