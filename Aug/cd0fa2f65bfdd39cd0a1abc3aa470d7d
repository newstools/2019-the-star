Paul Pogba’s Manchester United team-mates are worried how he will react to be taken off penalty duties, according to The Sun. The United players were stunned by boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer announcing in the dressing room that Marcus Rashford is now the designated penalty taker following the spot-kick farce at Wolves. The French midfielder had apologised to his team-mates for the costly miss after the 1-1 draw at Molineux on Monday night. Pogba is the biggest influence in the dressing room and there are fears the public dressing down could harden his resolve to leave the club before the European transfer deadline on September 2. Pogba spurned the opportunity to claim victory for United from the penalty spot against Wolves after pulling rank over Rashford, who scored from 12-yards against Chelsea in their opening Premier League game. The decision to let Pogba take the penalty was followed by plenty of criticism and, following the game, Solskjaer vented his fury in the dressing room. Solskjaer told the United squad that Rashford is now the designated penalty taker and slammed the pair for failing to decide who was on duty before the match. The Norwegian manager was reportedly left embarrassed by the situation during the Premier League encounter. The French World Cup winner won the penalty after a strong run, which ended up with him being tripped up by centre-back Conor Coady in the area. And, after getting his way to take the ball, Pogba then saw his powerful penalty saved by Rui Patricio down to the right.  The draw has ensured the Red Devils have picked up four points from their opening two Premier League matches.
