A 45-year-old man is being held at Kilingili police station for allegedly beating his younger brother to death over a food dispute. Patrick Isimwa is alleged to have committed the offence on Monday evening in Sabatia subcounty. Vihiga county police commander Hassan Barua told the Star that Isimwa used a hammer to hit his brother. Isava chief Alex Bukiru said Isimwa had demanded food from his brother Evance Alumasa when a fistfight ensued. But Isimwa overpowered Alumasa and hit him on the head several times, the chief said. Bukiru said the two single men have been staying in that area for a while with Isimwa depending on Alumasa. Alumasaâ€™s body was taken to Mbale mortuary waiting for postmortem. Family members declined to comment on the matter as they had to go to Sabatia subcounty headquarters to record a statement.
