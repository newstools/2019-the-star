Most of the health facilities in Laikipia county are dilapidated and need urgent rehabilitation. That's what the assembly Health committee has said in a report for 2018-19 tabled on Wednesday by committee chairperson For instance, they said, Baraka Health Centre in Thingithu ward lacks a placenta pit and incinerator and thus medical waste is disposed in a compost pit or transported to Nanyuki Referral Hospital. The MCAs also indicated that most facilities are understaffed citing some in which the cleaner is also a records officer. In Matanya Health Centre in Tigithi ward some equipment donated by Ol Pejeta Conservancy is not operational as it is not compatible with the electricity connection. “Staff members don't know how to operate some machines like cryotherapy, (using freezing temperatures ) in cancer and other treatment. The facility has an unfinished building which is already cracking,” the report reads. The committee observed that Kihato Dispensary, which was constructed by a donor, does not reach immunisation targets. They said it has a dysfunctional oxygen concentrator as the staff does not know how to operate it. The facility lacks ownership documents. The road leading to Withare Dispensary in Ngobit ward from the main road is on private land and the owner intends to fence his land, the report indicates. The facility treats about 800 patients per month. “The delivery room has a substandard bed. It also needs refurbishment as it does not have piped water, soak pit or drainage system,” the report indicates. The committee said, however, that, construction of Lamuria, Doldol and Ndindika subcounty theatres was progressing well, 80 per cent complete. It recommended a raft of measures to be taken by the Health Executive including completion of stalled projects, addressing accessibility to the facilities and construction of placenta pit and incinerator.
