The Interior Designers Association of Kenya recently hosted a conference on Design for Safety at the Azuri Hotel. The principle is concerned with controlling risks as early as possible in the planning and design of buildings, structures, products, processes or systems. As well as risk or loss of life, injury or income, poor design can result in a range of other economic costs, such as low productivity, higher maintenance, higher employment and workers' compensation expenses and reduced asset life.
