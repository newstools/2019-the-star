Barely a day to the Football Kenya Federation National Super League 2019-2020 season, Coast Stima have eventually announced their nine new signings as the team prepares to clinch automatic promotion to the  Kenya Premier League. The nine will replace the eight players released by the club. Eustis Oluoch and Hawkins Ademba have been drafted in to bolster the defensive department that was a big let down last season and following the departure of experienced captain  Omar Sharif. In midfield, Dominic Mwangi, Austine Wahongo and Alphonce Washi will rejuvenate an already solid department as Stima's philosophy of the ball feeling every blade of grass perfectly suits them. Fredrick Okello, Clinton Aura and Gor's loanee Eric Ombija will add firepower up front. They face competition from seasoned Boniface Akenga who is back to full fitness after a season plagued with injuries. Goalkeeper Ryan Musa is also in their books. With an almost new-look team, team manager Kenneth Juma believes anything short of the automatic promotion will be a failure and backed the new players to settle quickly and hit the ground running. "Our ambitions are clear. We want to finish in the first two positions to avoid plays offs. With the squad we have, we can achieve our top-flight status having finished eighth last season. With a fully fit Akenga and the talent of Ombija, our worrisome attack can give opposition defenders nightmares," he said. "We have had a thorough preseason and despite losing against Bandari and Modern Coast, there were a lot of positives and the team can only become better. We have rectified on set-piece defending and our ball movement is now a notch higher. New signings are already feeling at home and fired up to showcase their skills," observed Juma Stima will welcome Fortune Sacco tomorrow at Mbaraki grounds, Mombasa and will hope for a flying start.
