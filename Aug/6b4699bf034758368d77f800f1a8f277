National women’s sitting volleyball coach Benard Musumba believes the team has what it takes to book the sole slot to Rio Olympics as they open their title campaign against hosts Rwanda in the Africa Paralympics-cum- qualifiers on September 15. The event which will be played on the round-robin format will then see Kenya square it out with Egypt and Zimbabwe in their subsequent matches. Musumba said the training is going on well and they can only hope for the best ahead of the event. “The players are in the right form of mind and are raring to go. We have been on non-residential training at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani for a while now and the players are improving as the day’s progress.  We have a formidable provisional squad and it will be interesting to see who will make the final cut of 12 players,” said the former International. In the men’s category, Kenya coached by Julius Ouma is drawn in pool “A” alongside hosts Rwanda and Morocco. Kenya will play their first match against hosts  on September 19 before they wrap up  the group with a tie against Morocco next day. Pool “B” features  Egypt, Algeria and South Africa. Kenya Sitting Volleyball Federation chairman Polycarp Mboya noted the men’s pool is tricky but remained hopeful the team will give their opponents a run for their money. “It’s an interesting line-up but we are preparing well for the championship. But we will be out to book a semi-final slot and see what happens from there,” said Mboya who also double up as a player. Mboya at the same time lauded Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko for availing a bus that picks and drops players from the training at a central place in town saying it has eased players travelling hustle.
