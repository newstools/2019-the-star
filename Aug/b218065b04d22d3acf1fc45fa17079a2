The wife of missing Dutch tycoon Tob Cohen was arraigned at a Kiambu court on Thursday over links to her estranged husband's disappearance. The DCI is seeking 14 more days to complete investigations. A determination on whether the extra days shall be granted will be made on Monday. Wairimu will be detained at Muthaiga police station until then. Last month, the former Philips Electronics East Africa chairman Cohen had complained of harassment and denial of his conjugal rights by his estranged wife. Cohen, 71, was reported missing on July 19 but Directorate of Criminal Investigation detectives are yet to locate him and determine whether is dead or alive. His phone has been off since he went missing. A source at the Immigration Department said they had combed through all passenger manifestos for outbound flights for possible dates but Cohen's name was not in any. The senior official said Cohen was still in the country as there was no evidence indicating that he had left through any of the official exit points. Wairimu had allegedly told police at the Spring Valley Station that Cohen had travelled to Thailand for urgent medical attention.
