A man was speared to death during a fierce fight between herders and farmers in Safirisi village, Lamu West, on Sunday evening. Joseph Mutwiri Mbugua, 22, was killed when he tried to stop a group herders from grazing their livestock on his farm. Mbugua died instantly after he was speared on the left side of his chest. The herders, the majority of whom are from neighbouring Tana River and Garissa counties, have been accused of deliberately grazing their animals on people’s farms. Mary Kariuki, who witnessed the incident, said “He died trying to defend what he owns. They killed him and left him there. It’s so unfair." Julius Mwangi, the chairperson of the Hind Ward Farmers Association, urged the government to intervene and resolve disputes between farmers and herders in the region. Farmers and herders in the region are embroiled in a bitter feud over grazing pastures. The situation is worse in areas such as Kakathe, Maleli, Chalaluma, Sina Mbio, Lake Amu and Hindi in Lamu West. Numerous meetings to resolve the matter have not been successful. “We take part in peace meetings but once we leave, no one does what we agreed on, especially the herders. Whenever there are differences, they don’t negotiate, they just attack and kill people,” Mwangi said. Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia confirmed the killing and said investigations are underway. “There must be sanity, respect and harmony between the farmers and herders. We’ll be holding livestock owners responsible in any case their employees cause problems,” Macharia said. The killing comes three weeks after a farmer was attacked and wounded by herders in Kakathe, Witu, Lamu West. Sistine Mwashuma was seriously injured after she was stabbed with a spear as she tried to bar the herders from grazing on her farm.
