There are gaps in governance instruments of the National Council of Churches of Kenya,  general secretary Peter Karanja said on Thursday. However, the gaps will be addressed at an appropriate time, Karanja told reporters at Jumuiya Conference and Country Home in Limuru. He disclosed that members of the executive committee had forgiven each other over pre-meeting differences. The differences arose after the appointment of the Rev Chris Kinyanjui as his successor. “So many issues came up and we agreed to call a meeting to address them. However, some will be addressed at an appropriate time” he said. Journalists were locked out of the deliberations. Karanja affirmed that the delegates had agreed to embrace a culture of listening and understanding each other. "We conclude by calling to mind the importance of embracing a culture of listening in every situation. Listening to one another is the foundation of understanding and reconciliation in the society," the GS said. The issues raised will be addressed after Kinyanjui assumes office on October 1. The GS was accompanied by national executive committee members ACK archbishop Jackson ole Sapit and PCEA moderator Julius Mwamba who signed a statement on behalf of chairman Timothy Ndambuki, who was away with apologies. Some of the issues raised were NCCK's multimillion-shilling assets and claims that Karanja had influenced the election of his successor on June 18. Karanja said the election was conducted as per NCCK by-laws. Some of the NCCK owned properties include Jumuia hotels in Mombasa, Nakuru, Limuru and Kisumu, and Tumaini House in Nairobi’s Central Business District. It also makes daily income from the Jumuia hospitals in Kakamega, Kaimosi and Huruma.
