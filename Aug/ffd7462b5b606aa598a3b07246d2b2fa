Police officers have arrested a 32-year-old man for pretending to be a National Intelligence Service officer. Ambrose Nesta Makokha impersonated an NIS officer at Industrial Area Police Station on Tuesday seeking to interrogate a prisoner. He was seeking  OCS permission to see the prisoner detained at Industrial Area, but produced fake NIS ID. The fake ID was confiscated. The man is in police custody waiting to be arraigned on Wednesday. The arrest comes barely a week after a police officer was arraigned in court for being connected to robbery. The officer denied the charges, saying that he never used his gun to rob residents but tried to help them, he said. Moses Musungu was implicated in a robbery with violence incident but said he was at the scene of crime to help.
