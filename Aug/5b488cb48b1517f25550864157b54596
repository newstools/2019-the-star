Siaya county government will revive the dairy sector for Sh7 million after it stalled due to debt. The Sam-Malanga Dairy Cooperative collapsed in 2016 after it failed to clear bills of more than Sh4million. But in the spirit of the Big Four agenda, Governor Cornel Rasanga has pledged to implement President Uhuru Kenyatta’s four pillars by revamping local industries. Rasanga on Tuesday asked the head of the industrialisation department to ensure the funds are injected in the Dairy Cooperative Society in form of a loan. “I will visit the  plant whose revival has been mooted as part of the ongoing plans by my government to jump-start the region’s economy,” Rasanga said. The governor said the funds will be given as a loan that would be repaid by the management of the dairy society. Rasanga  directed the dairy’s board to clear the pending bills especially the Sh.3.9 million debts owed to the suppliers of milk since 2016 to 2018.
