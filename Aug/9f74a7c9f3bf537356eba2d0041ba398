 Mandera Governor Ali Roba has urged census officials to conduct a proper enumeration of residents to avoid contestation of results. Northeastern Kenya counties of Mandera, Wajir and Garissa disputed the 2009 census figures saying they were doctored. They said the region had more residents that was was captured. Census results are key, especially for counties, because they determine revenue allocation. Speaking to reporters in his office on Thursday, Roba asked the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics and the Planning department to keenly monitor the process for accuracy. “I want to appeal to the management of KNBS to closely monitor the time taken to enumerate each household and ensure all residents are covered,” Roba said. He urged residents to cooperate with enumerators. The governor was among those counted on Saturday. He said time allocated for listing each household was not enough. Roba appealed to pastoralists who have moved with their livestock in search of pasture to return for the enumeration before the August 31 deadline. Mandera deputy county commissioner Solomon Cheboton urged residents to ensure they are counted. He said security had been strengthened for both residents and officials conducting the census. There were fears that al Shabaab militants who have remained active in parts of the region, especially near border tows, were planning to disrupt the national exercise. There have, however, been no incidents so far. On Wednesday, Wajir leaders expressed concern, saying not all residents could be counted. They cited few enumerators and poor transport planning for the officials. They asked the national government and KNBS to urgently address the problems.  edited by peter obuya
