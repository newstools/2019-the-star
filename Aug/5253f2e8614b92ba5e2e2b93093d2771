Jadon Sancho has sealed a jackpot £190,000-a-week pay deal at Borussia Dortmund. The England forward, 19, has been rewarded with an improved long-term contract that sees his salary soar to just under £10million a year. It was offered to him after he turned down interest from Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain to stay with last season’s Bundesliga runners-up. Last week, Sancho was rated the fifth most valuable player on the planet, at £145m, in a report by the CIES Football Observatory. His status as one of the hottest prospects in world football has now been acknowledged by Dortmund, who have handed the teenager a lucrative extension to his previous deal, which was due to run until 2022 and was worth around £75,000 per week. Sancho scored 13 goals and made 15 assists for Dortmund last season, earning him a breakthrough into the England senior set-up as he emerged as one of Europe’s most influential attackers. Sancho’s suitors will now have to break the bank on wages as well as a transfer fee to lure him away next summer. Dortmund were bracing themselves for a battle to hang on to Sancho next summer, but they are now hopeful they can retain him a while longer following his decision to commit to the club. Sancho quit Manchester City in August 2017 in order to join Dortmund and further his career. City and Manchester United are expected to be in the group of Europe’s biggest clubs who will test Dortmund’s resolve to hang on to Sancho.
