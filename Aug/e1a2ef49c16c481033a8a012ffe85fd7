Mwenda decried of slow start in the match that was played at TGT Kisongo and said the players would have to rise up to the occasion in the match against Dagoretti. “Its unfortunate we didn’t settle early in the match unlike our opponents and by time we were getting comfortable the game was already in Kakamega’ favour and therefore they will have to regroup and put the right foot forward in our next match.” said the coach. Mwenda said they are targeting a podium finish at the annual event. His opposite number Amos Wamanga said the win was given but was quick to note they will be going for the title that has remained elusive since 2016.
