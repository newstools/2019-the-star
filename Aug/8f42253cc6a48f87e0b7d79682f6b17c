Five months ago, Baby Jeremy came into the world as a premature baby having been born only at 25 weeks at Kenyatta National Hospital. On Tuesday, Baby Jeremy who at birth weighed 400gms — the weight of a loaf of bread — was ready to be discharged at 3.5kgs. This outcome is not only phenomenal for the country and the region but a great boost to the morale of Kenyan medics. KNH has many times been in the news for the wrong reasons but this feat should be celebrated by all Kenyans. As we hope to see Baby Jeremy grow into a healthy toddler, teen and adult, we congratulate the KNH staff who made this possible. This is a moment to reflect on KNH as the country's largest referral hospital that again is overcoming challenges and demonstrating that Kenyans can get world-class healthcare. It's time for the Nairobi and National government to ensure congestion at the hospital is a thing of the past. KNH management has called on the government to ensure that health facilities outside the capital are well equipped and staffed. It is time to ensure that KNH continues to produce not only miracles but also consistently excellent care for all.
