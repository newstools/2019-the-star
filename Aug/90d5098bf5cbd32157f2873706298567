Jurgen Klopp is unhappy that Liverpool have been asked to kick off the new Premier League this week ahead of their rivals. Liverpool open the 2019/20 league campaign against Norwich on Friday night despite being the last English team in competitive action last season when they faced Tottenham in the Champions League final on July 1. “I would prefer to have played the game against Norwich on Sunday, two more days,” said Klopp. “We had the last game (Champions League final) and the first Premier League game. It doesn’t sound like it’s exactly like it should be.” “I see people are excited and looking forward to it but no one worries about the problems. That’s why I have to mention them because no one else sees it. Our last game against Spurs was three weeks after everybody played their last game and now we have the first game. Who can have this idea? As European champions, Liverpool could play a potential 67 matches this season in seven different competitions. This summer, they have played pre-season friendlies in America, Scotland and Switzerland and meet Manchester City in the Community Shield at Wembley yesterday. Star names like Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane also represented their countries in summer tournaments and Mane has yet to play for Liverpool after Senegal reached the final of the African Cup of Nations. He will be excused this afternoon ‘s clash against City leaving Klopp with a dilemna whether to throw him straight in on Friday night. The rest of the Premier League fixtures take place next weekend.
