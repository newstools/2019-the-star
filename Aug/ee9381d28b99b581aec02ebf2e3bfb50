Businessman Humphrey Kariuki was on Monday rearrested after being freed on bail. He was arrested for being in possession of ethanol. Kariuki will take a plea over the matter on Tuesday. He had earlier been granted Sh11 million bail with an alternative bond of Sh22 million over tax evasion charges. Presiding magistrate Magistrate Francis Andayi in his ruling had said that it would be discriminatory to detain Kariuki. He, however, directed that the businessman appear before the DCI within six hours after he meets the bail and bond terms. The tycoon is facing several counts including forgery, money laundering, tax evasion among others. Kariuki denied all the charges from three files. His case will be mentioned on SeptemberÂ  5.
