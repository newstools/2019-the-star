Athletics Kenya will be taking the war on doping to the doorsteps of athletes in Elgeyo Marakwet County tomorrow. The meeting at Iten Sports Ground will bring together athletes, coaches, sub-agents and managers in a partnership between the federation, Elgeyo Marakwet County and the national government as the battle against the vice intensifies. Christened the home of champions due to the budding athletes, the officials will be charting the way forward in fighting doping with Kenya under siege. North Rift Athletics Kenya Public Relations officer Boniface Tiren, said: “We want to pass a clear message to the public, especially athletes that as officials, we are doing our part on sensitising them so they have to remain on toes to remain clean." He added that doping has affected the country and winning in any championships is not a walk in the park due to doubts raised upon the winner even if he is she is clean. “We are fighting a big elephant in athletics. We want to raise the standards of running and engage our young people to stay away to issues that can lead to violation of anti-doping rules. Apart from receiving bans, taking banned substances is also a health hazard that ruins someone’s future,” added Tiren. This will be the second time they are hosting the anti-doping crusade in the county that has produced top athletes including four-time New York City Marathon champion Mary Keitany, former world record holders Wilson Kipsang and Dennis Kimetto and is also home to reigning world half marathon champion Joyciline Jepkosgei among others.
