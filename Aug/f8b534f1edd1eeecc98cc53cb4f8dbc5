Everton defender Yerry Mina believes he is playing his best football since he arrived at the club. The Colombia international has started the season alongside Michael Keane in the centre of defence and the pair have yet to concede a goal ­— the only top-flight side to do so after two matches. That makes it six successive personal clean sheets for Mina as Colombia did not concede during this summer’s Copa America, where they lost their quarter-final on penalties after a goalless draw with Chile. But the 6ft 4ins centre-back, a £27million signing 12 months ago, admits he still has much to learn about the Premier League and his partnership with Keane will be key. All of Mina’s five Everton clean sheets, three of which have been in his last four appearances dating back to March, have come when starting alongside the former Burnley player in a back four. “I feel very good, the manager (Marco Silva) is working with me every day and giving me a lot of confidence,” said Mina, who has not started more than six successive matches because of injury problems. “I am understanding more what he wants all the time and becoming more comfortable. This is my best football since I came to Everton but I have to keep my focus and always work to improve.” “It is the main job of the goalkeeper and centre-backs to keep clean sheets - that is what we are working to achieve every day. But we know there is still much to improve.”
