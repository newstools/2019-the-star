Fishermen at Lake Turkana have been warned of catching undersized fish. Turkana executive for Agriculture and Fisheries Christopher Aletia said on Tuesday that officers are monitoring fishing. "They are educating fish management units and the community that if anyone is found catching undersize fish he will be arrested," he said. Lodwar fish dealer urged county officials to warn fishermen not to catch small fish. They said there is a surplus of undersized fish at Lodwar market, which is threatening the economy. Lucy Otieno, a fish dealer in Lodwar town, said, "We are getting fish that we didn’t order and we have no option but to sell to our customers. The county should take enforcement measures." Fish dealer Robert Ekeno said that since the school was closed for the August holiday, children near the lake are fishing and catching small fish. “We depend on the fish business for income so we can pay bills and take children to school if the problem of undersized fish is not managed, we won't have fish in the lake or the market," Ekeno said. In July schoolchildren around Lake Turkana were reported skipping classes to make money by fishing. Peter Lotiang, senior assistant chief of Namukuse in Kalokol, expressed alarm over the number of children chucking books for fishing nets. He said  boys and girlsare trying to earn money to buy watches, smartphones, clothes, money for upkeep and cash to watch videos in centres “I have been urging parents to take their children to school," he said. "But because of negligence boys and girls are still flocking to the lake to trap and wash fish for a fee," he told the Star. (Edited by V. Graham)
