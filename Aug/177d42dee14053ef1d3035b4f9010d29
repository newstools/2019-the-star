Thangatha Dam in Tigania East, Meru has dried up because of persistent drought. Speaking during a crisis meeting at the dry Thangatha Dam on Thursday, Meru county executive Eunice Kobia urged residents to prepare for the worst as the drought persists in some parts of the county. Several rivers have also dried up. The Sh39 million dam expected to supply water to about 150,000 was launched by Deputy President William Ruto in August 2018. Kobia said residents who depend on water from Michimikuru, Akaiga Giant, Kiguchwa, Thangatha and Imetha water projects must store water due to rationing starting Monday next week. “People must buy big tanks to secure and store safe water for domestic use. I urge Meru people to be sensitive on how they utilise water,” she said. Kobia cautioned residents against leaving running water in their homes so that people downstream can have access to the vital resource. She said it is a collective responsibility for every individual to reclaim the catchment areas and plant trees to rehabilitate riparian areas. Kobia asked residents affected by the drying of the dam to be patient. “The essence of this dam is to have a common intake for easier regulations,” she said. Joseph Mber, the Meru urban water corporation CEO, said rationing will be the only solution until it rains.
