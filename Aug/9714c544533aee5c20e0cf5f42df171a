Newbies Dagoretti High basketball coach Peter Orero was on cloud nine after his side defied odds to reach the final of the East Africa Secondary School Games at the St. Constantine International School in Arusha, Tanzania. The Nairobi region defeated Rwanda LDK 56-42 to storm into the finals where they will cross swords with Buddo of Uganda, who beat seven-time champions Laiser Hill Academy 60-49 in the second semi-final. Orero said: “We have nothing to lose at this stage. Making it to the final in our first appearance is a milestone and I am super proud of the boys. Whatever happens tomorrow (today) is a formality because these boys are already winners.” Dagoretti will look for revenge against Buddo, who beat them in the preliminary rounds. Laiser will now play LDK for the bronze medal today.
