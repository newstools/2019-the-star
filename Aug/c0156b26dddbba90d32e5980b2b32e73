A 65-year-old man committed suicide on Thursday evening at Kwa Mwaura village in Laikipia East subcounty after he was allegedly diagnosed with cancer. Confirming the incident on Friday, Laikipia county police commander Maxwell Nyaema said Tabathia Mugambi hanged himself in his house. “He left behind a suicide note that was found in his house about 200 meters from Kalalu trading centre. It stated that he did it on his own and his wife Teresia Kabariti Nyokabi should not be asked anything,” Nyaema said. The police boss noted that Charles Maina, a nephew, reported to police officers that his uncle committed suicide by hanging himself in the house. Nyaema said the officers found the body hanging from a rope inside the house. It was not immediately established what type of cancer he was diagnosed with and at what stage. The body was taken to Nanyuki Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary awaiting postmortem. The incident occurs at a time when the killer disease has continued consuming the lives of many people in the country. Edited by R.Wamochie
