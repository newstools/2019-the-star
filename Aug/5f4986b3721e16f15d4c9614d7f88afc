The National Treasury has issued a public statement to the public confirming the disbursement of Sh314 billion to the 47 county governments. The Treasury said the amount allocated was the equitable share of the raised revenue nationally. Treasury said the amount allocated for the financial year 2018/2019 represents 100 per cent of the appropriation in accordance with the County Allocation Revenue Act, 2018. Counties also received Sh46.1 billion in addition to the equitable share, which comprises of allocations worth more than Sh15 billion derived from the National Government. Counties also received Sh7.4 billion from the Roads Maintenance Levy Fund which was collected by the Kenya Roads Board. Aggregated payments to counties for the financial year 2018/19Â  amounted to Sh360.1 billion, which represents 96 per cent of the CARA. "The shortfall arose due to failure by come counties to adhere to requirements of specific conditional allocation. The exchequer could not disburse Sh1.04 billion for the development of youth polytechnics and Sh605 million for construction of county headquarters," the statement by Treasury PS Julius Muia read. The Treasury, however, did not disburse Sh844.9 million from Road Maintenance Levy Fund because six counties failed to comply with KRB ACT. The National Treasury also said accounting officers of some ministries failed to submit written instructions to the Treasury to release funds. "County governments have so far received Sh1.7 trillion cumulatively since they were established," Muia said. Treasury also said that county governments equitable revenue share have been above the minimum threshold and have been fully disbursed in accordance with the Division of Revenue Act.
