A young man was yesterday charged with assaulting a delivery boy over payment. Amos Mogire is said to have beaten Simon Wekesa, a 15-year-old boy who had been sent to deliver a phone battery worth Sh600. Wekesa said Mogire insisted that he should take Sh50, not Sh600, and when he declined, the accused turned violent. Court papers showed Mogire assaulted the complainant on July 9, 2019 in Riruta. Wekesa had been sent by a friend to deliver the battery to Mogire and return with the money. He went to Mogire's house and was given Sh50.  He refused and decided to return the battery to the owner. The accused entered his house and returned with a knife. The complainant calmed him down and moved away, but Mogire followed him and threatened to stab him. He fell and the accused hit him with a stone on the head. “I stood and followed the accused home where I met his father and told him what had transpired. He promised to talk to his son,” Wekesa said. His condition deteriorated. “I woke up at Kenyatta National Hospital. I stayed there for a month after having undergone head surgery,” he said. The complainant reported the assault after he was discharged. Mogire was arrested and charged. Yesterday he appeared before chief magistrate Joyce Gandani and pleaded to be released on lenient bond as "I am only 17 years old". The magistrate granted him a Sh30,000 bond with a similar surety or a Sh10,000 bail. In the meantime, his age will be determined at Kamiti Prison's children department. The hearing will be heard on November 14.
