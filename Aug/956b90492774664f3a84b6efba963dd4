Harambee Starlets have their work cut out to reach the next round of the CAF Women’s 2020 Tokyo Olympic qualifiers after they fell to a 3-2 defeat away to Malawi’s ‘She Flames’ yesterday. It was a ‘sisters act’ that did the Kenyan girls in in Blantyre as first, Towera Vunkumba squeezed the ball past Kenyan goalkeeper Annette Kwamasi following a cross from her sister Salome Vunkumba. Cynthia Shilatswo drew Kenya level with a stupendous free-kick 10 minutes to the break but Malawi retook the lead just soon afterwards when Temwa Chawinga, who plays in Sweden danced past three Starlets’ defenders allowing her elder sister China-based Tabitha Chawinga the easy task of side-footing the ball past Kwamasi. A controversial penalty kick on the cusp of halftime was scored by Tabitha to give the hosts a two-goal cushion going into the second half. The ‘She Flames’ came back into the second half intently but a combination of poor finishing and top draw saves from Kwamasi kept them from adding onto their solid lead. When all seemed lost, lady luck smiled on the Kenyans as a clearance from Patricia Nyirenda came off her teammate Salome and flew above the head of goalkeeper Samir Amidu in the 81st minute to give Starlets hope going into the second leg on Sunday. The return leg is set to be played behind closed doors, at the Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos. This is following the unavailability of the Moi Stadium, Kasarani, the only venue approved by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) for international venues. Should Kenya pass the Malawi test, they will be up against the winner of yet another second-round tie pitting Gabon against Ghana.
