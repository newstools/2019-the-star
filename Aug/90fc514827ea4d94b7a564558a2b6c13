Nemanja Matic is set to sit down with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for clear-the-air talks as he looks to get some clarity on his future at Manchester United. The 31-year-old is yet to play any minutes in the Premier League season, with Solskjaer leaning on Scott McTominay when it comes to defensive duties in midfield. Matic is now demanding showdown talks with his Norwegian boss after losing his place in United’s starting XI. It has been clear that Solskjaer is putting a strong emphasis on promoting youth going forward at United, with the club waving goodbye to both Marouane Fellaini and Ander Herrera in the space of six months. The writing may be on the wall for the Serbian who was a firm favourite under Solskjaer’s predecessor, Jose Mourinho. Mourinho brought Matic in from Chelsea in a £40million deal back in 2017, after the pair enjoyed plenty of success at Stamford Bridge. However, Matic has not started under Solskjaer since the first week of May last season when United were beaten Huddersfield, who were relegated to the Championship shortly thereafter. Should Solskjaer and Matic not see eye-to-eye over his future, United may be forced to sell the midfielder before September 2 as a number of clubs are reportedly monitoring his situation at Old Trafford. Meanwhile, United fear Luke Shaw could be out for five weeks with a hamstring injury. The 24-year-old pulled up during the first half of Saturday’s defeat to Crystal Palace and was replaced by Ashley Young. Scans have since confirmed he is facing at least a month on the sidelines ruling him out of Premier League games against former club Southampton, Leicester City, West Ham and Arsenal. The news comes as a blow to Solskjaer as he looks to get his side back on track at Southampton this weekend following an indifferent start to the season.
