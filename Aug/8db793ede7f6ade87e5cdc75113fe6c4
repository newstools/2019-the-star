The Education Ministry has opposed a proposal that seeks to have schools conduct holiday tuition. It is a proposal whose origin is an amendment to the Basic Education Act 2013. The law that governs the management of primary and secondary schools in the country. Appearing before parliament on Thursday, Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang said the ministry does not support the regulations as it undermines the need for children to rest. Parliament sought the ministryâ€™s input on the proposals. The bill is sponsored by Murang'a Women Representative Sabina Chege, and is currently under the Education committee. The committee will on Saturday retreat in Mombasa where they will deliberate on the content of the bill. "The proposal contravenes section 37 of the Basic Education Act 2013. We should let children be children and that holiday is important for their development,"Kipsang said. The proposal seeks to amend the Basic Education Act, the law that governs operations in primary and secondary schools. If passed, schools will be required to enter into a written agreement with parents before conducting the tuition, a move that could see the return of embattled holiday tuition. However, the proposal stipulates that tuition will only be intended to help children with learning difficulties by providing extra coaching to enable them to catch up in the curriculum. But the proposal further incorporates a different twist, suggesting that a child could decide to engage in tuition to better their co-curricular skills.
