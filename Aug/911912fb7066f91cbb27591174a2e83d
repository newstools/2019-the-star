Despite widespread allegations of our national carrier Kenya Airways making losses, the airline’s management appears unmoved. When it was rated among profit-making airlines, it used to advertise discounted fares to attract travellers. Now, a big jet can take off with two-thirds of the seats empty. Wouldn’t it make more economic sense to slash fares by a third and have all the seats occupied thus enabling the airline to earn more revenue on the flight? Furthermore, the airline should introduce discounted fares for local flights. Mombasa
