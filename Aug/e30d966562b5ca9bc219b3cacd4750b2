Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa has declared he will challenge Sirisia MP John Waluke as Bungoma chairman in Jubilee party polls. The ruling party is set to hold its grassroots polls in March next year. "I hereby tender my candidature for the Bungoma county Jubilee Party chairperson position," said Barasa. Barasa spoke to the press on Thursday in his office in Kimilili town. He said he wants to bring a new dawn in Jubilee in Bungoma ahead of the 2022 polls. The MP said Waluke had failed to rejuvenate the party in the county's nine constituencies. "I'm not happy with matters that pertain to the leadership of our Jubilee Party in Bungoma county," he said. Waluke was ODM Bungoma party chairman before he ditched the party for Jubilee ahead of the 2017 polls. Barasa said party members want to elect leaders who will help the party retain the presidency come 2022. "I have written a notification letter to the Jubilee secretariat and given them my programs aimed at consolidating support from all and sundry, variance in political parties notwithstanding," he said.
