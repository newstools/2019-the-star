First Lady Margaret Kenyatta was on Tuesday named 'a daughter of Tana River’ following her heartfelt love for the once marginalised county. She is now called ‘Dhiramo Kenyatta’, which refers to a girl born during the drought season in the Pokomo community. Tana River Governor Dhadho Godhana gave her the name after she was dressed in the traditional Pokomo regalia by top county government officials, including Health executive Mwanajuma Hiribae. The initiation and naming ‘ceremony’ took place at the Hola Referral Hospital, when the First Lady opened a 60-bed maternal and neonatal unit. It started with a brief ceremony that had been planned by the county to dress the First Lady in traditional regalia. After Mwanajuma’s speech, she announced that they had instructions to officially welcome Margaret as one of their own for her love of Tana River people. In 2016, the First Lady was at Hola Referral Hospital to lay the foundation of the maternity wing, and three years later, she came to launch it. For the people of Tana River, it’s a special honour for the First Lady to visit them twice. More so on important issue of addressing maternal health in the county, which is among those marginalised for many years since Independence. Margaret also donated a container with equipment worth Sh40 million, which included medical equipment, lab facilities, ultrasound machines and diagnostic equipment, which will boost patient safety and ensure patients get treatment easily.
