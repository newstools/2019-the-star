Budalang'i constituency will meet the population threshold and avoid being merged with another after the census, former MP Ababu Namwamba said on Saturday. The constituency is among 27 electoral units that risk being merged if they fail to raise the 133,138 minimum population required. But Ababu told residents he was confident the constituency will have enough numbers at the end of the ongoing census. “I want to assure residents of Budalang'i that the constituency will not be scrapped or merged with another because even those living outside the area will be counted and included in the constituency population data at the end of the exercise,”Ababu said. The Foreign Affairs Chief Administrative Secretary was speaking at St Benedict Budalang'i High School during the wedding of Busia Nominated MCA Bernard Odako. Ababu urged residents to turn up in large numbers for the national count for accurate data to help in government planning.  edited by peter obuya
