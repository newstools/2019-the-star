At least two coffee brands have been developed in Kericho county to help upcoming farmers make a profit. Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony, through his Agriculture executive Philip Mason, donated coffee pulping machines worth Sh7 million. Pulping machines convert raw coffee berries into beans to be dried. With the establishment of a coffee auction in Kipkelion, Kipkelion West, the coffee farmers will be able to freely auction Zawadi and Champion coffee brands without going to Mombasa where cartels were exploiting them. Unlike sugarcane, tea and dairy farming that made an impact in Kericho county, coffee farming was rarely known. Coffee farming is mainly done in Kipkelion West, Sigowet-Soin and parts of Ainamoi subcounties. Farmers there will benefit from the pulping machines. While donating the machines, the governor told representatives of coffee co-operative societies that 120,000 coffee seedlings will be distributed to farmers. Kipkelion Coffee MillsÂ  at Fort-Ternan town is already processing Zawadi and Champion coffee brands after acquiring modern roasting machines. Governor Chepkwony says the county, which has vast uncultivated land, may soon excel inn high-quality coffee production. Edited by R.Wamochie
