Too much miraa chewing has been blamed for dysfunctional marriages in Lamu county. The preferred variety in the region is muguka. Women say that men who consume miraa are difficult to engage with. This has resulted in increased divorces and family break-ups. Halima Kupi, a mother of six, says she single-handedly fends for herself as her husband, a mangrove trader, spends all his money on miraa. “Women like me have been left on their own to fend for the families. Our men have diverted all earnings to miraa. A man would rather chew miraa and sleep hungry than take care of his responsibilities,” Kupi said. The men are equally failures in bed. “Men leave home at 2pm and return past midnight, barely do anything. Women are suffering. That’s why there are many extra-marital affairs by those who aren’t patient,” Kupi said. Lamu Council of Elders chairperson Sharif Salim said men waste time chewing the herb in hangout joints. “Many families are dysfunctional. Men buy miraa but not food or medication for their children. They would rather be holed up with friends chewing than at home with their wives and children,” Salim said. His deputy, Abubakar Shelali, said they have received several complaints from women that they are being denied conjugal rights. “It’s not just embarrassing but also dangerous for a man to become so enslaved to a habit to an extent of not functioning in any capacity,” Shelali said. The elders want a special rehab facility established for miraa addicts. However, some residents blame consumers, not miraa. Peter Muriungi, a miraa seller and consumer, says “miraa is a source of livelihood for many unemployed people. Miraa is innocent," he said.
