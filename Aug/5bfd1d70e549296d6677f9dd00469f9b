Illiteracy stands at 67 per cent in West Pokot county where cattle rustling is a way of life and school is scorned. Parents have been urged to  take their children to school to give them a better future. Speaking at Siyoi after meeting students who are to join university next month, Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto said joint efforts are needed to bring down the illiteracy rate. “We have the Constituency Development Fund, the county bursary fund and the national government is also giving grants to help the children further their studies,” he said. The lawmaker urged the students to further their studies and be role models. Concentrate on education and help to transform the narrative of this county, he said. "We have been known for cattle rustling but now it’s our time to prove to the world that we are book rustlers,” he said. The MP condemned the late release of funds from the government and urged the Ministry of Education to ensure they are released on time. “Releasing the funds on time will avoid affecting school calendar." Moroto also raised concern over an increase of social joints in Makutano town, saying students are indulging in drugs. “Bars have been opened all over town, some even near churches and this has barred many students from focusing on education since they spend most of the time there,” he said. Moroto called on the county security team to investigate if they are operating legally. Edited by R.Wamochie
