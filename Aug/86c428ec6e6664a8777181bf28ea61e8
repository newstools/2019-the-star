Bishop Sulumeti Secondary volleyball star Madina Okot has switched the western Kenya school for coast's Kaya Tiwi to try her hand in basketball. The lanky player featured for  Western Region champions during the national  Kenya  Secondary  School  Sports Association that was held in Kisumu early this month and it was there that she caught the eyes of Tiwi principal Robert Avan. Avan later talked to the player for a possible switch to the school and the discipline altogether before he engaged her parents a move they agreed. Okot joined the coastal side during the just ended East Africa School Games in Arusha, Tanzania although she was not a part of the team that won bronze medal ahead of national champions Buru Buru who settled for the fourth position. “We saw the player and went for her. She has an amazing height which any basketball coach will go for and we took the chance before other schools took note of her and I’m glad she accepted our offer,” noted Avan . He added: “She is in form one and therefore she has a long way to go. Gladly at this stage, she has not come of age in her previous sport and therefore we will easily mould her to be a basketball player and not just any other player but a good one at that.” Avan noted the school has given the student full scholarship and will support her going forward. “One thing with our school is that we always link players who have performed well not only in the sport but also in the studies with clubs in the United States which is a plus. Four players will clear school later this year and I’m happy we have replacements as our intention is to reclaim both the national and regional titles come next year,” observed the principal.
