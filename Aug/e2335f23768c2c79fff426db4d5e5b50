Zurich will host the 2020 and 2021 Diamond League finals under the new one-final format that was jointly announced by the IAAF and Diamond League in March this year. The Diamond League was established in 2010 with two finals, traditionally held in Zurich and Brussels, but for the next two years Zurich, long considered one of the pre-eminent one-day meetings in the world, will host the single final. The selection of the final venue was also influenced by the scheduled renovation of the King Baudoin Stadium in Brussels over the next two years. The history of the Zurich meeting goes back to 1928 when Paavo Nurmi was the star of the first international meeting held at the Letzigrund Stadium. Weltklasse Zurich, which was recognised with an IAAF Heritage Plaque this year, has been setting standards for athletics ever since and the Diamond League board is confident that it will produce a fitting climax to the 2020 and 2021 one-day seasons. “Zurich has been the home of many of the most extraordinary moments in athletics over more than 90 years, including 25 world records, and we are delighted that it will host the pinnacle one-day meeting of 2020,’’ says IAAF President Sebastian Coe. The Diamond League is vital to our future growth as it provides an annual showcase of the very best in athletics, which is why we must ensure that every contest broadcast to the world is of the highest standard. We expect the new Diamond League format to be even more thrilling for our global audience as it builds excitement throughout the outdoor season and reaches a crescendo in Zurich.” The Diamond League finals will feature a 150-minute international broadcast, an hour longer than the regular season meetings, which will move to a 90-minute international broadcast, featuring a tailored programme of disc
