A civil society group in Kisumu has asked Governor Anyang Nyong’o to dismiss impeached finance executive Nerry Achar. The executive director of Transform Empowerment for Action Initiative George Owuor said the governor should kick out the CEC as recommended by the county assembly. "It's unfortunate that weeks after the assembly impeached finance CEC Nerry Achar,  he is still in office and the governor has not taken any action," he said on Friday. The group gave Nyong'o a seven days ultimatum to appoint a new finance executive. The group further noted that Nyong’o should know he holds his position in trust for the people and must listen to representatives of the people, the MCAs. Owuor asked speaker Onyango Oloo to ensure an impeachment motion against the governor is drafted should he fail to adhere to the recommendations of the assembly. Owuor revisited the demolition of structures, noting that the economy of Kisumu will take long to recover. He said many small traders now live in poverty after their livelihoods were destroyed. Owour asked the county government to provide the list of traders who are set to benefit from the stalls being constructed for accountability.
