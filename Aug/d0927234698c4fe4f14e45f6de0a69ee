City Hall on Thursday started the crackdown on building owners who have not repainted their properties as required after every two years. More than 10 people were arrested and charged with contravening county by-laws. Among those charged are Jane Asena, the caretaker of Karachi House and Charles Ndung’u Mwangi, a director of one of the buildings along Latema Road. City Hall named Loise House along Latema Road, Jiame House along Haille Selasie Avenue, Karachi House (River Road), Leon House (Tom Mboya Street), Contrust House (Moi Avenue), Ambassador House (Moi Avenue) and Commercial House among those that have not complied. Acting county secretary Leboo Morintat said those being targeted for arrest are building caretakers and users. “We believe that they all read our notice published in the local dailies and that is why we are going for them,” Morintat said. He said the county will close buildings that have not been repainted. Health and inspectorate officers have been inspecting the building since Wednesday to ascertain whether owners have complied with Governor Mike Sonko’s directive that was issued three months ago. Sonko said all buildings in the CBD must be repainted to improve the beauty of the city. Nairobi has been recognised as the most dynamic, innovative and among safe cities in the world, a status Sonko says he's keen on protecting. The governor has previously said the ongoing beautification project should include repainting of buildings to make the city more attractive.  edited by peter obuya
