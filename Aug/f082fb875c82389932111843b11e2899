Two gangsters have been shot dead by police officers in Nairobi. The deceased persons were gunned down by undercover detectives at Huruma in Mathare subcounty on Monday evening. While speaking to the Star on phone, Nairobi Regional Police Commander Philip Ndolo said the incident occurred at about 1830 hours. “These were people breaking and stealing from members of the public. Members of the public called the police who responded to the distress call,” Ndolo said. “The officers were not aware that the suspects were armed in broad daylight, the thugs shot at the police when they arrived at the scene prompting the fire exchange.” The police boss said that the two died on the spot. “The two fatalities resulted from an exchange of live fire after the gang defied a lawful order by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) detectives to surrender and firing at them. The gang of four was neutralized before their robbery mission,” Ndolo said. The bodies were removed to City mortuary. According to Ndolo, police recovered a pistol with two rounds of ammunition and two spent cartridges. He said police were pursuing two accomplices who fled to Mathare valley.
