A 240-bed capacity oncology ward has been completed at the Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital. It cost the Embu county government Sh70 million to build the ward. Cancer patients will no longer travel to Nairobi, Nakuru and other parts of the country in search of treatment. Governor Martin Wambora, who commissioned the ward, said patients will begin  receiving treatment from today. "There will be clinics every Tuesday of the week. The ward will start receiving patients on Tuesday," Wambora said. He said the oncology treatment at the referral hospital will be one of the most comprehensive in Mt Kenya region. The county government has trained doctors, clinical officers and nurses who will work in the ward, Wambora said. “We have equipped the ward for early detection of cancer,” he said. The county government is also on course to complete and equip a molecular laboratory that will be offering DNA sample dialysis. “We will no longer be taking our samples for laboratory analysis to South Africa. We will do the tests here,” he said. Wambora said he is determined to support President Uhuru Kenyatta's Big Four agenda of health. "We will set up 20 more health facilities across the county and upgrade the existing ones," he said. Embu Health executive Joan Mwende said the county will use part of the money collected during the recently held cancer marathon to buy more modern equipment for the new ward. Mwende said completion of the oncology ward will save residents huge financial costs  and psychological trauma since treatment will be offered near them.
