Is there trouble in paradise? After the baby shower on Thursday night at a posh Dar es Salaam hotel, Diamond and his boys went out and partied hard. In videos seem by Word Is, Diamond was dancing and drinking copious amounts of alcohol. Tanasha was nowhere to be seen and at one point, Vera Sidika was spotted hanging out with them together with her doctor bae, Jimmy Chansa. Vera revealed that a bold Nigerian man tried to woo her by sending champagne to her table. Anyhow, It seems Tanasha is not at all happy about being left out of the festivities. She posted a cryptic message that could only target one person, her baby daddy Diamond. “And Yeah, I love my baby daddy, but if he f**k other b***h, I won’t ever touch him. He knows it.”
