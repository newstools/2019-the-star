"The publication belongs to journalists and they will be given the space and autonomy to write on whatever issue they wish as long as it’s about what is affecting the industry,” reiterated Mr. Otieno. Contributors include current and former editors, scholars and industry players and other experts. The publication will be guided by an Editorial Board including serving and former editors and scholars: Joseph Odindo (chairman), Churchill Otieno, Wangethi Mwangi, Mutuma Mathiu, Macharia Gaitho, Ochieng Rapuro, Pamella Sittoni, Christine Nguku, Joe Ageyo, George Nyabuga, Arthur Okwemba and Rosalia Omungo.
