Alphas Kishoyian is hoping to anchor the men’s 4x400m relay team to stardom after missing out on a medal in the individual category in the Africa Games which end tomorrow. In an interview, Kishoyian said he would have performed better were it not for the fatigue. He said the fact that the nationals were ran just the other day and he had to do two races here in less than 24 hours had left him exhausted. Kishoyian placed fifth in 45.97 in a race won by Botswana’s Scotch Teungo. He said he is happy the race was competitive with all of them having run under 46. “Anyone would have won the race because at the end it was a crowded finish,” he noted. All the same time, he noted that his focus will now turn on World Championships and he is ready for the trials in Nairobi in two weeks. He, however, said that he will try to strategise with his teammates in the 4x400m to see if they can push for a medal. Mary Moraa, who was pushing for a top-three finish in the women’s 400m, said she would have achieved her target were it not for a slight injury she sustained the previous day. She also admitted that she had a stage fright considering the presence of some of the top sprinting nations. “This was a good experience and I am going to use it to improve on my performance. I know Doha is next for me and I want to use the remaining period to push for better results,” she noted. Moraa was placed fourth in the women’s 400m after clocking 51.97. Moroko Galefele of Botswana won the race in 51.30 while Favour Cofili from Nigeria snatched silver in 51.60. Grace Obuor of Ghana completed the top three places in 51.86.
