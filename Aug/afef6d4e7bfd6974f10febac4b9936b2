Beach volleyball women's national team of Gaudencia Makokha and Naomi Too shift focus to the conventional volleyball after a successful outing at the 12th edition of All Africa Games. The duo jetted back to the country on Sunday from Rabat, Morocco where they won a silver medal, Kenya's first gong in beach volleyball at the AAG. Both Makokha and Too turn out for former women's volleyball league champions Kenya Pipeline, playing in the opposite and outside positions respectively. Makokha said they are waiting for the continental Olympic qualification tournament and they look forward to the preparation program from Kenya Volleyball Federation. “The beach volleyball calendar is not congested, so we return to club volleyball until when the federation notifies us otherwise. We do not have communication of any local beach volleyball action for next month,” said Makokha. “For now we rest a little bit before joining club training. However, we will have a little BVB training in between as we anticipate more competitions,” she added. After going down to Egypt in the AAG beach volleyball final, Too intimates that they picked valuable lessons from the whole showpiece and that they can only get better going forward. She said: “The tournament was a success for us. We learned a few things here and there, corrected what we could as the competitions went on and we will work on other areas that we, together with the coach feel we fell short.”
