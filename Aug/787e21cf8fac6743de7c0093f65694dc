Juventus are said to be ‘irritated’ after manager Maurizio Sarri ‘refused to stop smoking’ as the Italian looks set to return to the touchline very soon, according to reports in Italy. The former Chelsea boss, 60, was diagnosed with pneumonia earlier this month and has missed the Old Lady’s first two Serie A games after taking advice from club doctors. And after signs of improvement in the Italian’s health, it looks like Sarri may be given the green light to make a return to the touchline for Juve’s upcoming game against his old club Napoli. Following the diagnosis, it is said that Juventus’ top brass are concerned with Sarri’s smoking habits, and would prefer for their manager to stop smoking while being treated for the infection. However, Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera published an image of the Juventus manager holding a packet of cigarettes while posing with fans outside his home earlier this week, suggesting that the 60-year-old will be defying the wishes of his bosses. It is believed that the Juventus hierarchy are ‘irritated’ by Sarri’s choice, and would prefer the coach to focus on his return to full fitness. Sarri, a former banker, has developed a reputation for smoking during games. When he was at Napoli he was often seen lighting a cigarette during the game - a habit he had to give up during the sole season he spent in West London. While at Stamford Bridge, Sarri would chew cigarette filters to quench his appetite. Juventus face Napoli at home on Saturday evening.
