New coach Antonio Conte hailed Romelu Lukaku after the striker scored on his debut as Inter Milan made a flying start in Serie A with a 4-0 win over promoted Lecce on Monday night. Speaking after the match, Conte insisted that Inter had struck a good deal in signing Lukaku from Manchester United, pointing out that the initial down-payment of £59m will be paid over five years. The fee can eventually rise to £73m with add-ons but Conte is more than happy with his new signing, who he tried to bring back to Chelsea while Stamford Bridge boss. “I am very happy and satisfied. I like working with these guys who have always shown great willingness,” said Conte. “Tonight, Lukaku showed why we tried so hard to sign him.” “Lukaku has come into the Inter world in the best possible way, with great humility. He is a gentle giant, a giant with a smile. He’s ready to work for the team.” “Let’s not forget Lukaku cost €65m to be paid over five years, so when people talk about big money spent, it wasn’t even that much.” Marcelo Brozovic, with an exquisite curling shot, and Stefano Sensi gave Inter a 2-0 half-time lead before Lukaku, signed from United this month, opened his account on the hour. Antonio Candreva then completed the rout with a stunning strike. Chinese-owned Inter appointed Conte, who previously won three Serie A titles with Juventus and one English Premier League title with Chelsea, to replace Luciano Spalletti in the close season in a bid to end eight seasons without a major trophy.
