Homeowners in Jericho village, Gikingi location, on the outskirts of Nyahururu town are to blame for their soggy neighbourhood, Nema has said. Ezra Ng'ang'a, the Nyandarua county director for National Environment Management Authority (Nema), said the residents have built on the spillage way of the 50 by 100 water pan, with most homes sitting on the wetland that had several areas still oozing water. The residents had accused the proprietor of Busara Academy of building a dam that was spilling into their homes. "The water pan and the homes are built on the springs and waterways. The land had earlier been allowed for farming but plot owners subdivided their portions for sale without even considering the change of user requirements," the Nema official said. He added that the assessment done by his office and the Water Resources Management Authority had shown that though the water pan lacked adequate ridges, its spew way was adequate to serve its capacity. Nyandarua West deputy county commissioner Hezron Nyambegi, who had earlier visited the scene when the residents raised the alarm over "the dam bursting its banks", noted that the water pan posed no risk. "Developers building on waterways should ensure they donâ€™t divert water to neighbours. The county government, too, should ensure culverts and drainage systems are cleared and more constructed to avert disaster," he said.
