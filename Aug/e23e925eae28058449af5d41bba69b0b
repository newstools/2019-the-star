Boda boda operators in Yatta, Machakos county, have been asked to stay clean and treat their customers courteously. Over 700 riders who were trained on operating the bikes by Yatta CDF office gathered at Matuu Primary School to collect their licenses. The training took three months in four different schools across the constituency. They were trained on how to ride a motorbike and road safety rules. Machakos Deputy Governor Francis Maliti urged the youths to always practice excellent customer care to win more business. “This is your office. Ensure you offer the best services to customers in order to create confidence among them and also attract more,” the DG said. Maliti told the riders to clean their bikes and take a bath for the comfort of the customer. Yatta MP Charles Kilonzo told the operators to work closely with security teams. “Ensure you follow traffic rules as you have been trained so that you will not be seeking to escape once you see security officers. Make them your friends,” he said. Yatta deputy county commissioner Emma Kibara lauded the riders for participating in the three-month exercise, urging them to put to practice what they learnt. She told the youths to help security teams by alerting officials in case of any incidents that need attention. Yatta deputy subcounty police commander George Kashmir said motorbikes had eased public transport although some operators used them to commit crime. “Be very careful on who you carry and in case you doubt the client you are carrying immediately inform us,” Kashmir said. The riders were advised to avoid crime such as rape and defilement, use of alcohol while working and violation of traffic rules .
