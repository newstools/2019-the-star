You will now have to book an appointment before collecting your passport, this is according to the Immigration Department. The Department of Immigration Services has introduced an appointment system for applicants seeking to acquire the new generation passports. The department said an individual is required to book an appointment through the e-citizen portal specifying the date and time to collect the passport. One is required to provide the appointment slip and original national identification card before collecting the passport. Those wishing to replace their passports are required to include the expired or old passports. The department said those who are sick and in urgent appointment to travel abroad for treatment, as well as students on scholarships who also require to immediately travel abroad, are not liable to the new system. Public servants on urgent official assignment abroad and business executives on urgent official business visits areÂ also exempted by the system. The department said that the application system will end long queues that had been witnessed in all passport centres. The government extended the deadline for e-passports to March 1, 2020, for all Kenyans.
