Barcelona wonder-kid Carles Alena has spoken out on the ongoing situation regarding Neymar and admitted he hopes the Brazilian returns to the Nou Camp this summer. The transfer window remains open in Spain and France and Neymar was recently left out of the Paris Saint Germain squad due to increasing transfer talks. But Alena has revealed a fear within the Barca camp that Neymar could end up making a late summer move to ‘eternal rivals’ Real Madrid, and join Zinedine Zidane’s Galacticos at the eleventh hour. “It would hurt if Neymar went to our eternal rival, especially after playing (for Barcelona),” Alena told reporters following Barca’s recent pre-season victory over Napoli. “We hope that he comes back. He’s a spectacular player, one of the best in the world. “If he comes back it would be an amazing signing, it would be an incredible way to close the transfer window. He would make us all better.” Madrid have already failed this summer in their pursuit of Manchester United’s wantaway star Paul Pogba, who remained at Old Trafford as the transfer window closed early in England. Now the Spanish giants are understood to be putting their sole focus onto the signing of Neymar as a result. With discussions ongoing between different parties, Neymar was omitted for the clash against Nimes, with PSG sporting director Leonardo saying that talks regarding a possible transfer are ‘more advanced’. “Talks are more advanced than before,” Leonardo was quoted as saying by French newspaper L’Equipe. Leonardo refused to specify about the progress of the negotiations. The Spanish transfer window doesn’t close until September 2, meaning there is plenty of time to get a deal done that would see Neymar return to La Liga. Neymar missed Brazil’s success at the Copa America last month because of an ankle problem but is close to regaining full fitness.
