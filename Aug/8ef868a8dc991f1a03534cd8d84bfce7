Police in Embu are investigating an officer who allegedly assaulted a woman and broke her arm. The officer based at Mugoya police station reportedly attacked Janet Karimi who was walking home at 10pm last Wednesday and threw her into a ditch. Karimi said the officer is well known to her. She was rescued by boda boda operators who took her to Tenri hospital in Majimbo. Karimi said the officer was drunk and she does not know why he assaulted her yet they are friends. She said her efforts to report the assault to Mugoya police station were thwarted by officers who denied her entry into the station. She went to Embu police station where she reported and recorded a statement. Karimi said no action has been taken. The woman said she spent Sh4,000 on treatment at Tenri hospital. She is unable to work because of her broken arm. She said she is the sole breadwinner of her family. Embu West police boss Julius Meli confirmed that Karimi reported the matter to the station. He said they are investigating. "The woman reported the assault to us. We cannot allow uniformed police officers to harass civilians whom they are supposed to protect," Meli said.
