Jubilee on Wednesday urged all aspirants interested in seeking the party's  ticket for the Kibra by-election to apply by the close of business on Friday. Jubilee had on Monday announced its decision to participate in the forthcoming Kibra by-elections. The IEBC on Monday received a list of names from the party shortlisting aspirants for the by-election. However, the party termed the list fake. The party has now decided to call for a fresh list of aspirants. The NEB will scrutinise all applications and invite all those who are compliant for interviews between August 31 and September 2. "We encourage all interested aspirants to obtain application documents from the office of the party directorate of the elections," the statement said. "All matters announcement on the elections will only be done through the Chairman of the NEB, Mr  Andrew Musangi until after the nomination process is completed." Jubilee says only the Chairman of the NEB is authorised to be quoted by the media on matters related to the nomination process as he has the powers to delegate authority. Jubilee further says the office of the secretary-general has no role under the party constitution to deal with nominations issues other than communicating the decision of the NEB after receiving written communication from the chair of the NEB. The party says it would like to assure members and aspirants that it is the commitment of the party to adhere to the dictates of its procedures and constitution in identifying the right candidates for the forthcoming by-election and all others in the future. The party says the methodology being used in this instance is one of the three authorised by the Jubilee party constitution.
