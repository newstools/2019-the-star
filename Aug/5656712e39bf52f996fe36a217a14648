Treatment of cancer patients kicked off at the newly launched oncology centre at the Embu Level 5  Hospital on Tuesday. Two clinical oncologists from Kenyatta National Hospital, Isaac Michemi and Primus Ochieng’, are part of the team of medics carrying out the treatment. Embu Health executive Joan Mwende said the visiting clinical oncologists were enlisted to the facility’s board, which comprises specialists in different medical fields. “The visiting oncologists will provide a road map while carrying out the operations. The facility will be offering chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgical treatments of cancer. We have everything in place and treatment starts today,” she said. The first 15 cancer patients were on Tuesday admitted to the cancer centre. Mwende said the hospital has already started receiving inquiries from Meru, Isiolo and Marsabit. The Sh70 million 240-bed oncology centre was commissioned by Embu Governor Martin Wambora on Friday. Wambora  said the centre is equipped with state-of-the-art equipment to detect cancer at early stages. “The county government has trained doctors, nurses and clinical officers who will be running the oncology centre. It will be the most comprehensive in the Mt Kenya region and will ensure high level service to the people,” he said. The centre's front office is equipped with five oncology chairs where patients sit during chemotherapy, meaning it can serve to five cancer patients simultaneously. The Ministry of Health has donated medical equipment to the centre.
