A man charged with failing to obey instructions from a police officer has told court that he did so due to drunkenness. Kibera chief magistrate Joyce Gandani ordered him to pay a fine of Sh,8000 for the offence. Macharia Mugane told Kibera chief magistrate Joyce Gandani that he lacked energy and mental ability to follow the command. “I’d been drugged by my friend and I never heard the instructions,”he said. Mugane was accused of ignoring the police on August 29 along Naivasha road within Nairobi.
