Celebrated comedienne Eunice Wambui popularly known as Nyasuguta says she is joining church ministry away from doing comedy. This is to strengthen her relationship with God. The comedian and former Embakasi South parliamentary aspirant says most celebrities do not get time to serve the church. She was involved in an accident month ago which she says was her turning point. Speaking to Word Is, she said, "God is preparing me to be bigger and go for missions to serve him and people. I will be serving God more than doing comedy." It was a way He was preparing me to start ministering," she said. This is the second time she has been involved in an accident and she says it is an opportunity she has to serve God. The first time was in 2013, that left her face dented that she even bleached her face."The dent was lighter than other parts of my face, consequently making me look like a person who has two facial complexions in one. I saw it wise to bleach so that my face gets an even skin tone. It is my mum who encouraged me," she said. "I know I got the accident to be able to get time with my God, You know we celebs sometimes, we become so busy that we even forget to serve God." "When I was admitted to the hospital, I got time to even read the Bible. Sometimes, when the pastor is preaching and they see like the church is boring, they tend to invite us to entertain the congregation. Hadi unasahau ulikuja church kuomba," Nyasuguta said. Her TV husband, Francis Njenga better known as Mogaka will be ministering together with her. "We want to start poaching souls to Christ," she said. Recently, the talented actress said she was looking for a husband and that she was receiving applications from serious people only. "I am very single and looking for a husband," she told Word Is last Friday. "The person should be God-fearing and one who will not see me as a sponsor but should have their money."
