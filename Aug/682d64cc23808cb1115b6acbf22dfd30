In his official Twitter handle and Facebook, he has disputed claims of suffering mild stroke and termed as rumors,” he said. On Tuesday night Governor Nanok on his official Twitter handle said, “I am well at home. Other media publishing I have a mild stroke are telling untruth.” “Colleagues, ignore social media about me. I do not have a stroke and nobody should wish I have one. I was unwell last week and admitted majorly to undertake medical tests which turned good,” a message seen by Star states.
