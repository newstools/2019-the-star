A top media personality was recently milked by a fling he met at a social joint. The lady trapped the celebrity and after an hour of pleasure, she started extorting money from him. He tried to evade but the lady threatened to teach him a lesson by reporting him to police accusing him of rape. "If you don't pay me you'll spend the rest of your life behind bars," a close friend to the married media personality whispered to Word Is. The man in question is known for sampling different women and even pays rent for quite a number of women around. He is always attracted to young women and according to his friends, he has so far learnt a lesson the hard way but is still living in fear that the lady might turn against him.
