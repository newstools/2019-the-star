A new building under construction at General Mathenge Drive opposite Auto express has caught fire. Seven workers were injured at the building called The Promenade, which had not been occupied. The structure that was engulfed in huge plumes of dark smoke stands at the same construction site where a wall collapsed and killed four construction workers in July 2016. The site's project manager Clement Moi said the wall was overpowered by the loose soil. He said there were 200 employees at the site and that the families of the deceased have been notified.
