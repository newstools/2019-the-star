The Health ministry will continue engaging clinical officers so Kenyans do not suffer, CS Sicily Kariuki said yesterday. She, however, dismissed media reports that the clinical officers had issued a strike notice. Kenyans are still suffering because of the nurses’ strike. “We wish to inform Kenyans that both sides have agreed to continue engaging in good faith to ensure uninterrupted services,” Sicily said. She issued a joint statement with Kenya Union of Clinical Officers secretary general George Gibore. The two parties signed a recognition agreement as part of the ongoing dialogue on labour relations. On February 9, the union had issued an ultimatum to the ministry over what they termed “stalled talks”. KUCO officials said talks initiated in December 2017 collapsed in April last year and the government has been unwilling to return to the negotiating table. Gibore told the Star the ministry and the county governments had shown commitment to resolve the issues. He said 90 per cent of the issues had been agreed upon by the time the government walked out in April. Click here for the latest political stories.
