From a reduced risk of early death to feeling more confident in your own skin, maintaining a healthy weight has many benefits. But new research suggests weight-loss surgery could even give your sex life a boost. A study of more than 2,000 morbidly-obese patients revealed they were more sexually active, driven and satisfied even five years after going under the knife. The research was carried out by North Dakota State University and led by Dr Kristine Steffen, from the school of pharmacy. Obesity has previously been linked to poor 'sexual quality-of-life', the authors wrote in the journal JAMA Surgery. Although past studies have shown weight-loss surgery boosts a heavy person's sex life, these have often been small, with a short follow-up. In the first research to look at outcomes after five years, the researchers analysed 2,036 adults who took part in The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 study at ten hospitals throughout the US. All the patients - most of whom had a laparoscopic gastric bypass - were morbidly obese, with an average BMI approaching 46. A BMI of 30 or more is considered obese.They were all around 47 and 78.9 per cent were female. Before going under the knife, the patients completed a questionnaire that asked about their sexual satisfaction, desire and activity. They were also asked the extent to which their size limits them from having intercourse. This questionnaire was completed again one and five years on. Results revealed that 70 per cent of the women and 74 per cent of the men were not sexually satisfied before their weight-loss surgery. But a year on, 56 per cent of these females and 49.2 per cent of the males reported improvements. Some 60 per cent of the women and 67 per cent of the men also complained of 'sexual restrictions' due to their size before they went under the knife. But five years later, 73.6 per cent of the women and 67.7 per cent of the men were still enjoying the benefits. Click here for the latest political news
