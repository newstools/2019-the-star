The county government of Bungoma has launched public participation into its planned Medium Term Expenditure Framework. Finance executive Esther Wamalwa said the report was part of the Public Finance Management Act and takes into account a review of previous financial years. Speaking while launching the program in Tongaren subcounty, Wamalwa said the review helps in informing the County Fiscal Strategy Paper and planning. “The report is prepared taking into account the review of previous financial years and using lessons learnt and and best practices to help us plan for the future,” she said. Wamalwa said the county wants proper strategies to aid development and reduce poverty. “The priorities for the budget will be to direct investments into productive, social, environmental and governance sectors,” she said. The CEC said a governance sub-sector will help in the prevention, detection and elimination of corruption and waste of resources. This will be done jointly by national and county government institutions and promote accountability, she added. Wamalwa said the county has measures to ensure ensure prudent use of resources while also increasing its resource base.
