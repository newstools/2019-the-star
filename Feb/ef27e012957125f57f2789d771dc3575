Former Lamu Governor Issa Timamy has criticised the Supreme Court ruling that upheld the election of Fahim Twaha as the county boss. Timamy challenged Twaha’s election at the High Court before moving to the Court of Appeal. Judges in both courts upheld Twaha’s election. The Supreme Court ruling was delivered last week. Yesterday, Twaha said he will wait for 2022 to reclaim the seat. “I didn’t like the Supreme Court ruling but I have utmost respect for it,” Timamy said. He was addressing a huge crowd at Mkunguni Square in Lamu town in his first public appearance since the ruling was made. Timamy said he was sure he will unseat Twaha. Business was briefly disrupted as the crowd gathered to welcome Timamy on his first public tour to Lamu since he lost the election in 2017. The former county chief said it was unfortunate that residents did not get “the leadership they elected after my win was stolen.” “There is still hope in the next general election,” he said. He thanked supporters for standing with him. Former Deputy Governor Eric Mugo said Twaha’s government was unable to undertake development projects. He said the new administration was “pretending to work on projects” initiated by the previous regime. He accused Twaha of doing nothing to stop land grabbing. He further claimed that the number of squatters was rising. “Land grabbing is something we did our best to deal with and that’s why we made so many enemies. We fought for our people’s land rights,” Mugo said.
