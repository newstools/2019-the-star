President Uhuru Kenyatta's aides were on Sunday locked out of the 32nd AU Summit in Ethiopia in what appeared to be a protocol hitch. In a video posted on Twitter, Uhuru's Aide de Camp is seen struggling to get past the security detail at the entrance of the building where the summit was taking place. The Aide de Camp and another aide then decided to walk away from the area after a brief push and pull with security officers. The two are seen holding suitcases - probably containing Uhuru's notes - as they walk away from the door. The spectacle happened in the full glare of other government representatives from member states attending the conference. They, too, were having a rough time accessing the conference room. The summit kicked off on January 15 and will run till Monday, February 11.  A screengrab of the scuffle during the AU Summit in Addis Ababa, Sunday, February 10, 2019.
