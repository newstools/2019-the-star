A Riooga Secondary School dormitory was gutted by fire yesterday, barely six months after the school was closed following a mysterious fire. No one was injured. Nyamira county commissioner Amos Mariba said police were investigating to establish the cause. The dormitory that houses 60 girls was destroyed. Mariba said the dormitories were congested. The school has more than 1,500 students. Residents said the compound is too small for the large number of learners. Last year’s fire burnt three dormitories. Principal Nyaanga Rasugu was charged alongside Masaba North subcounty education director Anne Maina for permitting illegal holiday tuition. The two denied the charges before Keroka magistrate Lewis Gatheru. It is not known whether the fires were started by students or arsonists from outside. It was estimated that property worth Sh20 million was destroyed during last year’s fire. County director of education Nicodemus Anyang said an investigations report will be presented. He directed a halt in admission of new students. “We’ve agreed with management that the population is too big for available infrastructure,” Anyang said. Last year, eight Kisii Boys High School students were charged with arson. They denied the charges before Kisii senior resident magistrate Ezekiel Obina and were released on a Sh50,000 bail. The eight were accused of jointly and willfully setting ablaze a Sh6.9 million dorm. In nearby Narok county, four high school boys were charged last year with attempted arson. The students were found in possession of petrol. It was believed they wanted to use the fuel to burn St Anthony Boys Secondary School. They pleaded not guilty and were released on a Sh40,000 bail each.
