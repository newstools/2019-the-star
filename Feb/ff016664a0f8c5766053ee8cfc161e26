A Bomet boy suffering from hydrocephalus, water on the brain, was airlifted to Nairobi on Tuesday for treatment. The treatment will be sponsored by Deputy President William Ruto whose private chopper picked up Ian Kipkoech and his mother from Longisa village in Bomet East. Kipkoech’s condition attracted to attention of the DP when he presided over a function in Bomet on Saturday. The seven-year-old will undergo treatment at the Aga Khan Hospital. Ruto will pay the bill. Hydrocephalus is the buildup of fluid in the cavities within the brain. The excess fluid increases the size of the ventricles and puts pressure on the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid normally flows through the ventricles and bathes the brain and spinal column. The pressure of too much cerebrospinal fluid associated with hydrocephalus can damage brain tissues and cause f impairments in the organ’s functioning. Kipkoech’s mother Yvonne Chelang’at said she had unsuccessfully sought treatment for her son. The boy has been to Kikuyu, Kaplong and Longisa hospitals. Chelang’at said she had appealed to well-wishers and local leaders for funds tfor treatment. On Saturday as Ruto prepared to speak,the crowd demanded the boy be taken to him for help. His condition is well known in the area. Ruto announced he will foot the cost of Kipkoech’s treatment. “This is now my responsibility and I will take it upon myself to ensure he’s well,” Ruto said amid applause from the crowd.
