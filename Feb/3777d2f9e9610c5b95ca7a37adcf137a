Oserian Ladies have lost three of their dependable players to Tanzania’s Alliance Queens of Tanzania ahead of Football Kenya Federation (FKF) women’s Kenya Premier League, starting this weekend. The three are national team defender Anita Adongo, goal keeper Oliver Awour and midfielder Rael Kamande. Coach Hudson Odari confirmed the exit of the three and described the move as a major blow. “We will miss the services of the trio but I am hopeful of an improved performance going forward despite the loss,” he said. The Naivasha-based outfit finished in the sixth position last season. He, however, said they had signed six players from secondary school who will fill the gaps. “As a coach, you don’t stand in the way of players who want out. In a way, this creates room for others to showcase their talent,” said Odari. He added: “We begun poorly last season and lost five matches in a row and by the time we started winning, it was already too late and we were playing catch up which was not good. This time around, we want to start well and go all the way as we seek to challenge for the title.” Oserian start their league campaign against Makolanders on Sunday at Camp Toyoyo and the tactician has predicted a tough match. “We have had a good pre-season and we are set for the league. I know the season will be competitive but we are up to the challenge.”
