Murang'a nurses have suspended their strike. In a letter on Monday signed by the branch secretary Lucy Mburu and addressed to Murang’a county secretary Patrick Mukuria, the nurses said the move is in line with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive to have all of them resume work. Mburu said the suspension is also in respect to a ruling made by the Industrial Court that declared the strike illegal. The nurses had issued a strike notice from last week Monday in solidarity with their counterparts from other parts of the country. The secretary said that all their union members had been instructed to continue serving the people of Murang’a. Mburu also lauded governor Mwangi wa Iria for his efforts in ending the people’s sufferings and employment of more nurses.
