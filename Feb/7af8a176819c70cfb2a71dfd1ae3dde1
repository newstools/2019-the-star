President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday issued a directive to all government agencies to create a single system of revenue collection. He said this will play a key role in eliminating duplication of efforts and waste of resources. “At present, the counties utilise 11 different revenue collection systems, which do not integrate with those used by the national government, or even those used by other counties. The bottom line is, this has severely limited the amount of revenue collected by the counties,” he said at KICC. He was updated on the geospatial data.
