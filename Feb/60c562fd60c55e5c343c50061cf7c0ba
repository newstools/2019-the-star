Fish traders in Busia will be temporarily relocated to Marachi estate to allow construction of a Sh63 million cross-border fish market. The 600 traders will be moved in the next two weeks. The six-month project is set to start at the Busia border fish export and import market. Animal Resources chief officer Richard Achiambo on Saturday said Busia will host the biggest Cage Fish workshop next month. It will draw participants from East Africa. County director of fisheries Timothy Odede said completion of the one-storey building will make it the largest handling transshipment facility. The products will be destined for East and Central Africa markets. “The market generates Sh1.2 billion in trade, but with the completion of the new facility, the figure will rise to Sh2 billion,” he said. Odede said the market will also serve as a distribution network for omena and tilapia. Burumba MCA Moses Ochieng warned the fishmongers against cartels who may try to fleece them under the pretext that it’s free land. “Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has given the construction of the market top priority” he said. Ochieng said Busia has received municipality charter and Sh110 million has been released for the town’s upgrade. Businessman Bishop Sireka said the new market will offer a one stop shop for local fish and those from Lake Turkana and Uganda.
