The Media Council of Kenya has commended radio journalists for beating challenges to ensure Kenyans are informed through the medium. Speaking in honour of World Radio Day, MCK deputy CEO Victor Bwire said radio still commands the largest audience in the country compared to Television and online platforms. This year marks the 8th edition of World Radio Day with a theme dubbed 'Dialogue, tolerance and peace'. Bwire said this can be attributed to the fact that there are various stations broadcasting in the two national languages as well as vernacular, making it easy for the audience to tune to their preferred stations. He said currently, there are about 179 radio stations in Kenya most of which broadcast in vernacular languages. "This has made it possible it possible for Kenyans to not only access news and information but also participate in debates and discussions," he said. Bwire added, "Vernacular stations have enhanced listenership because there are Kenyans who do not understand English or Kiswahili". He said though there are a number of challenges being faced by media houses and radio journalists, MCK is committed to ensuring that they addressed. "We have experienced situations where radio journalists have received threats to their lives, especially while investigating corruption cases. We are doing our best to ensure that we train them on relevant safety measures". He said. According to Bwire, radio has great potential for growth as there are many people who listen in as well as corporates willing to advertise their services. Bwire, however, called on journalists to uphold professionalism in their work because the audience holds them in high regard. "Some radio personalities have not been trained in journalism and this is a bit challenging", he said. Click here for the latest political news.
