Nurses at Mathari National Teaching and Referral Hospital plan to join their striking colleagues today. Mathari is the only psychiatric facility in Kenya, with a capacity of 675 patients. The strike started in many counties on Monday last week and enters its eighth day today. Nurses from Samburu, Kirinyaga, Embu and the National Spiral Injury Referral Hospital, Port Health and Blood Transfusion Centre will also stay away from work. The last time Mathari nurses went on strike, their mentally-ill patients walked out of the facility. On Friday, nurses union boss Seth Panyako said they will not return to work until their demands are met. This is despite a court order that last week suspended the strike for 60 days to allow for talks. “We’re ready to go to jail but won’t allow someone to take nurses for a ride,” he said. His deputy Maurice Opetu said only Kwale, Nairobi, Migori and Machakos have implemented the return-to-work formula signed on November 2, 2017. Click here for the latest political news
