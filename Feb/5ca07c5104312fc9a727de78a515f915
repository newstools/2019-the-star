Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti has reshuffled his Cabinet two weeks after the Supreme Court upheld his reelection. Awiti said on Thursday that he made the changes to improve services. “The public wants to see service delivery. Therefore, each Cabinet member must be up to the task. I will not tolerate laziness,” he said. David Okeyo has been transferred from Roads to Trade. The Trade docket fell vacant after former executive Carilus Ademba resigned on Monday. Fred Odero has been moved from Energy to Sports. Odero replaces Roselyne Odhiambo who now heads Lands. Odhiambo has taken over from Beatrice Ogolla who was transferred Energy. Nicholas Koriko (Finance), Aguko Juma (Agriculture), Richard Muga (Health), Beatrice Asyago (Education) and Dickson Nyawinda (Water) retained their dockets. Awiti nominated Philemon Opar to head the Roads department. Muga will act as the Roads boss, pending Opar’s vetting by the county assembly and subsequent appointment by the county chief.
