Two MPs from Murang’a have faulted Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka for recommending the extension of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s term. Ndindi Nyori (Kiharu) and Peter Kimari (Mathioya) said the recommendations are retrogressive and could plunge the country back to the “dark days of the Kanu era”. Ndindi said he was shocked to see Kalonzo calling for an extension yet he is part of the Opposition that went around the country telling Kenyans he (Uhuru) was not fit to lead them. He has a sinister motive, he said, expressing concerns that there could be plans to ruin President Uhuru’s legacy. The MP noted that most long term presidents in the continent only attract contempt from their people, citing the case of former Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe. “Mugabe helped free the country from the whites but his people got fed up with him and detested him,” he said. Kimari said such a change to the law would take the country back to having lifelong presidents and that a constitutional review should only focus on strengthening the government’s structures. “Most of the governors pushing for it are those whose terms are ending,” he said. The two spoke at Karung’e primary school in Mathioya subcounty during Ahadi Kenya CEO Stanley Kamau’s 50th birthday.
