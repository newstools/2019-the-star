A service at AIC Chebitet local church in Bureti, Kericho county was on Sunday disrupted when worshippers went for each other’s throats after Bishop Silas Yego's faction, AIC Kenya, was finally recognised as the legitimate group to lead the church. The worship and prayer service was cut short after a court order declaring the legitimacy of AIC Kenya group was read to the faithful by the church secretary Wesley Cheruiyot. Fighting broke out when the chairman of the Bishop David Mbuvi led group, Mr David Rotich, interjected and went for Cheruiyot's neck, cutting short the reading of the statement much to the bewilderment of the faithful. Rotich is said to have torn Cheruiyot's clothes as they wrestled on the floor. It was then that the congregation exchanged kicks and blows bringing the service to a halt.
