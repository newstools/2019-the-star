The government’s plan for 100 per cent transition to secondary schools is faltering due to shortage of teachers. An assessment by the Teacher’s Service Commission shows 12,626 teachers are needed for the increased population in secondary school. The transition rate to secondary schools is at 92 per cent. This means at least 949,747 are in school. “There is a shortage of 87,381 teachers in both primary and secondary schools. But this does not include the teachers required for 100 per cent transition,” TSC boss Nancy Macharia told Parliament’s Education committee yesterday. The TSC in January announced it would recruit 5,000 teachers to support the 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary school. Macharia yesterday said they require at least Sh20 billion to accomplish that. The commission wants Parliament to raise the funds required for hiring teachers.

The TSC statistics show that at least 30 counties are in this category. Acute shortage has been registered in Kakamega, where 6,408 teachers are needed in both primary and secondary schools, Bungoma ( 5,186 ), Kitui ( 4,539 ), Homa Bay ( 3,888 ) and Migori ( 3,716 ). Kenya Secondary School Heads Association yesterday told the Star facilities are stretched thin due to the high number of students. As a priority, the commission wants to hire interns. “We seek Parliament to lobby for funds from the Exchequer as the commission seeks to employ interns,” Macharia said.
