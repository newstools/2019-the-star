Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology students on Friday demonstrated in Juja to protest against the brutal murder of one of their own. The students accused police officers stationed near the institution of laxity and failing to protect them. A first year female student was stabbed to death on Thursday night near Seagull Hotel in Juja as she tried to fight off thugs. Tabitha Muthoni was stabbed in the neck. The thugs were trying to rob her of a mobile phone and cash. She was in the company of a friend. “The thugs demanded money and phones. I immediately cooperated, she did not, hence they stabbed her in the neck,” her friend said. Muthoni was pronounced dead on arrival at a Juja hospital. JKUAT has made headlines in the past three years over numerous murder of students. In February 2017, police officers attached to the Juja police station found body parts belonging to Grace Nduta stuffed in a bucket and hidden in a ceiling of a house in Kahawa Sukari. In the same year in July, Tabitha Kitaa’s body was found near Juja after she went missing for a week. Last year in May, Tim Sydney was stabbed to death by suspected thugs as he was heading to the hostels.
