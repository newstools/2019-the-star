Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) men’s Premier League outfit Greensharks head coach Ben Owaga is tired of playing second fiddle to the duo of Kenya Police and Butali Warriors and has challenged his charges to muscle up for the title when the 2019 season gets underway on March 2. The men’s title has proved a preserve of Butali and Police in the recent years with Greensharks coming third but the club has vowed to break the dominance of the duo and lay hands on the crown at the end of the season. According to Owaga, his side will leave nothing to chance and will be looking to right the costly errors committed in the previous seasons among them inconsistency in the second leg. Greensharks have always had promising first legs each season but have failed to replicate the same in the final stanza which Owaga says will be addressed in the ongoing preseason. He said his absence at times in the dugout due to military commitments was also to blame for dismal show. The tactician revealed his blueprint of breaking the title jinx this season where he challenged his charges to take a game at a time and have their sights trained on scooping maximum points from each encounter.
