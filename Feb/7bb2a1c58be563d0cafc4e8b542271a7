On January 29, Empire actor Jussie Smollet was reported to be the victim of an alleged racist, homophobic attack. Smollett plays a gay character of "Jamal" on the Fox TV drama series. News of the reported assault went viral and was met with mixed reactions online, with many suggesting the incident was a hoax. Smollett Lawyers on February 17, denied he had any role in the assault. He confirmed that the assault was carried out by two white men. Their statement came after sources told US media that police believed he may have paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack on January 29. The brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo worked as extras on Empire, a drama about a hip-hop mogul and his family. Police have only said the "trajectory of the investigation" has shifted. "We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the Empire case has, in fact, shifted the trajectory of the investigation. We've reached out to the Empire cast member's attorney to request a follow-up interview," Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. Empire is a story unlike any other. For one, it is an all-black A-list cast, which is uncommon in the industry for a ‘black show’ to have a prime time slot with an overwhelming number of viewers. Because of the increasing number of viewers every week, Empire was renewed for a second season just 10 days after the original premiere. The power of the show is definitely in the scripting, which is carefully and systematically told. The show is an insight into how the real world of the music industry operates.
