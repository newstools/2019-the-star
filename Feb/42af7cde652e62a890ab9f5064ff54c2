A fire on Saturday burnt a dormitory in which 195 students were sleeping in at Nyamanga Mixed Secondary in Ndhiwa, Homa Bay. Ndhiwa police Dishon Chadaka said no one was injured during the 3am blaze in the boys' dorm. However, students lost their personal belongings. The cause of the fire has not been established but arson is suspected. PTA chairman Dan Nyakwana said the management suspects seven suspended students are behind the fire. The students were sent home after sneaking out of school to attend a "disco matanga" (A funeral disco). The students refused to go home and had adamantly tried to remain in school, he said. "The suspects threatened to teach those behind their suspension a lesson," Nyakwana said.

"We have launched investigations to establish the cause of the fire," he said. "We appeal to people with information to come forward so that we can speed up investigations," Chadaka said.
