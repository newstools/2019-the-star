The Rwandan government wants the parliament to pass a bill banning single-use plastics in the country to protect the environment. The draft bill suggests a two-year moratorium for companies to stop manufacturing single-use plastics. Plastics were first banned in Rwanda back in 2008 but some plastic materials are still used, including mineral water and juice bottles, straws in bars and hotels and single-use dishes. The government wants to take a further move to ban these too. A bill will be sent to parliament for a vote. Click here for the latest political stories.
