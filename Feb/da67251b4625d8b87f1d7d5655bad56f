Haki Africa has called for the formal recognition of social justice centres and their work in the county. In a statement on Wednesday to mark the United Nations World Day for Social Justice, the organisation said many of the grassroots campaigners have lost their lives in their quest for social justice. Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid said as a country we must safeguard our rights and freedoms. "This includes ensuring those fighting for rights of others are equally protected," Khalid said. "We will not allow the county to go back to the dark days of the 1980s of detention without trial, imprisonment without fair hearing and killing without justice," he said. Nairobi alone has more than 11 justice centres. He said the government has a duty to not only support human rights but also support social justice activists. He said the workers have to be protected as they are operating under very dangerous circumstances hence their lives remain at risk. The day is dedicated to recognising that social justice is an underlying principle for peaceful and prosperous coexistence within and among nations. The day comes as the family of late Caroline Mwatha prepares for her burial this Saturday. Mwatha was a founding member and a senior official at the Dandora Community Justice Centre. She was reported missing and later her lifeless body found at City mortuary. An autopsy conducted confirmed reports by police she had died from a botched abortion. The activist was documenting several cases of extrajudicial killings of youth by police in Dandora.
