The Busia government will honour the outcome of talks on the nurses on uniforms and allowances, Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has said. “Instead of being dictatorial, I have come here to engage with you and urge you to rescind the strike decision until the outcome of the reconciliation talks,” he said on Monday. The governor spoke to striking nurses at the Busia County Referral Hospital. Ojaamong said there is money to pay the nurses and the county government is only waiting for advice from the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. The governor told the nurses to urge the Kenya National Union of Nurses officials to call off the strike and give a chance to talks. The strike started on Monday. “My government will initiate the process of issuing promotion letters to all officers who were recently promoted,” he said. Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi, also the acting Health executive, said they have held several meetings with the nurses’ union officials. Busia nurses’ union chairman Isaiah Omondi said they are ready for negotiations. Busia County Referral Hospital medical superintendent Dr David Mukabi said the 32 contracted nurses should be protected to enable them to continue offering services.
