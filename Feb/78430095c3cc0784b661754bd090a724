Masinde Muliro University professors want a new vice chancellor appointed. They want the recruitment process fast-tracked, warning that further delays could ruin learning. Prof Joseph Bosire was appointed in an acting capacity, pending appointment of another boss. But the dons’ chairman Silvery Oteng’i on Wednesday said the institution’s stability is at stake. The VC and DVC positions fell vacant on November 30 last year after the expiry of the terms of Fredrick Otieno and DVCs Igara Kabachi, Josephine Ngaira and Joseph Rotich. The professors read mischief in the delays. They warned against interference and called for strict adherence to leadership guidelines and procedures. “The university has instruments of governance that should be adhered to while carrying out important exercises such as the appointment and recruitment of faculty and management staff,” Prof Frank Matanga said in a statement. “The university Act, the Charter, the MMUST statutes, university policies and regulations provide guidelines on recruitment of the university staff and leadership. Any interference adversely affects the integrity, outcome and the output of the process.” Some Western leaders, including Lurambi MP Titus Khamala, have said they will oppose the appointment of a non-resident to the position. But the professors cautioned the council against allowing nepotism and ethnicity to ruin the process. They said they will support a  leader from any part of the country as long as he or she is of high integrity and can provide positive leadership, forge teamwork and create unity of purpose for the advancement of the university.
