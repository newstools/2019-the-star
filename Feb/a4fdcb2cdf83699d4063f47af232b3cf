Matters religion are sensitive. To some people, they are all about the after life in heaven or hell. Lately, many who claim to have received religious calling believe their heaven is on earth  in terms of flashy four-wheel drives, residence in choice leafy addresses The focus of their preaching is prosperity gospel. After all, a man reapeth where he worketh. They anchor their preaching on panda mbegu. They have registers of the faithful and demand collections and commitment to tithing without fail. Anybody who interferes with this form of preaching is deemed irreligious and condemned as such. Splits in church leadership are frequent and the faithful are often entrapped in ensuing skirmishes. Many a time these incidents have to do with resources and who controls them.        The time to rein in rogue preachers is now. Do their churches file annual returns showing the status of their finances, assets and liabilities?  Do they they declare gifts especially from benefactors of questionable backgrounds? Kangema MP Muturi Kigano has come up with a bill that, if it become law, will address the inadequacies of religious organisations and tame rogue preachers. All stakeholders should be heard to end the charade we have been exposed to over the years.
