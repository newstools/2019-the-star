The ongoing drought has been blamed for increased disputes near water bodies in the county of Nakuru. The Water Resource Authority (WRA) said communities living upstream block rivers, leaving families downstream without water. A week ago the authority announced a water rationing programme within the Lakes Naivasha-Nakuru basin. Under the rationing programme, water from rivers flowing into lakes Naivasha, Nakuru and Gilgil will be regulated. Naivasha subcounty manager Geoffrey Mworia yesterday said, “Farmers upstream, mainly in Gilgil, block rivers leading to the disputes.” Rivers that have dried up include Gilgil, Karati and Njoro, he said. River Malewa, the main source of water for Lake Naivasha, is at its lowest level. “We have been forced to introduce the rationing programme due to the drop in the water levels. The situation has been worsened by some few selfish individuals who block the rivers,” he said. The officer said legal action would be taken against those violating the rationing notice. Mworia also put on notice flower farms that illegally abstract water from Lake Naivasha. Lake Naivasha Water Users Association chairman Enock Kiminta said River Turasha, which was the main tributary for River Malewa, has dried up.
