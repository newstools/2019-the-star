 A contractor was yesterday charged at a Milimani court with impersonating DP William Ruto's wife Rachel and obtaining cash by false pretence. Michael Atito was accused of falsely presenting himself as Rachel by opening a facebook account in her name on January 23, with intent to defraud. The court heard that Atito used the account to solicit money from members of the public. Atito was charged with obtaining Sh7,600 from Truvin Jepkoeach and Sh8,200 from Viola Chepkoech on January 20 and 26, respectively. He allegedly obtained the cash purporting to be in a position to offer each a free motor vehicle. He committed the alleged offence jointly with another suspect who has been charged. DCI officers traced him to his hide out in Kisumu county after complaints were made. Atito and his accomplice duped members of the public that there is an ongoing sensitisation to benefit the poor. They allegedly told members of the public that Rachel is donating lorries to individuals willing to register their names in her facebook account and remitting registration fee to facilitate change of logbooks. Complainants sent money to Atito. He denied the charges before senior principal Martha Mutuku. Mutuku released him on a bond of Sh200, 000 and a cash bail of Sh 100, 000. Hearing of the case starts on March 3.
