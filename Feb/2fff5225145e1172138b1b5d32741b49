Police officers were on Friday forced to separate taxi and matatu operators who clashed over the Tuskys terminus in Meru town. The matatu operators had earlier invaded and occupied the stage which prompted protests by their taxi counterparts. This forced security officers led by Imenti North OCPD Peter Kimani to separate the two groups. The taxi operators accused the county government of denying them a conducive environment to operate their business despite being allocated the spot by former governor Peter Munya. They now claim there is a sinister motive behind the move to have them vacate a stage they have been operating on for years. Some of them have claimed that Governor Kiraitu Murungi wants to chase them away so that he can build kiosks at the stage. "After our last demonstrations, it was agreed taxis should continue operating from here. What has changed? We won't allow this. The governor and OCPD should come up with a permanent solution," Kaimenyi Kinoti, a taxi operator said. However, Kimani insisted despite the turf wars, peace and order must be maintained in the town. The police boss said most taxis have not complied to the traffic rules. "The law must be followed. For those out to create chaos, let them know we are ready for them," Kimani said. Kimani said the decision to remove the taxis was reached at during the Town's Management Board meeting. "They will be operating from another designated area," he said.
