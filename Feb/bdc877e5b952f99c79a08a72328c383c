The 37-year-old Eldoret man who allegedly killed his girlfriend yesterday asked his neighbour to help him dump the body. Aaron Kibyiego said David Siloba sought his help so they could carry the body of 25-year-old Fiona Kisuya to a rubbish pit. “He told me he had killed his wife and wanted help to dump the body,” he said. Kibyiego said he dashed out his house and Siloba tried to force him to enter the house where the body was, but he refused and rushed to report him. Siloba returned from the US last month. Some residents said he was deported over crime and drug abuse. He had lived with his parents.

Eldoret East police boss John Owuoth said Siloba must have strangled Fiona and used a panga to cut her body before moving it to the pit. The body was partly burnt and the officers had a difficult time removing it from the pit. The woman’s throat had been slit and one hand was severed. “The body had deep cuts all over. We’ve taken it to the morgue at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital as we continue with investigations,” Owuoth said. Neighbours said the two fought often, sometimes in public. “They have not had a good relationship because they kept on fighting all over,” one of them said.
