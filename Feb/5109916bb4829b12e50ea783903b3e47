Government has doubled the tax on dividends from saccos to 10 per cent from January 1 this year. In addition, the withholding tax handed over by each sacco to the government has doubled to 10 per cent. So in effect the tax on dividends paid by a sacco member has risen from 10 to 20 per cent. This is after the 30 per cent corporate tax on sacco profits. There are around 5,000 saccos in Kenya with around 4.2 million members. They are the bedrock of the economy. They provide better earnings on deposits and lower borrowing rates than commercial banks. Saccos are a lifeline for millions so they should be subsidised by government. Instead, listed companies in Kenya are treated better than saccos. They do not deduct any withholding tax from dividends. And the tax payable on company dividends is only five per cent. So sacco members pay four times as much tax as shareholders in listed companies. This is not fair and it is not good economics. The Treasury should revert to the status quo for tax on sacco dividends. Quote of the day: "It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men."
