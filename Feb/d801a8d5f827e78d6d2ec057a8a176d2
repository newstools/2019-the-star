Business owners are now resorting to consolidating workspaces, or subletting extra space as they seek efficiency and reduce cost of running business, a report titled (Y)Our Space by Knight Frank has shown. The occupier services trend has also come with co-working spaces where the land lord introduces serviced offices where the tenant will access services such as water and internet plus work desk all for a fixed fee, hence managing leasing costs. “With the many trends shaping up in the office market, Occupier Services consultancy is in high demand, where we advise companies on how best to accommodate their employees in high quality space while boosting productivity and reducing costs,” said Ben Woodhams, the MD. Data in the report shows total occupancy costs for prime office space in Nairobi is approximately $23.76 (Sh2,380) per square foot annually.
