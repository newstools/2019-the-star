Rapper Khaligraph Jones has warned Jalang'o to stop comparing him with local artistes. "That is a competition for local artistes and I am not one of them. My competitors are the likes of Jay Z and other international rappers," Khaligraph told Word Is on Wednesday. This comes after Jalang'o put up a long post on Instagram attacking the rapper for sharing Octopizzo's music, despite them having been beefing for so long. The presenter requested that King Kaka, Octopizzo, Nyashinski and Khaligraph organise a concert. "What are you sharing, the only thing fans want to be shared is a Mic for and Octopizzo, King Kaka and Nyashinski and perform together on stage so we can decide who is the real king..," read part of Jalango's post. But in his defence, Khaligraph said: "The reason I shared Octopizzo music is that as an international artiste, you need to support local talents." Khaligraph and Octopizzo have been beefing for a while now, but Khaligraph says he is not beefing with any artiste, and anyone who wants to share the stage with him can do that. "They have beef with me, but I don't," he said.
