Jamaican reggae star Richie Spice has described Rastafari life as a natural way of life. "It is a way of life as it is, with no interruption. It’s not fashioned but it is just a way of life for peace. The natural me comes out through being a Rastafarian," he told Shaffie on Friday. "We don't want to be mixed." Richie has dreadlocks but his four children don’t. He says it’s their choice, adding that according to their culture, followers are required to remain natural. "This is because they chose to be in that form but their hair is all natural. No chemical in their hair." As many Kenyans adopt the culture of keeping dreadlocks, deep-rooted Rastafarian Richie Spice broke down what it means to be one. He said the culture is strict. "We are against crime. We try to share what we have. We are also careful about what we eat because we are destroying the temple. We eat what is good for human consumption," he said. In as much as they believe Africa is their first and second home, Rastafarians believe that one day they will reside back in their motherland, Ethiopia. "I have never been to Ethiopia and I have never performed there, but I believe we will be united there one day," he said. Richie Spice also commented on the Kibera girl who went to court after being rejected by the school over dreadlocks. This pleased Richie Spice, who was happy because the Education ministry intervened and she was allowed back to class. "It’s good that the court speaks justice, knowing that it’s just a natural vibration. We give thanks that the child is back to school because that is who they are," he said. The father of the Kibera student also met Richie Spice, but it is not clear what they discussed during a press briefing. Richie Spice was in Kenya for the ‘Nobody can stop reggae’ concert, which went down on Saturday at KICC.
