More than 60 countries will use Kenyan flowers for their Valentine’s celebrations, according to Kenya Flower Council. Kenya is the lead exporter of roses to Europe including Netherlands, France, Germany, Norway with a market share of about 38 per cent. Other countries include UAE, Russia, Australia, Saudi Arabia and the US. Approximately 50 per cent of exported flowers are sold through Dutch Auctions in the Netherlands, although direct sales are growing. “Exporters are now making direct sales to the countries and expect to make about the same sale volumes as last year,” KFC chief executive Clement Tulezi said. In 2018, sale of cut flowers was recorded at 15,941 tonnes at the value of Sh12.35 billion in January and 17,501 tonnes in February at the value of Sh12.68 billion. Total earnings from cut flowers increased by 37.8 per cent to Sh113.16 billion last year, from Sh82.24 billion in 2017. Earnings from cut flowers represented 73 per cent of Sh153.68 billion earned from horticulture exports compared to 71 per cent proportion of Sh115.32 billion in 2017. The local market only takes less than 0.5 per cent of the total produce. Emirates SkyCargo will today deploy an additional aircraft to ferry flowers from Nairobi to Sydney, Australia for the first time. The flight will add to the existing flights to the Netherlands. The airline also exported over 2,200 tonnes of flowers in January, and a total of 27,000 tonnes of fresh flowers to Europe and the rest of the world in 2018. “Flower exports reach their peak between September and October but the demand for roses stays consistent throughout the year, with a spike in January and early February, ahead of Valentine’s Day. This often necessitates deploying additional freighters to meet growing demand,” East Africa Emirates cargo manager Saeed Abdulla said. The industry is grappling with lack of VAT refunds estimated at Sh3.5 billion as well as customs documentation and processing, the sector report indicates. This has subjected the industry to tight cash flow with growers and exporters forced to borrow loans to sustain their operations.
