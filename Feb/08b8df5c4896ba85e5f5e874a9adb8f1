The pain of cane farmers is pulpable - they have not been paid their Sh2.6 billion arrears as promised by President Uhuru Kenyatta last October. Their children are at home due to lack of school fees. The President, on Mashujaa Day, directed that the farmers be paid their arrears in full. On Thursday, farmers from Webuye said the delay had left them destitute. They had supplied cane to Nzoia Sugar Factory. At a press conference in Webuye town, the growers said they were unable to take their children for lack of fees. “We’re even unable to plough our farms ahead of the planting season. We are so poor that we can’t even afford basic needs,” Brichon Barasa said. As a follow-up to the President’s directive, Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri said the farmers would be paid before the end of December. “We are wondering why we have not been paid yet we’re suffering. Something must be done urgently,” Barasa said. Area MP Dan Wanyama told farmers that the government was urgently looking into the matter. The farmers asked Uhuru to intervene. “I haven’t been able to take my two sons to school because of fee arrears. I can’t pay because I’m yet to get my dues,” Barasa said. The farmers accused former sugar board chairman Saul Busolo of forming a parallel task force from that directed by Kiunjuri to look into the issues bedeviling the sector. They said such a move will ruin efforts to revive the industry. Barasa said they were against calls to do away with the zoning of farmers. “Lack of zoning has been the greatest challenge in this sector and anyone opposed to zoning is an enemy of farmers.” He said it was baffling that Busolo opposed zoning “having strongly championed it when he was the sugar board chairman”. Bungoma county commissioner Stephen Kihara said the government was working to resolve the delay. Last week Bungoma leaders led by Senator Moses Wetang’ula threatened to lead farmers in protests against the President if the delay persists.
