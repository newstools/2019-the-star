The High Court in Kajiado yesterday ordered the National Land Commission to pay Clarence Matheny Leadership Training Institute Sh787 million in land compensation. Justice Reuben Nyakundi said the money accrued from compulsory acquisition of the land in Ngong by the NLC for construction of SGR phase 2A. Bishop Joel Chola, the executive director of the organisation that own Ngong/Ngong/15559, went to court after NLC bosses led by chairman Muhammad Swazuri allegedly delayed the compensation process. “I order that the NLC pays Sh787,987,569 to Clarence Matheny Leadership Training Institute not later than this week on Thursday,” Justice Nyakundi ruled. Swazuri and commission’s lawyers were present in court. Chola said justice has been served. According to court documents, the organisation was informed of the compulsory acquisition of the land on November 10, 2017, by the Kenya Railways and later by the NLC in a letter on January 3 last year. A gazette notice was later issued on March 2 last year. The organisation, Chola said, obliged to the compulsory acquisition of land and promised to support the project. They were formally requested on January 3 last year to allow the Chinese construction company build pillars on their property. Chola said his institution filed a formal compensation application in February last year. Click here for the latest political news
