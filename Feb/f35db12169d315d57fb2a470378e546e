Police put pepper in the private parts of a suspect in the murder of businesswoman Mary Wambui, a court heard yesterday. Judy Wangui said the officers wanted to compel her to change her earlier statement. Wangui, through lawyer Cliff Ombeta, told Kiambu Senior Principal Magistrate Stella Atambo that she was tortured at Juja police station. She said two policewomen assaulted her on Friday night. The court heard that the suspect has marks on her thighs and the upper part of her body. Atambo ordered a report on the assault allegations to be submitted in the next mention date.

The prosecution told the magistrate the investigation is complex hence the need for more time. But defence lawyers opposed the application, saying nothing is being done by police. The suspects are Wangui, Joseph Kori and Michael Mathenge, who admitted to having helped to transport Wambui’s body to a dam in Juja. The court further ordered for an inventory of the items collected from Kori - the deceased’s husband – to be filed in court. Kori, 41, cried uncontrollably in court. He tried to control his tears. Kori was doing fine until his lawyer started presenting his case. He took out a white handkerchief and wiped his tears. Wambui disappeared on January 26 and her body was found the following day at Courtesy Beach in Juja. In a video that went viral days after her brutal murder, Wambui, 39, reminds people that challenges never last forever.
