The Star has just published a long article on the need to write a will. www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019/02/26/battles-for-ailing-parents-properties-show-the-need-to-write-living_c1893105. Many people, especially men, do not write wills and create chaos when they die. Relatives appear to evict the wife and seize property. Or the deceased's estate is fought over in court for decades, losing value every day. It is so obviously sensible to make a will yet so many people fail to do so. Perhaps it is superstition, perhaps it is laziness, but the main reason is probably that people don't like to think about death, especially as they get older. When John Keen died in 2016, his will stipulated that any relatives would automatically be disinherited if they challenged his will. That is a bit extreme but at least it ensured that his estate was shared out according to his wishes. So if you have not made a will, go and see a lawyer today. It is not that expensive and it will save your family a lot of money and heartache. Quote of the day: "Nobody has more cousins than a cheating girlfriend."
