Police were yesterday allowed to detain, for seven days, five people accused of hurling a hand grenade at officers in Mathare. Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga directed that Collins Oduor, Moses Okiri, Kelvin Onyango, Maricus Ouma and Samwel Njeri be held at Muthaiga police station. The suspects are also accused of firing at police. The prosecution said they were arrested on Monday at 8pm after police overpowered them. Other suspects escaped. Constable Reagan Munga said police were on normal patrol duties at Stage 29/30 in Mathare North when they were approached by three motor cycles which had three passengers each. The officers followed the suspects before they hurled a grenade at the police. The grenade did not explode. The suspects then fired at the officers. They had allegedly robbed an M-Pesa shop in the area. The officers arrested the suspects and recovered one motor cycle, five flash disks and three mobile phones. Munga said he needed time to conduct an identification parade and also take conduct forensic analysis on the phones and flash discs. “I need to recover firearms and other accomplices who are still at large. I’ll also liaise with NTSA to get the owner of the recovered motor cycle and take the grenade for ballistic analysis,” Munga said.
