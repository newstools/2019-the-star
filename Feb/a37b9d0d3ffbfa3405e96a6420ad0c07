Marsabit County Government on Saturday issued 150 title deeds to residents of Dub Goba in Saku constituency. Governor Mohamud Ali told residents not to sell their land but rather to use it to develop themselves. He promised to give more titles to other residents, adding that the land issue will no longer be politicised. There were scenes of jubilation at the chief's office when residents were handed the title deeds they had been waitingÂ for since independence. At the same time, the Governor asked the registrar of persons to ensure youths get national identity cards. He said in the last one year, no registration has been done in the county. Ali said the county government is committed to uniting communities and safeguarding peace. He called on security agencies to speed up investigations and arrest those behind the disappearance of two youths along the Moyale- Marsabit road three days ago. Saku MP Dido Ali Raso told residents to apply for electricity connection. He said there should be transparency and accountability in the population and housing census scheduled for August.
