Five blocks at Leopard Beach Resort in Diani were on Sunday night destroyed after fireworks ignited a blaze. Each block had 20 rooms. The management reported no casualties. Kwale county commissioner Karuku Ngumo yesterday said police are investigating the cause of the fire. Katana Karisa, a caretaker at Governors Cottage which neighbours Leopard Beach Resort, said he was cleaning the swimming pool when the fire started in one of the buildings. It spread quickly due to strong winds. Two facilities at the Governors Cottage were also caught fire. “I think there was a wedding at the neighbourhood Leopard Beach Hotel and after the ceremony, they started fireworks, leading to the fire,” he said. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa and a delegation were in the resort. They were evacuated to the neighbouring Almanara Resort. The group’s belongings were destroyed. Ngumo said the hotel management responded fast by moving guests to neighbouring hotels. The administrator said fire fighters arrived promptly. The resort’s resident manager, Joanne Ndung’u, said they are helping the affected guests. She did not talk more to the media. “I’m sorry we are busy sorting out guests since most of them have lost their travelling documents,” she said.
