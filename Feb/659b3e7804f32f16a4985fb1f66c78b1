Five blocks each with 20 rooms were razed down last night at Leopard Beach Resort in Diani, Kwale. Katana Karisa, a caretaker at the resort, said he was cleaning the swimming pool when the fire started in one building before it quickly spread as it was windy. "I think there was a wedding in the neighbourhood. I suspect fireworks started the fire," he said. Kwale County Commissioner Karuku Ngumo said police have launched investigations to establish the cause of the fire. Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, who was at the hotel during the incidence, was evacuated with other guests to the neighbouring Almanara Resort. Ngumo told journalists on Monday that no casualties were reported as the firefighters arrived on time. Leopard Beach Resort resident manager Joanne Ndung'u said she could not talk to the media because they were sorting out guests. "I'm sorry we are busy sorting out guests who were staying at the hotel. Most of them have lost their travelling documents. For now, we cannot talk to the media," she said.
