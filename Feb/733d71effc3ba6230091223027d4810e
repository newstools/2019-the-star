A case in which a police officer is charged with defiling a minor failed to proceed because his lawyer was sick. Constable Laban Njogu is accused of defiling the child in a Murang’a police cell in 2017. His lawyer, Joseph Kirubi, told Murang’a principal magistrate Edwin Muriuki that he was unwell and could not proceed with the hearing. Five witnesses, among them a former deputy OCS at Murang’a police station and an official from the government chemist, have been lined up. Muriuki adjourned the case to June 19. Njogu is out on a bond of Sh400,000. He is accused of defiling the 13-year-old girl who had been locked up for theft. The girl was arrested on September 30, 2017. A witness said Njogu walked into the female cells and started chatting with the minor at night. Nelson Muturi said he had been remanded in the neighbouring male cells. He said the officer’s actions aroused his curiosity, causing him to listen through the door. Power went out for some time before the officer got out of the female cells and threw something on the roof of toilets which are opposite the cells, Muturi said. Muturi said he called out the suspect and asked for a cigarette and was allowed to smoke outside the cells. He then went near the female cells and tried to get information on what had transpired. Muturi said he engaged the minor who said the police officer had sexually assaulted her.
