Mwamba RFC centre Brad Owako has signed for Spanish second division side, Bantierra Fenix. Owako has signed a one-year deal with the Spanish outfit. Owako has been at Mwamba for close to five where he joined from Laiser Hill Academy and has played for Kenya 7’s at Amsterdam 7’s in 2016 under Benjamin Ayimba. He’s been capped twice by the Kenya Simbas. Technical director Alfredo Benedi told the club’s website they are delighted to have Owako. “Brad wants to have a sporting experience above all human outside his country. After many problems with the visas, he now joins us and we know he will add value to the team,” added Benedi. He said Owako will play a key role as they seek promotion to Heineken League, Spain’s top rugby league. Fenix currently lead Group ‘B’ of second division after 18 rounds of the 2018/19 season. The regular season runs through 22 matchdays and upon completion, the two top teams of each group and two-best 3rd placed teams qualify for promotion playoff. “We are on top of the second division and there are four games to go. If everything goes well, we will fight to ascend to the first division and we hope that Brad will help us a lot,” added Benedi Mwamba RFC released a statement wishing Owako all the best in his new club. “We would like to wish Brad the best in his new assignment and we certainly know he will continue flying the Kulabu flag high in his new frontier as he helps Bantierra Fénix in their campaign. All the best BradBoy and see you soon!” Mwamba coach Kevin Wambua said Owako’s decision to play abroad will not hamper their chances of making the playoffs come the end of the season.
