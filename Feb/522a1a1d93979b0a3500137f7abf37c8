Police in Naivasha town (above) have launched investigations after a middle aged woman and her 13-year old daughter were murdered in their home near Sanctuary Farm. Their decomposing bodies were found by neighbours in their locked house after going missing for close to a week. Initial investigations indicated that they were sexually abused by their attackers before they were murdered using a blow to the back of their heads. The teenager was incidentally set to join Form One this week after residents held a harambee to assist her join school. Emotions ran high as police with the help of the public moved in to collect the bodies on Sunday morning before ferrying them to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital mortuary. According to John Kung’u, a neighbour, the family was last seen a week ago before they mysteriously disappeared. Kung’u said that the woman worked in one of the farms in the area adding that neighbors thought the two who lived in a rented house had travelled upcountry. “We were attracted to the scene by a foul smell and the house was locked from the outside forcing us to break in,” he said. They found the decomposing bodies lying on the floor before calling police. “Thought the bodies are in bad condition, it’s evident that the attackers sexually abused them before murdering the duo,” he said tears flowing down his cheeks. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said they were seeking the woman’s boyfriend to record a statement over the incident. He said the suspect who had since gone into hiding was last seen leaving the house before the bodies were found a week later. Meanwhile, child activists in Gilgil have rescued a 12-year old  who had been forcefully married to a 30-year old man. The irate women raided the home of the suspect in Soysambu and frog-matched him to Gilgil police station.
