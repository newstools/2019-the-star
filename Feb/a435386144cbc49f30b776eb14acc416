AU envoy Raila Odinga on Monday held talks with the UK High Commissioner to Kenya Nic Hailey at his Capitol Hill office. The two discussed the Building Bridges Initiative, war on corruption and the UK’s support for Kenya’s economy through private sector investments and political developments in the region. Hailey appreciated the good working relationship between Raila and President Uhuru Kenyatta. "Held talks with the British High Commissioner to Kenya @HCNicHailey who expressed their appreciation of the working relationship between myself and President @UKenyatta, which has stabilised the country," Raila tweeted On January 25, Uhuru's Jubilee Party said it will not present a memorandum to the Building Bridges team. The party instead asked its members to individually share their opinions with the Wajir Senator Yusuf Haji-led committee. Whereas President Uhuru had intimated that a referendum will be inevitable, Deputy President William Ruto's allies have opposed the proposal. The President, during Jamhuri Day celebrations last year, said the country must rethink its current executive structure 'where the winner takes it all'. On January 20, Ruto called on church leaders to support the Building Bridges Initiative. The DP said the unity efforts started in 2013 and the initiative was key to uniting Kenyans.
