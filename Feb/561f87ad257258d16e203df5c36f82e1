Hundreds of women in Malindi on Friday marked the world 1 billion movement to advocate against gender-based violence, sexual harassment and female genital mutilation. The women including school children wore red and black ribbons and T-shirts branded ‘1 billion rising for quality love, and one billion love for equality’. The event was held at the Bar centre. In Africa, the movement that was launched worldwide in 2015 is celebrated in Kenya and Uganda. Rita Valentini, an Italian woman right activist led the festivals. She said she aims at bringing on board thousands of women and men in the campaign to end violence against girls and women. “1 Billion Rising is an important celebration marked every year worldwide, the mission is to reach 1 billion membership, in Malindi it's becoming bigger,’’ she said. Velentini said most of the victims of violence were from poverty-stricken families and normally live with the problem fearing to come out to speak about it. Among the children who participated in the movement were orphans from Imani Children’s home. Click here for the latest political news
