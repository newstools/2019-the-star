Two police officers will be charged next week on Tuesday with the murder of a 17-year-old boy in Kilifi in June 2018. A warrant of arrest has already been issued against the two; Simeon Oyoo Ayodo and Amos Kiptoo Kipsang. They are accused of shooting dead Katana Kazungu in Mariakani, Kaloleni. They will be arraigned in Malindi. The office of the Director of Public Prosecution in Malindi has confirmed the arrest orders. The deceased was a class-seven pupil at Ndatani Primary School. Ayodo and Kipsang were trailing a truck when they aimlessly opened fire. Muslims for Human Rights is handling the case. The rights group said Kazungu had returned from a funeral when he was called by friends to help push a truck that was stuck. There was a heavy downpour. The truck was transporting stones from a nearby quarry. Independent Policing Oversight Authority launched an investigation that took seven months. After the killing, the two officers were suspended. There was pressure from the police department and some local administrators to bury the victim's body without a postmortem examination. An autopsy was done at Coast Level Five Hospital on July 3. The report revealed Kazungu was shot at close range from the back. It was witnessed by IPOA, Independent Medico-Legal Unit and officers from Mariakani Police. Kaloleni MP Paul Katana said those involved in the murder must be punished. MUHURI said lives must be respected. The family of Kazungu is optimistic that justice will be served.
