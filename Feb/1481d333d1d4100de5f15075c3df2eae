Sabo Kalsii leads the first batch of six qualifiers ahead of the KCB Masters Pro-Am event slated for June 25-26 in Karen after shinning during the first leg of KCB “Road to the Masters at Sigona over the weekend. Playing off handicap 20, the home golfer shot an impressive 41 points made up of 21 points in the first nine and 20 in the back nine, to beat a huge field of 204 players. On his way up, Kalsi sank in two birdies on holes 2 and 10, parred holes 9 and 17 and bogeyed the rest. “I bogeyed a number of holes but the few pars and birdies I made really helped me. I am honoured to have qualified to take part at the Pro-Am tournament. Thanks to the Masters Series for giving an opportunity to play alongside top Kenyan professional golfers,” said Sabo Other qualifiers from Sigona were men’s winner Ishwar Aldasani (H24), guest winner Lee Mungai (H22), staff winner Ogola Azu (H26) and lady winner Milka Mburu playing off handicap 26. The sixth qualifier from the Club was Jolly Esmail who becomes the first player in this year’s series to win the wildcard. The wildcard slot was decided from a lucky dip conducted on all the score cards returned by the playing field. The KCB Karen Masters will be held after the two Pro-Ams from on June 27-30. The next round of the Road to the Masters heads the Nyali Golf and Country Club on March 30. The Nyali tour will feature professional players who will compete for a prize fund of Sh2million for the next four legs.
