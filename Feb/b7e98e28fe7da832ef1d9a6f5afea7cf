Tanzanian singer and songwriter Nandy has denied having a relationship with Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho. "All this was because I wore a cap and even used a chopper written 001 in my new video," Nandy told Word Is on Monday. The 'Ninogeshe' hitmaker however promised to be working more with the governor. "He is a person who loves bongo music and he loves Tanzanian artistes, and so we are there to support him as he supports us," she said. "Just because I am a woman, they will say I am dating him." Nandy said Joho supported her video shooting in Mombasa. "I am even looking for a way I will get a house in Kenya so I can relocate here as well," she said.
