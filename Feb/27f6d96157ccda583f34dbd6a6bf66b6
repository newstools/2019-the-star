Crime in Karanjee village in Limuru constituency is expected to decline as boda operators partner with Nyumba Kumi officials. The officials arrived at an agreement not to allow unknown motorcylists to operate. Limuru boda boda chairman Paul Mugo said they agreed that operators without a displayed sacco number, either at the front or at the back, will be questioned. “We also will go to outskirts like Karanjee, Manguo, Kwambira, Tigoni and Tarambana but if you are going to Karanjee, be ready to be questioned,” he said. Mugo said operators who do not belong to any of their known groups will be intercepted and taken to an AP camp for interrogation. Karanjee resident Marion Nduta said they have welcome the move. “One would be robbed even during the day. The thieves would even call you by your name asking you to relax as they rob you, but the partnership between the AP’s, Nyumba Kumi, residents and boda boda operators has brought crime down,” she said. Deputy county commissioner David Kiprop praised the partnership, saying though motorcycles have provided employment for many, they have been abused by people with ill motives. Mugo has urged public service motorcyclists in the area to register themselves with saccos to avoid getting into trouble with law enforcers. “We are also looking forward to spread the whole concept in the whole subcounty since the motorcycle groups are being turned into saccos,” he added.
