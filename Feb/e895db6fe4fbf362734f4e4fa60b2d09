A conservation group in Taita-Taveta has launched annual rural cultural extravaganzas that include traditional dances and music as tools for combating extremism amongst youth in areas with high unemployment rates. Management of Arid Zones in Development Options (MAZIDO) started Bughuta Cultural Extravaganza as a platform to counter radicalisation among youth in over 20 villages in Kasighau Ward in Voi sub-county. The project is funded by USAID and involves the promotion of traditional dances and music to foster communal values in rural areas. Speaking in Bughuta during a cultural dance competition, the group’s Executive Director John Mlamba said cultural events played a major role in instilling good morals and values in a society. “Music and dance are powerful tools to counter radicalisation and discourage youth from joining outlawed groups,” he said. He added that rural areas with high unemployment rate were becoming rich hunting grounds for radicals with jobless youths becoming soft targets. The event featured dances from various communities including Giriama, Duruma, Taita and Watha.
