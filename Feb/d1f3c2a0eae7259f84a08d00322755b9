Good Morning. MPs trooped back to Parliament on Tuesday ready for business which includes putting in place a mechanism to audit the Auditor-General. Parliament has now ordered the direct sourcing of an auditor to scrutinise the accounts of the Office of the Auditor General with three previous attempts failing after committees cited conflict of interest in the applicants. Here are the other stories making headlines in the Star this Wednesday morning. I am not sidelined, Matiang'i reports to me - Ruto Deputy President William Ruto has rubbished claims that President Uhuru Kenyatta has elbowed him out of the heart of power to obstruct his 2022 presidential bid. For the first time, Ruto dismissed claims that Uhuru’s reorganisation of the executive, placing Interior CS Fred Matinag’I at the helm was meant to diminish him. The DP maintained that he and Uhuru planned the reorganisation together and categorically state that Matiang’i reports to him (Ruto). _____________________________________________________ Schools crisis as government fails to fund all students Secondary schools principals have warned over possible financial crisis after allegations that state funding on education failed to cater for all students. A move by the ministry to provide capitation to learners only captured on NEMIS could now be subject to controversy as principals allege close to half a million learners were unfunded threatening to affect service delivery in the institutions. _____________________________________________________ Jubilee disowns Kuria's de-whipping plot Ruling Jubilee party has disowned de-whipping claims of Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria from House committees. Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju and National Assembly majority whip Benjamin Washiali yesterday told the Star that the ruling party has no plans to remove anyone from the Committees. On Monday , Kuria hit at National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale for allegedly plotting to have him dewhipped from two committees of the House. _____________________________________________________ Counties to hire more workers to support UHC workload Four counties have been allowed to hire additional health workers to handle the universal health coverage pilot. The ministry of health said health facilities in Kisumu, Nyeri, Machakos and Isiolo are heavily constrained because patients have increased by up to 40 per cent. “In response, some of the counties have recruited additional personnel, while others are at various stages of recruitment. The additional staff will be catered for from the allocations to the health budget,” Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki said. _____________________________________________________ Lake Naivasha terrain under threat in boundary review Lake Naivasha will lose more than 100,000 acres if the government proceeds with a contentious plan to redraw its boundaries. The proposed move, which has been condemned by conservation lobbies and the National Environment Management Authority, significantly reduces the riparian land all around the lake. The Water Resources Authority quietly redrew the lake's boundaries late last year, but the new order has not been gazetted. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
