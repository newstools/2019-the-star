Alex Obanda’s 79 off 40 balls steered Swamibapa’s successful chase as they beat Cutchi Leva by eight wickets in the Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) Twenty20 tournament. Chasing 133 to register their sixth win of the 2018 campaign, Swamibapa needed only 12.2 overs to seal off the match and maintain their unbeaten run. The national team opening batsman sealed victory for his side after a poor start to their chase that saw his opening partner back to the pavilion in the second over. He took his side from 15-4 to 118 for 2 in an incredible century second wicket stand with Naman Patel (36). Obanda’s half ton consisted of six boundaries and same number of sixes. Their long stand that lasted only nine overs was brought to an end by Harshi Varsani who bowled Patel. Swamibapa’s low target came after Cutchi Leva had blown away their good start that had seen them on 81 for 3 with eight overs to go. Niraj Patel (49) and Ravi Rabadia (38) were in full control of Cutchi Leva’s inning and were set to get their side to a respectable total until James Ngoche struck with the dismissal of Niraj. From here, the hosts lost wickets regularly before finally finishing on 133 for 8. Emmanuel Bundi, Jadavji Bhimji and Ngoche all took two wickets each. In other match, opener Chandresh Hirani’s half ton led Ruaraka Sports Club to an easy nine-wicket win over Kongonis at Ruaraka.  Hirani and Hitesh Varsani put on a match-winning unbeaten second wicket stand of 70 runs to seal the win for the home team in 14.2 overs in pursuit for 110.
