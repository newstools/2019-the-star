Five parents have been arraigned in Eldoret for failing to take their children to Form One. The five from Likuyani sub county in Kakamega were charged before Senior Resident Magistrate Christine Menya. They were charged with infringement of the right of children to education contrary to section 7 (1) of children act of 2011. Stephen Ondia, Grace Munuko, Emily Andisi, Grace Nanjala and Francis Khisa pleaded guilty saying they did not have money to take the children to school. “It's due to poverty and lack of fees that I can’t take my child to school. There is no joy for me to stay with my daughter at home when she is supposed to be in school your honour," said one of the parents. They were accused that on diverse dates between January 3 and February 16 in Sango village, Kakamega county, infringed the rights of their children by failing to take them to school.
