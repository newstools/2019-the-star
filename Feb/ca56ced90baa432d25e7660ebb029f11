Former Laisamis MP Joseph Lekuton on Friday lost a bid to block the media from publishing stories on a defamation suit against him. Marsabit nominated MCA Zamzam Arigele has sued the former lawmaker for calling her a prostitute. Lekuton’s lawyer Julius Njoroge told Meru High Court Judge Alfred Mabeya that the matter was being discussed on social media and was having a negative impact on the proceedings. “I decline to issue orders to gag the media from proceedings because the defendant has not demonstrated any story on social or mainstream media that has affected the case,’’ Mabeya said. Arigele, through lawyer Anyegah Ondieki, had opposed Lekuton’s bid, saying he had not demonstrated how or where the media had infringed on his rights. The second-term MCA sued after Lekuton allegedly committed the offence on May 16, 2015 at a public function officiated by then Governor Ukur Yattani. Senator Abubakar Hargura, Deputy Governor Omar Ali Abdi and several MCAs attended the function. The MCA is demanding an apology and wants the court to compel Lekuton to defray the suit costs and also pay for general and exemplary damages. Two witnesses Amina Mohammed and Ntaramatwa Orbora said it was Arigele who had called Lekuton a prostitute A former Laisamis police station boss is expected to testify on May 14. Arigele said Lekuton insulted her while she was preparing a group of women to present gifts to the guests. “The insults disparaged my character and strained my relationship with my husband for a while,” Arigele said.
