Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti's election has been upheld by the Supreme Court. "The appellant courts decision is set aside in its eternity. The election of Homa Bay county will stand as the valid position as stated by the IEBC," Judge Jackson Ojwang said. There was Jubilation after the Supreme court judge read the verdict with whistles and praises heard outside the court premises in Nairobi on Thursday. Awiti's win was challenged by independent candidate Oyugi Magwanga, who was Awiti's main challenger in the 2017 election. The governor had moved to the Supreme court after the Court of Appeal's decision to uphold the High court's ruling which nullified his win. The High Court ruled that the IEBC did not conduct a free and fair election in Homa Bay. According to IEBC's disputed results, Awiti got 210,173 votes while Magwanga came second with 189,060 votes.
