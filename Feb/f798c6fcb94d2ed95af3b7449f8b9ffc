Wiper yesterday denied reports that a rebellion is brewing in the party and in Ukambani. The party’s executive council said the grassroots support and the turnout during the Kamba Leaders Convention called Koma 2 Declaration showed a united organisation. Koma 2 was held last Friday. “We solved the issue during the Koma 2 dialogue and we can’t even think of a rebellion,” Wiper council member and former High Commissioner to Tanzania Chirau Mwakwere said. The council spoke at the party headquarters after deliberating on the declarations of Koma two. I ‘m not only a watermelon but Uncle Steve, uncle of all youths across the country going forward,” Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka said during the Koma 2 meeting.
