Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has issued a matatu directive aimed at decongesting the CBD. Director of parking Tom Tinega announced City Hall has suspended with immediate effect all illegal picking and drop off points for commuters within the CBD. In a notice on Saturday, Sonko said rogue matatus found culpable of the offense of picking up and dropping commuters in undesignated areas will be suspended. He said the move comes amid public outcry. Sonko said some drivers have resorted "carelessly pick and drop passengers at any place". “It has come to the attention of the City County that illegal matatu pick-up and drop-off points have been created in areas not gazetted  and especially within the CBD as per the law,” read the statement. “This is to inform you that only gazetted drop off points would be allowed and all non-gazetted drop off points have been suspended with immediate effect." Tinega said, “Streets like Tom Mboya and parts of Moi Avenue have been highlighted to have illegal drop off and pick up points. This has caused unnecessary traffic and also commuters get confused on where they are to board the PSVs." He said some drop off points have been illegally allocated and some operate by protection of cartels. The first Gazette notice on pick up and drop off points within the CBD was published in May 2000 and the second one in May 2017. “The matatus should adhere to the law and use the gazetted points. We want them to operate in an orderly and legal way,” Tinega said. Tinega said City Hall will impound matatus which flout the rule and their saccos risk being suspended.
