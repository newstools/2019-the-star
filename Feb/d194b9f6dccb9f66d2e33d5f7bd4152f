The National Transport and Safety Authority has warned PSV operators against tampering with speed governors. NTSA’s director for road safety Njeri Waithaka told the Star on Friday that most PSVs violate the speed limit. “There is a reason there is a speed limit of 80. But most matatu crew are violating that speed limit by tampering with the speed governor,” Njeri explained. The authority also cautioned PSVs not to overtake at night as the risk is higher at that time. “Don’t overtake when you can’t clearly see, at a bend or when the line is solid and is clearly telling you not to overtake,” she said. PSV operators have also been advised to prioritise safety and discipline on the roads. “When accidents happen, lives are lost while others survive with life-changing injuries,” the official said. improvement on roads The authority has recorded a reduction in road fatalities in its latest statistics.
