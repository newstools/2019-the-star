Bidco United coach Japheth Akhulia has blamed his shaky defence for the team’s 3-2 loss to Kisumu All Stars at Moi Stadium, Kisumu yesterday. Akhulia regretted that the team has only kept two clean sheets in the league so far. “We are scoring goals at the same time conceding. We shall work on this defence ahead of our next game against Coast Stima. We cannot go on like this,” said Akhulia. He also said the artificial turf, coupled with the heat in Kisumu affected his players “They are not used to playing in such conditions but it’s not an excuse,” he added. Shadrack Omondi had given the hosts the lead after 23 minutes but Sean Oporwa pulled Bidco level from the penalty spot after skipper Bobby Kwaka handled the ball in the box in the 26th minute. Dismas Amunga restored All Stars’ lead in the 37th minute from a free kick before Michael Owino equalised for Bidco in the 65th minute. Oduor introduced Austine Otieno late on and the move proved crucial as he netted the winner with 10 minutes to go. At camp Toyoyo, Eric Kinuthia scored a brace (ninth and 58th minutes) and Benjamin Chaka added a third (64th minute) as Nairobi Stima overcame St Joseph 3-1. Adam Fadhili netted the visitors consolation in the 49th minute. Modern Coast beat Shabana 1-0 courtesy of Rashid Benjamin’s 74th minute strike while Stephen Onyango netted a brace as Kibera Black Stars overcame Fortune Sacco 2-1. Jessy Ngei netted Fortune’s consolation.
