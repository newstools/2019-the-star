The time to praise President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga’s handshake is over, an MP has said. Bumula lawmaker Moses Mabonga said it was regrettable that some politicians are still applauding the handshake at the expense of championing development in their constituencies. The legislator made the remarks when he met parents and education stakeholders during the official opening of three classrooms at Mundaa Primary School in his backyard. “A year on after the handshake, the focus must be shifted to other important issues, including the Big Four agenda,” he told journalists.

On the Big Four, he asked the President to gauge resources availability. “And if the resources aren’t sufficient, two pointers in the agenda should be scraped off,” the MP said. On succession, the lawmaker asked Uhuru to retire honourably after completing his current term adding that those vouching for him to extend are misguided. “All elective posts should be pegged to 10 years, which is enough to execute development projects for any visionary leader in office,” the MP said. Mabonga said a referendum, which would usher a change in government structure if successful, should only be backed if it is for the benefit of ordinary citizens.
