Good Morning. President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Jubilee administration intend to sink a further Sh8.4 billion into the controversial laptop project that has so far gobbled in excess of Sh50 billion. The details emerged months after Auditor General Edward Ouko revealed the state could not account for Sh15.2 billion that had been pumped into the project. Here are the other stories making headlines in the Star this Saturday morning. Ruto expands team, plans to quit in 2029 Deputy President William Ruto has expanded his team of advisers to include political heavyweights as he announced that he would like to serve one seven-year term if he is elected in 2022. And the advice from his team is also to craft a kinder, gentler Ruto, support the Big Four and hold fewer harambees where cash is dished out. Ruto also has supported a proposal that the Constitution be changed to provide that the head of state serves only one seven-year term. _____________________________________________________ Why Rutophobia is at the heart of the call for Constitutional changes In Kenya’s schizophrenic politics, it is sometimes difficult to find meaning in every word or action of the politicos. Like the narcos of yonder, the politicos of Kenya can be extremely wily, guileful even rancorous. And absurd. We are in the middle of what could turn out to be an acrimonious drive to change the Constitution. The politicos cannot tell us exactly why we need a constitutional change. Worse still, they cannot seem to agree on which part of the Constitution should be changed. Increasingly, however, it is becoming more about Ruto the person. _____________________________________________________ Referendum push plot by politicians to remain relevant, influential The fight for positions in post-President Uhuru Kenyatta government has intensified, with politicians pushing for a referendum to expand the Executive. Pundits, politicians and civil society groups say the referendum push is part of the wider scheme for top politicians to remain relevant post-2022, and to have an influence in the next government. “A nation of contradictions! We applaud plans to amend the Constitution to accommodate presidential election losers in the Executive but fight the appointment of other election losers to state corporations,” former Mandera Senator Billow Kerrow said. “Being penny wise and pound foolish, to say the least.” _____________________________________________________ Constitution did not intend the President to make law like 14th century monarch Once upon a time, in a country far away and long ago, the King (occasionally Queen) could refuse to sign (called vetoing) new laws passed by Parliament. The power of the monarch to make law waxed and waned over the centuries, as first the monarchy established its dominance over the people, displacing the people as lawmakers, then the power of the monarch waned as Parliament became more powerful and assertive. Our President recently sent back five Bills about health issues. From media reports, his reservations mostly seem to be about drafting issues. We must ask, why is somebody not following the debates in Parliament and ensuring the law passed makes sense? _____________________________________________________ Confession video in Willie Kimani murder put on hold yet again The confession testimony of one of the accused persons in the murder of slain human rights lawyer Willie Kimani was for the second day put on hold by the court. This is after the defence objected for the second day running claiming that they needed time to consult their clients because the confession tape was provided yesterday morning. In the case, four APs including Fredrick Leliman, Stephen Cheburet, Sylvia Wanjiku, Leonard Mwangi and police informer Peter Ngugi, have denied murdering human rights lawyer Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
