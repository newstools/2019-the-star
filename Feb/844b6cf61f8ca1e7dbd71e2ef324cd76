The Kenya Film School will increase its intake to 45 next year from the current 30. The school is a government talent-based institution aimed at giving an opportunity to talented youths to develop their skills. ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru on Friday said the government will expand the film industry as it plays an important role in employment of youth. “Training in the school does not consider academic qualifications but focuses on industry needs, talent and passion,” he said. Mucheru spoke during the second graduation ceremony of 21 students in Kasarani Stadium. The best graduand will be given a chance to visit Korea with a group of ministry officials as an indication of the government’s commitment to support the industry. Caren Gitare was named the best graduand in video editing. Brian Mwangi was the best in scripting and foundation courses. Chariy Wanja, Stephen Mungai and Annette Wanjiku were awarded as the best in sound production, cinematography and best actress, respectively. “It is time we convinced counties to support the sector, which gives the youth an opportunity to pursue their talent. This will lead to increased enrolment,” he said. He said the school will help preserve Kenyan culture through writing, recording and telling of stories. Mucheru said the recent reporting of the black panther, which was spotted in Laikipia, is a clear indication of the need to tell Kenyan stories from our own perspective. “The world was marvelling at the sighting of the black panther for the first time in 100 years in Laikipia county, but the local communities have lived with it for many years. They even have names in their local dialects but this was not reported or recorded. BBC had to come and tell us it has been spotted after 100 years,” the PS said. Present during the graduation was PS Jerome Ochieng and Fatuma Hirsi. Click here for the latest political news
