Three martial arts athletes will represent Kenya at the 2019 Africa Tae Kwon Do Championships set for February 20 in Cairo, Egypt. Emmanuel Karisa (under 61kg), Peter Kabane and Samson Ojuk both competing in the under 75kg category, will don the national colours in Cairo next week. “The teams are all psyched up for the upcoming games and we are confident the event will give them the much needed exposure,” said coach Philip Khaemba who also doubles up as KTF second vice chairman. The three are part of a team of eight who were handed over the National Olympic Committee of Kenya yesterday in Nairobi ahead of their qualification for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The team is comprised of four men and an equal number of women. This is the same team which will compete at the Africa National Olympic Committees Association Zone V games in April in Rwanda, World Championships in Manchester, in England in May and at the All Africa Games set for Rabat, Morocco between August 23 and September 3. While receiving the team, Nock president Paul Tergat lauded KTF and advised other federations to borrow a leaf from the Tae Kwon Do leadership. He said KTF’s leadership turnaround from wrangles and factions to one which speaks with one voice. “I applaud the sense of maturity, unity and togetherness displayed by KTF. Long gone are the days of wrangles, division and poor leadership. Good management is key to the success in any sport,” said Tergat. The Nock supremo said his target of having unity in federations will soon bear fruits. “We are here for the benefit for of sports. I want to ask all federations and associations to put their houses in order and ensure the best athletes are selected to represent Kenya. Merit has to come first,” he added. Meanwhile Nock will be meeting various federation chiefs and their financial officers to consolidate budgets as the qualification and preparation for the Tokyo Olympics beckons.
