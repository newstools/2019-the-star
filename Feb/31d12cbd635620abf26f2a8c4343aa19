Former Chief Government Pathologist Moses Njue says family wrangles are behind claims that he stole the heart of a dead person. Njue has denied charges that on March 12, 2015, at Consolata Hospital in Meru during a postmortem on Benedick Karau, he stole the heart of the deceased. He is out on bail. Njue’s lawyer John Abwuour while cross examining one of the witnesses argued wrangles in the family of Karau were at the root cause of the case. The body was exhumed on August 10, 2015 and a second postmortem conducted on August 18, 2015 in the presence of Njue, chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor, Prof Peter Kiama and Dr Scolastica Kimani. Lawyer Abwuour questioned Karau’s son Peter Kaume on why the second family did not involve other family members in all of the events that transpired after the death of their father. The family of Karau’s second wife Christine Kanario took charge of everything after his death. Kaume said there was deliberations done on phone and the family of his father’s three wives was in agreement But Abwuour was not convinced of the need for a second postmortem whereas the first postmortem samples were presented to the Government Chemist. Kaume said there was mistrust in the families of his father’s three wives. Click here for the latest political news
