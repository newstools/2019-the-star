A body has been found in the wreckage of the plane carrying missing footballer Emiliano Sala. The wreckage of the plane was located by an underwater search team and the families have been told. The AAIB made a short statement on Monday with the recovery operation likely to begin on Tuesday due to bad weather. A short statement confirmed a body 'was visible amidst the wreckage.' Sala and pilot David Ibbotson, were the only two on board the plane. The pair were travelling on a Piper Malibu light aircraft from Nantes to Cardiff when it disappeared over the Channel almost two weeks ago. The initial search was stopped by Guernsey Police after four days, insisting the chances of survival were "very slim". David Mearns decided to lead the private search after seeing a plea from Emiliano Sala’s sister. Romina appeared in front of the press, begging for rescuers to continue looking for her brother.
