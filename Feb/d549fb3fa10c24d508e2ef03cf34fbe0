Lurambi MP Titus Khamala has asked political brokers to stop intimidating him and instead let him to serve the electorate. Khamala said he would rather be a one-term MP and leave a legacy than succumb to intimidation by “brokers out to pursue personal interests”. He said his detractors were trying to intimidate him through social media and “hold me ransom”. “I am not the first Lurambi MP but the twelveth, and I will go just like others have but I would rather serve one term and leave rather than be a puppet of some political brokers.” . Except for the late Newton Kulundu, who served two terms between 1997 and 2007, Lurambi voters change MPs in every election. Social media has been awash with accusations against the MP in the recent past, with some accusing him of employing relatives in the constituency office. On Monday, Khamala trended on the Lurambi Monitors WhatsApp group over accusations that he had verbally dismissed all staff of the National Government Constituency Development Fund from his Eshisiru office. But yesterday, he denied sacking his staff, saying salaries for the Parliamentary Service Commission employees don’t come through the MP.
