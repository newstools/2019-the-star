Kenya Defence Forces basketball outfit Ulinzi Warriors have been bolstered with the return of Byron Mabonga ahead of the 2019 Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) Premier League season. The bigman returned to the team after a one year absence, owing to official military duties. Stephen Bartilol, Warriors’ team manager, said his return will boost their campaign to recapture the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) men’s premier league title, win the Zone V club 2019 gong in October and lift the East Africa Military Games trophy as hosts in September. However, in what looks like a trade in, Mabonga’s return has been met with another blow as a fellow bigman Joseph Owino has exited to  attend a career progression programme for six months. Meanwhile, Warriors have acquired the services of shooting guard Stephane Simiyu who has graduated from KDF second string side Morans.  The guard is also a very good three-man weave player. “Mabonga’s inclusion in the team is a big boost to our campaigns this year, especially our bid to win the East Africa Military Games as the host nation,” said Bartilol. “As league playoffs losing finalists, we will build up from where we left and also count on the energy and gusto they (Mabonga and Simiyu) will inject in our stable.” He added that currently, the team under the tutelage of coach William Balozi is shaping up ahead of the premiership set to commence on March 16.
