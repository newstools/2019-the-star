Nurses yesterday ruled out talks with the Ministry of Labour even as their strike entered its second day. The healthcare workers have kept away from duty across 11 counties. "As a union, we're not going to engage in further talks on issues touching on nursing service allowance and uniform allowance," Kenya National Union of Nurses secretary general Seth Panyako said. He spoke at a press conference in Nairobi. Panyako said negotiation is done at national level and implementation by specific employers (counties). He said the Council of Governors approved their strike notice. The nurses are on strike in West Pokot, Kisumu, Nairobi, Kisii, Taita Taveta, Trans Nzoia, Nyandarua, Nyeri, Wajir, Elgeyo Marakwet and Kitui cunties. They are demanding an increase of Sh5,000 in uniform allowance, Sh3,000 in nursing service allowance and promotion for those who have been in the same job group for more than 10 years. "I don't understand why someone is telling us to go and meet in Nairobi in NSSF building to discuss issues beyond their powers," Panyako said. He said Labour CS Ukur Yatani had enough time to ask for talks after the union issued a strike notice. He said nurses support President Uhuru Kenyatta Universal Health Care. "We are willing and ready to engage with the ministry and representatives from the two arms of government but only to discuss the completion of CBA, grading structure and harmonisation of salaries of our members," he said. "That will only happen when there is an effort by the government to find a lasting solution to the problem of human resource management in the health sector."
