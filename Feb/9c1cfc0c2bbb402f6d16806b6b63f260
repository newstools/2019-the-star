Kenya has denied that some of its recently appointed ambassadors have been rejected by host countries. Foreign Affairs PS Macharia Kamau said reports that some six ambassadors have been rejected due to integrity issues are untrue. They are former Sports CS Hassan Wario (Austria), former Air Force commander Samuel Thuita (Israel) and former DCI boss Ndegwa Muhoro (Malaysia). The others are former SRC chairperson Sarah Serem (China), former Sports PS Richard Ekai (Russia) and Former Kasipul-Kabondo MP Paddy Ahenda (Qatar). The six were among the envoys vetted and approved by Parliament. Some had integrity issues. Confusion has arisen in the Executive, with some officers saying the envoys are awaiting the commissioning by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Sources within Parliament had indicated that due to the delays, the National Assembly Committee on Defence and Foreign Relations had tried to solve the puzzle. But Macharia told the Star yesterday that all the appointees have been deployed. “The current headlines are untrue and incorrect. The appointees have been deployed.” Click here for the latest political news
