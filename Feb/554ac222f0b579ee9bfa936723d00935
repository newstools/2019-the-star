The Mandera government will intensify initiatives meant to support vulnerable and less-privileged residents. They include allocations to projects targeting orphans and the poor. Governor Ali Roba on Saturday said his administration has come up with measures to improve their living standards. He spoke at the Mandera Islamic Centre where he issued grants to orphanages. The county government allocated Sh15 million, a Sh5.5 million increase from last year’s Sh9.5 million. The county chief said the demand had increased. Beneficiaries included Al Hidaya, Al Fauzan, Al Uwais and Al Sunna orphanage centres. “It gives me pleasure to preside over a life-changing initiative to promote quality education and living standards for 815 orphans and vulnerable children,” he said. Allocations will be increased to ensure “no child misses a chance to go to school because they can’t afford education or a place to live.” The county will launch an affordable housing scheme for needy families and a food stocking initiative for the starving residents. Roba urged individuals and private organisations to support the initiatives. It must not be left to the county and national governments alone, he said. “Society is full of people who need our assistance. The county can only do so much. But with the support of well-wishers, we can reach a bigger number and leave a positive impact in their lives,” Roba said. “Our gathering here is a clear demonstration and commitment to supporting orphans and the vulnerable by offering social protection to the needy and deserving. Let’s all support this very noble cause.”
