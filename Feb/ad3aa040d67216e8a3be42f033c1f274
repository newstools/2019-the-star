Athletics Kenya (AK) president Jack Tuwei has warned athletes against age cheating and violating anti-doping rules as the country prepares for an engaging athletics season. Ahead of today’s national cross country championships at the Eldoret Sports Club this afternoon, Tuwei said the two vices have infiltrated the sport and it is time they were put to a conclusive stop. The AK supremo said age cheating and doping has robbed Kenya of good athletes. He revealed that athletes who will be selected to Team Kenya for the world cross country championships on March 30 in Aarhus, Denmark, are expected to sign commitment letters swearing that they will be running clean going forward. “The team that will be selected tomorrow will have to follow the right procedure. Anybody who will be selected to represent the country at the world cross must sign a commitment letter showing that you are going to run clean and if you are found to have doped, that is your problem,” said Tuwei. “You can’t run in junior races for over six years. You are 22 or more but you still compete against an 18 year old runner, are your senses normal?” quipped Tuwei. This comes at a backdrop of two Central Rift runners being banned from competing at the national cross country championships in Eldoret after they were found to have tampered with their documents with an aim of ‘reducing their age’.
