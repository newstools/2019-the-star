Agnes Mwikali risks being thrown out of the Team Kenya to the World Cross Country Championships owing to allegations of age cheating. Mwikali finished fourth in the Under-20 category of the National Cross Country Trials to seal a place in Team Kenya that will feature in the global festival in Denmark. She clocked 20:42.5 behind the podium trio of Beatrice Chebet (29:02.4), Betty Jepkemboi (20:31.2) and Jackline Rotich (20:39.9). However, Star Investigation has revealed that Mwikali had run as a junior under the name Victoria Mwikali in 2013. According to IAAF records, Victoria Mwikali was born on November 12,1996— meaning she is 22 years. She is listed as a 3000m and 5,000m runner. She has a personal best of 9:31.4 minutes in 3,000m run in Nairobi in June 2013 and 16:34.8 in the 12-lap race run in April 2014. Sources hinted that the athletes have lately changed her name in a bid to dodge the system. “This athlete is well over 22 years considering that she featured in the same category in 2012 during Nairobi cross country meet. Assuming that she was 16 or 17 then, it means that she is well over 22 years and therefore can’t feature in the women’s junior cadre,” the source hinted. According to the 2013 reports, Mwikali finished third in the junior category behind Jackline Chepkoech and Betty Chepkemoi during the Nairobi cross country meet. Sources said that her team-mates and those who competed with her in 2013 had raised a red flag and were unsettled with her presence in the junior team. “ Some of the senior athletes who competed with her at the junior level and are now in the senior team have been left with their mouths wide open over her presence in the junior category,” the source noted. The source said the athlete has been juggling with her names to remain relevant considering the competition in the senior category. Reached for comment, Athletics Kenya (AK) youth chairman, Barnabas Korir said they are aware of the complains and have launched investigations. “If this is true, we are definitely going to take action as soon as possible. As a federation, we are not going to encourage cheating,” he said. He said many people have raised the red flag and they are very much on the case. “If it’s true, there is no place for her to hide and she will definitely not proceed to camp for the World Cross Country Championships. We are serious about cheating and doping and we are not going to tolerate anyone who want to walk that route,” he added.
