Samburu Governor Moses Lenolkulal said he will cooperate with the EACC to investigate Sh2 billion graft and recover funds.. The agency on Wednesday raided the governor’s Karen home over the cash. They left with several documents and electronic equipment. Yesterday, Lenolkulal told residents yesterday that the county is open to scrutiny so the case can be put to rest. Lenolkulal urged the EACC to conduct honest investigations and not a witch-hunt. “We gave indications from the onset to fully cooperate so the issue is fully settled,” he said in Maralal town. The county chief boss said it would be “evil” of him to oversee misappropriation and embezzlement of public funds. He said those found culpable must be punished.
