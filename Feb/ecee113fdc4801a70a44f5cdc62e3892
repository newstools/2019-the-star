The Nairobi government has highlighted its achievements for 2016-17 and to the middle of 2018-19.
When Governor Mike Sonko took the oath of office in 2017, he had promised to fix Nairobi’s problems within 100 days. That included ending traffic snarl-ups, the garbage problem and fixing roads.
One and half years later, the city is still grappling with the same challenges, with slight improvements.
Some achievements cited in the Fiscal Strategy Paper for 2019-20 are improved infrastructure, better healthcare, better waste management and education.
In transport, 55km roads have been tarmacked, 130km graded and gravelled and 5.3km walkways constructed. About 39,000 streetlights have been installed and 20,800 public lights maintained.
In an earlier interview with the Star, Transport executive Mohammed Dagane said, “All roads will be completed with walkways and drainage.”
The Health department has enhanced maternal care. It targets skilled attendants and expansion of immunisation coverage by 12 per cent. In mid 2018-19, Pumwani Maternity Hospital was equipped with a cold room and extra delivery wards.
Acting Health executive Charles Kerich said the county converted a medicine storage room and an unused matron’s house into wards.
“The hospital will now have 100 beds in the two new wards to ease congestion,” he said.
In waste management, 900 tonnes of solid waste are collected daily and taken to the Dandora Dumpsite. Sixty tonnes of solid waste have been recovered from Nairobi River and its banks and about 10km of riparian land recovered.
