Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja on Monday cleared a Sh85,000 medical bill for DusitD2 terror attack survivor Emmanuel Omala. Sakaja also paid Omala's rent for six months and promised to help him get back to school. A day earlier, Citizen TV highlighted Omala's story. He said he was shot seven times on the stomach during the January 15 attack that left 21 people dead. Omala told Citizen that he had signed an agreement with the hospital to be paying Sh3,000 every month until he clears bill. The bill had accumulated to Sh100,000 and Omala had paid only Sh15,000. "I had gone to deliver meat at the complex when I encountered the terrorists. I saw them. They were shooting aimlessly and I was caught up," Omala narrated. "I was admitted to Kenyatta hospital. Deputy President William Ruto visited us and told us the government would foot for all the medical bills for the victims. The next day, Health CS Sicily Kariuki also visited us and made the same promise," he said. However, Omala's family got a rude shock when they were told to clear the bill since there was a "change in the government plan". "We were surprised when we were told to pay ourselves since the government said the attack was not a national disaster," Omala's father said. The family had committed to clear the bill in 28 months before Sakaja was touched and pledged to clear the bill today. Click here for the latest political news
