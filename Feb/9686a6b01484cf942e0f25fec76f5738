University of Nairobi lecturers have backed the appointment of four deputy vice chancellors by Education CS Amina Mohamed. They want the four to assume office immediately. The DVCs are Prof Mohamud Jama (Finance, Planning and Development), Prof William Ogara (Human Resource and Administration), Prof Lydia Njenga (Research, Production and Extension) and Prof Julius Ogengo (Academic Affairs). The dons yesterday said their secretary George Omondi had communicated with the four. Last week, the university council protested Amina’s decision, saying she ignored the names it recommended for appointment. The council conducted interviews on January 7-9. It said the CS ignored those who emerged tops. The council said that of the four, they recommended only Ogengo. The council has sought the Attorney General’s advisory opinion. It says Amina overstepped her mandate. But the lecturers said the CS did not break the law or violate education or university policy. “The university has many challenges that require immediate and priority attention. These include financial constraints, infrastructural deficiencies, stalled staff promotions and collapsed staff medical scheme among others,” Omondi said. “The focus of the council and the entire senior management team must be these challenges and not petty squabbles and protests.” They said the appointment was done for the benefit of students, staff, partners and the country. “We urge the council and all stakeholders to accept those who have been appointed and support them to speedily settle down and execute their function,” Omondi said. The appointments are dated January 15. The DVCs have until Tuesday to accept the appointments but the council has resolved not to issue contracts, pending resolution of the crisis. Click here for
