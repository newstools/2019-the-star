Residents of Kimoso village in Baringo Central subcounty have raised the alarm over a stray hyena which killed six sheep and seven goats on Friday night. “We woke up this morning to the sad news of farmers complaining they found their missing livestock dead in the nearby bush. Some were eaten while other carcasses were abandoned,” resident Israel Kiplimo said. Salawa chief Christopher Chemjor said Kenya Wildlife Service officers have been informed. The residents said they will hunt down and kill the animal if the KWS team does not act urgently. The farmers believe the same hyena is responsible for the death of 39 sheep and goats in Kiboino village in July last year. Led by Simon Kiptegen, the farmers said they are yet to be compensated for the loss of their 17 sheep and 22 goats. “We thought it was a leopard but today we have spotted a hyena that may have escaped from the nearby Rimoi Game Reserve in Elgeyo Marakwet county,” he said. Kiptegen said the animals are the farmers' only source of livelihood and urged KWS to compensate them. Senior KWS warden for Baringo, Dickson Tonui, said officers have been sent to the scene. "We had laid some traps to capture the animals and transport them back to the game reserve, but we didn’t succeed," he said. Tonui urged residents to beware of roving animals as the situation is brought under control. Click here for the latest political news
