Governor Mike Sonko and the Nairobi Sports Management Board have pledged Sh250,000 in sponsorship for the Ziwani Football Tournament. The sponsorship is in memory of sports journalist James Oduor, popularly known as "Odu Cobra", who was among the 21 victims of the DusitD2 attack on January 15. Oduor was known for his passion for football. “No amount equates the life and talent we have lost, but we pray for strength and hope in this trying time for the family to find comfort,” Sonko said in a Facebook post on Friday. Oduor will be buried on Saturday in Likwala, Ugenya subcounty. A memorial service was held for him on Thursday at All Saints Cathedral, Nairobi. Sonko has previously supported sported sports events. In December 2017, he catered for the transport of football fans heading to Machakos from Nairobi for the Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup final at Kenyatta Stadium.
