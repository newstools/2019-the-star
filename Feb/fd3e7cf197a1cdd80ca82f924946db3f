Six doctors have lost an appeal on racial discrimination claims against Kenya Medical Research Institute. Samson Gwer, Michael Mwaniki, Nahashon Thuo, John Wangai, Moses Ndiritu and Albert Komba have also lost Sh5 million each awarded by the labour court. Court of Appeal judges Milton Makhandia, Patrick Kiage and Agnes Murgor quashed justice Nduma Nderi’s decision which had given the doctors a win. The judges said the doctors did not deserve to be compensated because they did not prove the allegations of racism and chose to stay away from work. “We think the learned judge erred in granting the Sh5 million which is all the more baffling because there is absolutely no basis for that sum,” the ruling said. “Not only were the alleged violations and injuries not proved, some, which are consequential upon their loss of employment and studies while at Kemri, were fully of their own making. Their suspension was for merely a day after which they were recalled but they would hear none of it.” The doctors were Kemri employees.
