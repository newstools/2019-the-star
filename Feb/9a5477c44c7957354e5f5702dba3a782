Shabana assistant coach Andrew Kanuli has termed the team’s 4-1 win over Kenya Police a morale booster ahead of upcoming assignments. “This was a very critical win because we had not won in four games. That win will motivate players to do well in upcoming matches,” he said. He said they are targeting wins in their three upcoming games to keep their dream of qualifying to the top flight league alive. “We moved to from 10th to 7th position after winning against Kenya Police. If we win three matches, we will move back to top four,” he added. Nixon Amulundu, Dennis Onyancha, Wycliffe Nyangechi and Anthony Ndolo were on target for Shabana while David Oluoch scored the law enforcers’ consolation in the match played on Sunday at Camp Toyoyo. Tomorrow, Shabana travel to Thika to face newbies Fortune Sacco at Thika Sub County Stadium. Kanuli hopes Nyangechi and striker Oscar Oketch will be fit for the game. Log leaders Wazito will be at Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega to face Green Commandos as they seek to maintain the top position in the league. Second-placed Ushuru will be up against St Joseph’s Youth at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru while Nairobi Stima, the only unbeaten team in the league so far, will look to keep their unbeaten record when they tackle struggling and bottom of the table, Kangemi All Stars at Camp Toyoyo. Nairobi City Stars and Talanta will square it out at Hope Centre in the first of the double header. In the second game, Kibera Black Stars hosts Thika United. Kenya Police and Eldoret Youth hope to return to winning ways when they clash at Karuturi grounds in Naivasha. Coast Stima and Kisumu All Stars face off at Moi Stadium in Kisumu as Modern Coast Rangers host Bidco United at Serani grounds. At Awendo Green Stadium, Migori Youth will play Administration Police.
