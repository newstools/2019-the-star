Police clashed with mourners at a funeral in Kilifi and arrested 62 people. Seven officers were injured on Friday night when they raided a homestead to stop disco matanga during a vigil for Munga Ziro of Ngerenya village. The Institute of Human Rights condemned the incident. Executive director Eric Mgoja said the era of arbitrary arrests was long gone. Speaking to the Star yesterday, Mgoja faulted the police for conducting a swoop on a funeral. “The police should have put in place a well thought out plan on how to get the people who attacked the police officers,” Mgoja said. Kilifi OCPD Njoroge Ngigi confirmed the arrests and said the suspects would be arraigned today. “The police went to stop the disco at around midnight but the mourners turned against them, throwing stones and mnazi bottles at them. I cannot say who was at the funeral that night or not because even if you ask all those who have been arrested they will deny. All of them will be taken to court for assaulting police officers,” Ngigi said. Ngerenya chief Augustus Kiti said the family had been warned against having the disco but went ahead. Kiti said he did not accompany police officers during the night to stop the disco. Former Kilifi county commander Fredrick Ochieng said police officers should raid homesteads before the disco starts. Chiefs who spoke on condition of anonymity said they submit a weekly report on homesteads they suspect would conduct disco matanga. Police have been blamed for taking bribes to allow disco matanga despite being informed by the chiefs on time. Click here for the latest political news
