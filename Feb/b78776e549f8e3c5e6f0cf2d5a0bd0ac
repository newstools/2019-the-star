East African Portland Cement Board of directors have appointed Stephen Nthei as acting MD to replace Simon ole Nkeri who was sent on leave last week. Nkeri was directed to go on leave from February 18 under unclear circumstances. Nthei is the current head of financial management and the senior-most official at EAPCC after Nkeri. In a letter dated February 20, company secretary, Sheila Kahuki explained that Nthei will act as MD the entire time Nkeri is on leave. The company is reeling under debts exceeding more than Sh2 billion. Kajiado East MP Peris Tobiko and nominated Jubilee senator Mary Seneta have in the past accused Nkeri of failing to work closely with the communities where the company mines raw materials. Nkeri, on his part, has also accused former directors of the EAPCC of colluding with politicians to bring down the company. Click here for the latest political news
