Nairobi county staff have gone on strike to protest the failure by Governor Mike Sonko's administration to implement the 2012 Collective Bargaining Agreement. The workers assembled outside City Hall at 9 am on Tuesday carrying placards and singing solidarity songs. If fully implemented, the 13,000 workers would get a 15 to 28 per cent salary increment. The county government workers union (KCGWU) secretary general Roba Duba said the strike would go on until their demands are met. Sonko had promised to have the CBA implemented by January this year.
