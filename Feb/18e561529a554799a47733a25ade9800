The Chinese entrepreneur who started the first donkey slaughterhouse in Kenya has died. Lu Jing, 74, died on Sunday while undergoing treatment in a private health facility. He was buried on Wednesday in Mogotio, Baringo county, at his premises as per the Chinese culture. He is survived by two children. Lu owned Goldox Ltd , a Sh300 million donkey slaughterhouse based in Mogotio. The three-year-old abattoir stands on 10 acres. Lu slaughtered an average of 400 donkeys daily. The abattoir employed over 250 people. The proprietor also owned the only Chinese restaurant in Nakuru town. Lu became a Kenyan citizen in 1989 and was involved in civic duties. His associates told The Star that he has invested heavily both in Rift Valley and Nairobi in the hospitality industry. His slaughterhouse sold meat to Russia, China and other Far East countries where donkey products are in high demand. The government, through the Meat Control (Amendment) Act 2012, approved donkey and horse meat as food.
