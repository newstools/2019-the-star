Nandi Governor Stephen Sang, MPs Kimani Ichungwah (Kikuyu) and his Kapsaret counterpart Oscar Sudi have been summoned to appear in court for linking Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho to drug trafficking. The three are expected to appear before the High Court within 15 days, failure to which a full proceeding against them will begin. The three legislators are said to have claimed that Joho’s name was in a list tabled in Parliament by the late George Saitoti in 2010. The list of six names was in a US embassy dossier, which the then US ambassador Michael Ranneberger had given to the then Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission. Joho has demanded an apology from the Jubilee leaders. Through a letter by his lawyer Kelvin Ochieng on Tuesday, Joho demanded that Sang apologises to him within 24 hours. Sang had fired at Joho, claiming among other things, that he had "misled the country on the handshake and destroyed many youths through the drug business that he runs." But Joho, through a letter written by Ochieng, demanded that the media pulls down articles on the allegations. In response, Sudi said the Governor can go ahead and sue them. “Please go to court with your lawyers, we also have lawyers and we shall assemble and table both the Akasha and George Saitoti reports," he said at a press briefing. Joho has also demanded the International Police Organisation -Interpol to clarify the authenticity of a controversial letter dated November 2018 that claimed he was on Interpol's organised crimes and drug trafficking most-wanted list The Governor, though, who is not listed in the crime buster’s website, claims his critics have taken advantage of the letter making rounds on social media to advance a political agenda aimed at maligning his name. "This has caused irreparable damage and will continue to do so if there is no official confirmation from your office on the authenticity or lack thereof of the said statement and notice,” he said.
