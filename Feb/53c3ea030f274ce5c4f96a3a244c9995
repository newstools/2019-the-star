Two diplomats and their drivers are admitted at Machakos Level 5 Hospital after they were involved in an accident on the Nairobi-Mombasa highway. The diplomats are Zambia High Commissioner to Kenya Brenda Muntemba and her Botswana counterpart Duke Lephoko. The Tuesday evening accident occurred at Lukenya in Athi River, Machakos County. Preliminary reports indicate that the duo sustained injuries after Mudenda's car collided head-on with an oncoming lorry. Lephoko's car, which was following closely, then rammed into the stalled vehicle. They were on their way to Nairobi from a meeting at Maanzoni Lodge in Athi River, a short distance from the scene of the incident. The accident caused heavy traffic along Mombasa road between Mlolongo and Makutano junction. Machakos governor Aldred Mutua was among those who visited the diplomats at the hospital. Athi River traffic commander Moses Kimeli told the Star on the phone that the accident occurred after the lorry's driver defied orders from police escorting the diplomat to pave way. "There was a police escort vehicle with a siren which was leading the high commissioners' motorcade. Despite the officers' efforts to make the lorry's driver stop and give way for the diplomat's cars, he refused to stop leading to the accident," said Kimeli. Kimeli who led the rescue operation with assistance from Kyumbi police station's OCS Erick Githinji said they were able to clear traffic jam in good time. He said all the three vehicles involved in the accident had been towed to Kyumbi police station. Click here for the latest political news
