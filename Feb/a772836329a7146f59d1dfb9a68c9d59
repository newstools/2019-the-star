Nzoia Water and Sewerage Company workers from Bungoma and Trans Nzoia counties on Friday protested against alleged bias at the firm. More than 50 workers stormed the firm’s head offices in Webuye Town. The workers, led by branch secretary Erick Nasokho, accused the board of being compromised in shortlisting candidates for the position of managing director. They accused some of the shortlisted candidates, who are staff members, of having wrecked the company. The candidates were shortlisted on January 25, and will be interviewed on February 28. The firm also advertised positions of internal auditor and human resources manager. Dickson Opiyo has been the acting managing director in the past two months. The recruitment comes after the term of former managing director Patrick Munialo expired. Workers also complained that all the shortlisted candidates are from outside Trans Nzoia county. “We are wondering why there is no person shortlisted from Trans Nzoia to the position of MD yet we have people who applied and are qualified,” said Nasokho. He asked acting MD Opiyo to halt theprocess until further notice. “We do not have confidence in this board carrying out recruitment since we believe that they are compromised. We want the Lake Victoria board or a recruitment consultancy to do the recruitment,” he said. The workers asked Opiyo to continue serving as the managing director since there was no hurry to appoint a new one. Opiyo assured the workers that their grievances will be addressed. The firm’s commercial manager Bernard Kikechi praised the workers for their hard work. He asked them to go back to work. The protest had paralysed operations for the better part of the day yesterday. The firm has been facing wrangles and some Trans Nzoia lawmakers demand that it be split from Bungoma.
