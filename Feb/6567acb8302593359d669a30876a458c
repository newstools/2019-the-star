The first results from Nigeria's presidential vote have been declared. So far, two of Nigeria's 36 states have been declared, and President Muhammadu Buhari has taken the most votes in both of them. They are Osun State and Ekiti State, shown in green in the map below. Taken together, the president has 566,865 votes and his main rival Atiku Abubakar has 491,409. The candidate with the most votes is declared the winner in the first round, as long as that person gains at least 25% of the votes in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states. Nigerians went to the polls on 23 February, with President Muhammadu Buhari (APC) expected to face a strong challenge from Atiku Abubakar (PDP) in the presidential contest.
