Murang’a county has employed 100 nurses to reach out to patients in their homes in a programme dubbed Tiba Mashinani. Governor Mwangi wa Iria on Tuesday said the nurses will be required to work together with the more than 1,000 community health workers the county has engaged, to identify patients who require attention. The governor saidhis administration resolved to hire nurses on a five-year contract to ensure the county is not affected by the constant strikes. “The nurses keep striking because they are employed on permanent and pensionable terms and the strikes have detrimental effects on the public,” Wa Iria said. He said the Tiba Mashinani programme is geared towards achieving Universal Health Coverage and will bring health services closer to the people. Many patients endure pain and suffering at home as they are unable to raise money to visit a hospital, he said. The programme will be steered by Maragua Level 4 Hospital’s superintendent Stephen Ngige. Nurses who perform well will have their contract renewed, he said. He spoke at Ihura Stadium during a meeting with the new nurses, adding that 100 more nurses will be employed in two weeks.
