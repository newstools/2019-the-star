Embu professionals have denied claims they formed an association to campaign for political seats. Members of the newly formed Embu County Professionals and Development Association told politicians they were not interested in unseating them. The association’s chairman Ibrahim Mwathane on Friday said they will inform the politicians of their activities. He said members with political ambitions will be asked to pursue their dreams outside the association. The group on Friday started visiting schools where members intend to encourage students to improve performance. He said the professionals’ interest was to give intellectual guidance to solve numerous problems in the society. “We appreciate our politicians who are doing a good job. But there are very many things political players are not able to do and which a professional can without engaging in politics,” Mwathane said. He said the group has 300 members including those aged 60 and above. “They are people who have done their business in life and have not engaged in politics.” He said the association will give professionals an opportunity to interact with residents without being misunderstood as politicians. “We are telling those joining us that if he or she has a political calling to step out and do his business out there and not within the association. We will be very religious to this requirement so we don’t get entangled in political misconceptions. Mwathane spoke at Gichiche Primary School in Embu East where the team encouraged students. They were accompanied by Planning chief officer Mary Munene who studied at the school. Mwathane asked that the association be given chance to work for residents.
