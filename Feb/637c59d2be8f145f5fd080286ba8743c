In a TV interview, he warned that US President Donald Trump would leave the White House "stained with blood" if he intervened in the crisis. He also defiantly rejected the EU's Sunday deadline to call snap elections. Opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared himself interim president last month and won US backing. He said on Sunday he would build an international coalition to deliver humanitarian aid to Venezuelans but Mr Maduro has accused him of organising a coup.
