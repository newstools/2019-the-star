The three-mile-long river strip separating Garissa and Tana River counties should be scrapped, Garissa Governor Ali Korane shas said. The boundary, along River Tana, pushes Garissa county about six kilometres miles away from the river. River Tana runs 400km between the two counties. Governor Korane was addressing the Building Bridges to Unity Advisory Task Force in Garissa town on Friday. The task force is chaired by Garissa Senator Mohamed Yusuf Haji. Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chair Dubat Amey said the boundary line discriminated against the people of Garissa because it puts Kenya’s largest river in Tana River county. This means Garissa cannot share resources of the river, he said. “For the colonial government to have enacted such law pushing our people three miles away from River Tana was not only discriminatory but also a recipe for chaos,” Dubat said. He opposed any attempts at merging counties in an effort to save money. “We need all the 47 counties to remain intact. Our people have seen the fruits of devolution because resources are brought to the grassroots and we are not ready to be governed from elsewhere,” he said.
