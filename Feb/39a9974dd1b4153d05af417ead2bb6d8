The management of Sarit Center has dismissed claims that the Shopping Complex is being targeted by terrorists. In a statement on Wednesday, the management asked Kenyans to disregard the fake security alert being circulated on social media platforms. “We have not received any specific alert from the authorities regarding the heighten security at the Sarit Center and we continue to work closely with them to do our level best to provide our shoppers with a safe and comfortable shopping environment,” the management said in a statement to the media. It also asked members of the public to refrain from sharing and forwarding unverified messages whose aim is to spread fear and cause panic. The message claims that security has been beefed up around the shopping centre in Westland due to an impending terror attack. On January 25, the US advised Kenyans to stay vigilant in public spaces such as shopping malls, hotels, and places of worship citing them as a key target area to terrorists. On January 15 this year, al Shabaab claimed to be responsible for the terror attack at Dusit-D2 hotel which left 21 people dead. The terror group claimed that the attack was due to US President Donald Trump's move to recognize the city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital on December 6, 2017.
