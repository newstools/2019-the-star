A 36-year-old mother of three is recovering at J.M. Hospital after she was battered and burned with hot water by her husband at Uhuru village, Ol Kalou in Nyandarua county. Hannah Muthoni sustained 8 per cent first-degree burns and injuries to her left eye and hand during the Friday incident. She was taken to the hospital by neighbours in critical condition. Speaking at the hospital on Wednesday, she said her husband, Benson Wachira assaulted her after she defended her daughter against an accusation that she had put excess salt in food a day before. Mirangine deputy county commissioner, Omar Ali, told the Star that they have launched a manhunt for Wachira. After beating his wife, Wachira took a thermos flask of hot water and emptied its content on Muthoni before crashing the flask on her. She sustained severe burns on the head, neck, back and left hand. A nurse at J.M.Memorial hospital ward one said Muthoni is responding well to treatment. Muthoni said her husband has been violent for 12 years she has lived with Wachira. Click here for the latest political news.
