The government has confirmed that Mama Ngina waterfront is indeed public land and efforts are underway to reclaim the it. Tourism CS Najib Balala said his ministry has written to Lands CS Farida Karoney to help in the revocation and have the parcel returned to the government. Balala said the government has so far repossessed eight hectares and is pursuing the remaining six still in private hands. The Mama Ngina waterfront was known for hosting Kenya Golf Club, Florida Nightclub and public recreation area. “The eight hectares are already gazetted and we are now chasing the pieces that are in the periphery as directed by President Uhuru Kenyatta in January,” Balala said. The President, while launching the multi-million waterfront in January, ordered the National Land Commision to reclaim grabbed land within five months.
