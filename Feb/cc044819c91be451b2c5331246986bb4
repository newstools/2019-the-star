Detectives have arrested a taxi driver and rescued two Burundi nationals suspected to be victims of human trafficking. The two women were intercepted by DCI Detectives on Friday morning as they prepared to depart the country to the Middle East. "Investigations are already underway to nab all suspects," Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss George Kinoti said even though he did not disclose much information. Kenya has been flagged as a source, transit, and destination country for persons subjected to forced labour and sex trafficking in East Africa. A US Department of State report titled "Trafficking in Persons Report 2018", assesses the government's commitment to end human trafficking in 2017. It shows Kenya continues to host illegal recruiters who maintain networks in Uganda and Ethiopia. They recruit Rwandan, Ethiopians, and Ugandan workers through fraudulent offers of employment in the Middle East and Asia. This is despite a directive by the government to register all agencies linking Kenyans to employment opportunities overseas.
