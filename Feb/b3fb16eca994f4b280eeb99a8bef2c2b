Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti has a huge task of reshaping the county after the Supreme Court upheld his reelection last Thursday. Awiti has not been in the county due to illness for more than three months including the time the apex court validated his reelection. The county government has been described as moribund in service delivery, accused of corruption and still faces court cases among its officials It is these issues among others that MPs Peter Kaluma (Homa Bay Town), Millie Odhiambo (Suba North) and Senator Moses Kajwang’ want the county to deal with to win the trust of residents. Currently, members of the Public Service Board are in office on court order after the county assembly passed a motion to disband it. Seven chief officers sued the government for allegedly relieving them of their duties before their contracts expired. A civil society called Bunge La Wenye Nchi has collected more than 40,000 signatures to disband Awiti’s government on grounds of poor governance. On Friday, Kaluma and Odhiambo asked Awiti to convene a political leaders’ meeting to discuss development of the county. They argue that Awiti will get views from leaders on how to undertake development. “There should be an effective way of undertaking development projects in every corner of the county. It’s high time we collectively take the responsibility of developing Homa Bay,” Kaluma said. The MP said lack of consultations has negatively affected implementation of projects. “Awiti now has a chance to serve the people until 2022. But he needs not to work in isolation of other elected leaders. The meeting should be to get advice on how develop residents,” he said. Odhiambo wants Awiti to restructure his Cabinet for better service delivery. “The governor should take charge of the county. He needs to have people who can perform in office,” Odhiambo said.
