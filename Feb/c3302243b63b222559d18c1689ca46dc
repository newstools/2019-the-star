The Kilifi county government has launched a vaccination programme aimed at preventing deaths from Rift Valley fever and other diseases affecting domestic animals. Officers from the Department of Livestock and Veterinary Services are targeting over 500,000 goats, sheep, cattle and even dogs in all the eight sub counties. The vaccination program which will take over one month was planned ahead of February before the start of heavy rains to prevent any loss of domestic animals as witnessed in previous years. Kilifi county Chief Officer for Livestock Development Fredrick Kaingu said they aim was to vaccinate at least 70 per cent of the livestock population. Speaking at Tsangatsini in Kaloleni sub county during the launch of the exercise on Thursday, Kaingu said dogs will not be left out since they are normally affected by rabies. “Our aim is to vaccinate most of the livestock population because food security is among the Big Four Agenda. Kilifi County set aside a good budget for the exercise,’’ he said. Last year he said the Malindi slaughterhouse and all butcheries in the sub county were closed down because of an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever. Kaingu said plans are underway to create disease-free zones in the Coast region to prevent the spread of such diseases. To achieve this, the county plans to spend Sh60 million to relocate and build new modern slaughterhouses in Malindi and Mariakani this year. Click here for the latest political news
