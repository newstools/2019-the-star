An appeal by woman who was jailed for 15 years for having sex with a 16-year-old boy in Kisumu has been dismissed. Judith Wandera’s mother broke down in tears immediately after the ruling by High Court judge Fred Ochieng. The mother, who was accompanied by Wandera’s sister, later fainted; two women journalists performed first aid to revive her. Wandera, 24, had appealed the ruling of principal magistrate Joan Wambilyanga on May 23 last yer. On Thursday, Justice Ochieng dismissed the appeal saying the conviction was founded upon evidence that proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. Wandera had been found guilty of defilement and performing an indecent act with a minor. She admitted to having a sexual relationship with the boy, saying she didn’t know he was a minor. The offence occurred on July 15, 2017, at Kicomi in Kisumu county.
