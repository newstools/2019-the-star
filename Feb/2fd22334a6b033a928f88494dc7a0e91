Mombasa county has been shortlisted to host the International Desalination Association congress in 2021. This is a biennial meeting widely recognised as the premier global event on desalination and water re-use. If successful, it will be the first time the congress is held in Africa. It was started in 1985 and has now been hosted in 17 cities in 12 non-African countries. County director of communications Richard Chacha said in 2018,the county participated in the IDA water congress in Spain and showcased its desalination plans. “Mombasa county then decided to take part in the bidding to host the 2021 IDA world water congress,”he said. The coastal city is among 14 cities interested in hosting the event. The others are Barcelona, Daegu, Calgary, Cape Town, Chennai,Durban, Hyderabad, Malta, Manchester, Melbourne, Munich, Muscat and Sydney. “We made it to the second round of ten cities and now Mombasa stands among the top four finalists against Melbourne and Sydney in Australia and Daegu in Korea,” Chacha said. A team of inspectors from IDA is expected in the country next Monday to assess Mombasa’s ability to host the congress, which is scheduled for October 2021. IDA is the world’s leading resource for information and professional development for the global desalination industry. It is anticipated that by 2021, two desalination plants will be set up, one in Shanzu for 100,000 cubic metres per day, and Likoni for 10,000 cubic metres. “The contracts were awarded to two Spanish companies and the signing ceremony was held late last year in the presence of Governor Hassan Joho and other stakeholders,” Chacha said. IDA serves more than 2,600 members in 60 countries.
