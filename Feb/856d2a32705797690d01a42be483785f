Parliament will today take another attempt at marshalling members to vote towards passing the two-thirds gender rule. Leader of Majority Aden Duale yesterday said the House Business Committee will this afternoon put the question for the vote. The Garissa Township MP said that he has directed party whips to lobby and send text messages to members. “I have requested our sisters in the house to speak with each other. At least every county should get six people voting to pass the constitutional bill,” he said. “I will do my best to ensure that we have a question put to this matter.” It would take the mobilization of the political parties, especially main formations Jubilee and Nasa, to have the bill sail through to the third reading stage. The legislation requires two-thirds, majority or at least 233 of the MPs to support it. The move follows concerns that the House risks being judged as being in violation of Article 100 of the Constitution. The law says that Parliament shall enact legislation to promote the representation in Parliament of women, persons with disabilities, youth, ethnic and other minorities, and marginalised communities. The National Assembly, as constituted today, is yet to comply with the requirement as stipulated in the constitution. Currently, there are 76 women in the National Assembly of which 23 are elected from constituencies, 47 women representatives and six nominated. The Senate has 21 women senators who include 19 nominated and three elected members. Speaker Justin Muturi asked members to be available for the crucial vote, asking leaders of parties in the House to ensure members come in their droves for the vote. “Instead of doing what I see in the morning, let members come to the chamber and speak to those of us who are here,” he said. In November last year, the vote was put on hold for lack of quorum. The additional time was to give political parties more time to lobby and come up with responses to the Gender Bill.
