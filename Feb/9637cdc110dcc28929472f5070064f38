Gaudencia Makokha believes the newly introduced national beach volleyball circuit will help improve the country’s preparations for major international assignments going forward. Makokha sentiments comes after she partnered with Kenya Pipeline’s Naomi Too to comfortably see off Aspire pair of veteran Edinah Rotich and Phosca Kasisi 2-0 (21-16, 21-13) in the women’s final at the Strathmore University grounds yesterday. Makokha and Too beat Divas pair of Gladys Wangui and Leonida Kasaya 2-0 in semis while Rotich and Kasisi defeated KCB’s Eunice Maiyo and Salome Wanjala 2-1 to qualify  for the final. The Kenya Pipeline right attacker said on many occasions, national teams in the circles has had little time to train ahead of the International championship and that has led to dismal results. The player at the same time said having the circuit at various locations across the country will give chance to players who have always wanted to venture in the sport but lack the neccessary resources. “It is a good thing that the federation has introduced beach volleyball calendar. This will definitely keep the players in shape while the commission will have options in as far as the selection of the national team players is concerned,” said Makokha. She added: “Numbers don’t lie. The turnout of players was impressive and that simply means there are many beach volleyball players out here. With this kind of arrangement, the future of beach volleyball in the country is bright and I’m happy we won the first edition. We hope to extend the good run during the second edition on March 2-3 in Mombasa.”
