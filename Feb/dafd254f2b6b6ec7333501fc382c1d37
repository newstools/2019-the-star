The government will fund 90,744 students who scored C+ and above in last year’s KCSE examination to pursue degree courses locally. The sponsorship has been extended to those who will join Technical and Vocational Training institutions. Education CS Amina Mohamed yesterday said 651,189 students qualified for placement in tertiary institutions. Out of that number, 121,288 scored between C plain and C– and are eligible for diploma courses in TVET institutions. Some 244,436, scored D and D+ and are eligible for craft certificate courses. The ministry said 194,721 with E and D– will be selected to artisan courses at the 800 Vocational Education and Training institutions. “This year’s applications will continue until February 23. I invite all candidates who wish to revise their choices for degree, diploma and certificate courses for government sponsorship to proceed with the exercise as soon as the portal is open,” Amina said. The period allows students to select the disciplines they wish to pursue in line with the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service cut-off points. Read:Students need career advice, says don This year’s university admissions, representing only 15 per cent of students who sat last year’s KCSE exam, will increase universities enrolment to 649,954 students. The government is pushing for 100 per cent transition from secondary schools to universities and tertiary institutions. The limited capacity in colleges and institutions, however, frustrates the ministry’s ambition to realise the transition to tertiary institutions. Intake headache There are 130 functional technical and vocational training institutions. The ministry data shows that the institutions have an enrolment capacity of 300,000 students. The institutions have 170,000 students. Some 103,433 learners are in technical and vocational colleges, while 89,598 are in youth polytechnics. This will be a challenge during the placement as more than 200,000 students will have to seek alternatives in pursuing higher education. TVET Principal Secretary Kevit Desai yesterday said the ministry is pushing for full uptake of slots available at the technical and vocational education and training institutions. “We can accommodate many students. Each polytechnic can accommodate up to 12,000 students, while the technical and vocational colleges can take between 5,000 and 7,000 students,” he said.
