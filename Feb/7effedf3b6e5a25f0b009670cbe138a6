Mombasa nurses will go on strike next month if the county government does not respond to their demands. National secretary general Seth Panyako on Sunday said there would be no strike in Mombasa, Migori and Machakos because the counties had fully paid the allowances the nurses demanded. But branch secretary general Peter Maroko yesterday raised issues of promotions, pay deductions and staffing. Maroko urged the Hassan Joho administration to act to avert an industrial action. “There are remittances they deduct from our insurances, like PAYE, loan deductions and many others, for three months now. There are also issues of promotions, employment and re-designation which Mombasa county government has not addressed,” he said. The Kenya National Union of Nurses issued a notice that 21 counties will boycott work. The number reduced to 11. They are Nairobi, Kisumu, Kisii, Embu, Elgeyo Marakwet, Nyandarua, Nyeri, Trans Nzoia, West Pokot, Kitui, Wajir and Taita Taveta. Yesterday, nurses from these devolved units did not report to work. Some counties committed to pay all the allowances before the end of this month. On Sunday, KNUN boss Panyako said nurses from Kiambu, Marsabit and Homa Bay counties will join the strike tomorrow, whereas those from Kwale, Garissa, Samburu, Embu and Kirinyaga counties will start theirs on Monday next week. Panyako accused the counties of being reluctant to pay nurses their dues. He lashed out at Labour CS Ukur Yatani for being mum on the agreement signed in November last year with the devolved units. The CS formed a conciliation committee to discuss the strike, but Panyako insisted that the nurses will stay away from work. Maroko warned Yatani against being biased. “If he shows that he has bad intentions with the nurses then he will not find a solution to the problem.” Last year, nurses went on strike for five months.
