Good Morning Embattled National Land Commission chiefs have blamed the Ministry of Lands as the greatest impediment to their work even as they exit office today after a six-year controversial stint. In their exit report seen exclusively by the Star, the Commission whose tenure was rocked by graft scandals claims the ministry continues to encroach on its mandate despite a Supreme Court verdict in 2015. Here are the other stories making headlines in the Star this Tuesday morning. Murdered lawyer: Cops believe killers hired The police investigating the brutal murder of lawyer Robert Chesang' believe the death is linked to a business deal gone wrong. Chesang', 45, was gunned down in cold blood inside his Moke Gardens home in Lukenya, Machakos county on Sunday. The daring killers first kidnapped two guards at the main gate of the estate. They then demanded they be shown the lawyer's house. When one of the guards refused to cooperate, his elbow was smashed with the butt of an AK-47. _____________________________________________________ After raising hopes of land reforms, Swazuri team leaves under a cloud “You must have a stiff spine and a cool head, guided by the Constitution. The intricate web and reach of interests around land is powerful and smart. The sheer struggle to have you sworn in today is a foretaste of the weight and perils of your assignment.” These words were uttered by the then Chief Justice, Willy Mutunga, during the swearing-in of National Land Commission officials on February 27, 2013. But as the team exits after their six-year term, players in the land sector say the commissioners dashed hopes of land reforms, sanitised land grabbing and cemented land fraud. _____________________________________________________ The anti-graft agency is after Sh29.58 billion stolen since 2013 The anti-graft agency is in the process of recovering Sh29.58 billion stolen in the country since 2013.
