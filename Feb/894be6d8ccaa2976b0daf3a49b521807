Nominated Senator Millicent Omanga says the worst thing people have done to her on social media was the memes produced when she clashed with Embakasi East MP Babu Owino. The two clashed after the senator told the MP to respect Interior CS Fred Matiang’i. "I saw people drawing me sitting on Babu Owino," she told Word Is on Friday. "It was really embarrassing and I felt so bad because I tried to imagine what if my daughter or son sees that about their mother, or they go to school and their friends are like, 'Your mum was on social media doing this and that'. That one killed me." In a Facebook post that was later deleted, Omanga called Babu a ‘small boy’ and said she would deal with him personally if the government failed to. She also said she would circumcise the MP, a statement that infuriated Babu. The vocal MP retaliated in the comments, claiming Senator Omanga had slept with many men to make it to the top, then shared a photo of a hippo wearing a bikini and named it “Millipedes Omanga”. Omanga, however, said she had tried to let her children understand what goes on on social media. "I start pre-empting and talking to them and explaining to them that nowadays this and that is happening on social media, indirectly, so that in case they come across something because sometimes they might not tell you, they will remember mum told us this and that," she said. The two legislators have since resolved their differences. They were together at an event where they were awarding bursaries to needy students in Babu's constituency. "Babu has been my friend since our days in university and we support each other," she said.
