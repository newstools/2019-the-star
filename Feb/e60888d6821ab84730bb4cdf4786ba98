Contractors will have their tenders revoked if they do not deliver on their projects in time and as specified. Water CS Simon Chelugui put lazy contractors on notice, saying the government wants value for money. “Contractors should ensure they do quality work on time and as specified in the contracts,” Chelugui said. He spoke in Kiambu on Friday after a meeting to end stalemate over compensation to allow the rollout of water projects. The CS said the government has put an elaborate plan to address water shortage. “It is part of the Big Four agenda. We’ll ensure all projects are implemented,” The meeting was attended by PS Joseph Irungu, National Land Commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri, Kiambu Governbor Ferdinand Waititu, Senator Kimani Wamatangi, MPs Jude Njomo (Kiambu Town), Wanjiku Kibe (Gatundu North), Moses Kuria (Gatundu South), Simon King’ara (Ruiru), Patrick Wainaina (Thika Town) and Woman Representative Gathoni Wamuchomba. Chelugui said the construction of Sh24 billion Kariminu II Dam in Gatundu North will start immediately after a 12-year compensation standoff with landowners was resolved. The project is being undertaken in Kiriko, Buchana, Gathanji and Kariminu villages. The dam will supply water to Ruiru, Juja and Nairobi residents. “I’ve done my best to advocate for fair compensation,” Waititu said. He asked residents to support the project.
