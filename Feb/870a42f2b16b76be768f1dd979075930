"Moses Kuria hails from Kiambu and we respect him because he is our friend. But I want to put the record straight that there is no confusion at all in the direction that we are headed as a community. We are waiting for that time," he said. But Kuria retorted, “I am not contesting at your home, leave me alone.” He said he has looked left and right and realised he's the only politician who can deliver good services to Kenyans. Waititu, Speaker of the Senate Ken Lusaka, Governors Mutahi Kahiga (Nyeri) and several other MPs had accompanied DP William Ruto to the event at Karatina Railway grounds.

Kikuyu town MP Kimani Ichungwa said he would not betray Ruto by siding with Kuria. "I will be back here during campaigns and at that time you all know whom I will be pitching for and of course it's not the likes of Moses Kuria," he said.
