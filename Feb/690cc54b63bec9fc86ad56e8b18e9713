Jubilee is not a political outfit for a few people but a national movement, Deputy President William yesterday told critics. He said people should not act like Jubilee was all about him, President Uhuru Kenyatta and some few people. Ruto said the only reason they formed Jubilee was to unite the country and focus on development. He said they did not form the national party so one person can get a certain position. The DP spoke in Bureti, Kericho, during a church fundraiser and the homecoming party for Woman Representative Florence Bore. “I want to help those filling up the newspaper pages with propaganda...I want to give them free information that we did not form Jubilee so that anyone can get any position or some communities can get lost over another,” he said. Ruto said no one has control over who will get what position in the party. The decision will only be made by party members and Kenyans who are voters, he said. “My friends stop wasting your time writing nonsense, we have no time for that. Kenyans want water, roads and jobs.” The DP said he and Uhuru are committed to ensure the Big Four and other pledges are delivered. Present were Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony, Senator Aaron Cheruiyot, MPs Kimani Ichungwa (Kikuyu), Kimani Ngunjiri (Bahati), Japhet Kiptergech (Bureti), several woman representatives and MCAs.
