Authorities have been asked to reign in police officers frustrating a ban on sand collection and charcoal burning in Kitui. Environment and Natural Resources executive John Makau yesterday said some officers were allowing the two activities to take place. “It is unacceptable that police officers who are supposed impose the ban are violating it with impunity,” Makau said. He there was evidence that police were encouraging sand harvesting and charcoal burning. The two activities were banned on January 16 last year. The ban was jointly announced by Governor Charity Ngilu and county commissioner Boaz Cherutich. “We expected police t enforce the ban since it is an initiative of both the national and county governments,” Makau told reporters in Kitui town. On Friday night, police impounded an AP lorry that was found collecting sand at Kanginga River near Mwingi town. The AP driver was arrested by regular police officers after a tip off by residents. The driver will be arraigned tomorrow. ”Other police officers involved in illegal activities should also be arrested to face the law,” Makau said.
