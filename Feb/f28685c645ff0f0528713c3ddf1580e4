Fifth seed Albert Njogu meets Mihaly Dely of Hungary in semi-finals after upsetting top seed Burundi’s Abdoul Shakur Kabura 6-2, 6-4 in the ITF World Tennis tour quarter-final match at the Nairobi Club. The Mbagathi Secondary student started superbly in the first set as he broke Kabura’s serve to win the opener. Kabura was equal to the task and broke Kabura in the next two games to lead 2-1. A revitalised Njogu looked sharp thereafter as he levelled matters in the fourth game and was relentless from then on, pounding several winners to clinch the next four games and the set. Kabura came out fighting in the second set as he matched Njogu’s serves and returns with play going to serve in the opening eight games of the set to be tied at 4-4 . Njogu was able to keep his composure and clinched the fifth game to lead 5-4 and completed the stunning upset win by winning the tenth game to progress to the final four. Njogu expressed his excitement after the win saying: “I was the underdog in this match but I believed in myself and played to my strengths.” High-flying Angela Okutoyi lost to Salma Loudili of Morocco 6-3, 7-5 in the girls’ quarterfinals. Okutoyi had made too many unforced errors in the first set as the North African capitalised on the situation to win the opener. Okutoyi then battled hard in the second set as she matched the Moroccan with play going to serve until the tenth game with scores tied at 5-5. Loudili then broke Okutoyi’s resistance to progress to the semi-finals.
