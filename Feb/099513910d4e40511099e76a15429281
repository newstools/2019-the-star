NDICHU WAINAINA/ Boda boda riders from Mirangine on Thursday rode for 33kms to Ol Kalou town in protest against harassment by county revenue enforcement officers. The 200 riders camped for hours outside Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia’s office. They threatened to abandon their motorcycles and ask the governor for jobs if county officers did not allow them to operate. The enforcement officers want the riders pay the monthly charge of Sh200. The riders have not paid the charge for two years. Mirangine boda boda riders coordinator Francis Ndung’u said they had a deal with the previous administration not to pay taxes until the county provides essential services including toilets and shades. Public administration executive Mbataru Kariuki (above) faulted the riders for protesting outside the governor’s office, saying the grievances were not related to revenue compliance.
