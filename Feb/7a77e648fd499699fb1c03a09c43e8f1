The woman who was arrested and later released on police bond for filming traffic officers harassing a female passenger in Nairobi will be charged with obstruction of justice. In a viral video, Njeri wa Muthoni is seen filming the officers pulling a lady from the front seat of a matatu plying the Kasarani –Nairobi CBD route. Njeri was released on a ten thousand shillings bail and will be arraigned in a Makadara court on Friday. In a charge sheet seen by the Star, she is required to be in court by 8 am. “Received the sum of ten thousand shillings only the aforesaid person being accused on a charge of obstruction in the execution of duty and being required to appear before the Makadara court at 8 am in Nairobi,” read the charge sheet. On Tuesday, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority condemned the arrest adding that they had raised the matter with Kasarani police station. In the clip, five officers are seen trying to eject the lady as Njeri is filming the ordeal. When the officers learnt she was recording, they are seen threatening her but she continued.
