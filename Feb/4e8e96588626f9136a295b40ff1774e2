Every waking minute Tanasha Donna gets, she flies out to visit Diamond Platnumz and spend some quality time with him. Speaking to Word Is, Tanasha said she has tried to get him to come over to her two-bedroom apartment for a visit. "I spend most of my weekends in Diamond's house. I have tried to have him come to my apartment and it has been hard because he has to come with his entourage, which includes security and the whole hullabaloo," she told Word Is. "This means everyone will get to know he is around, and that is what he wants to avoid. I actually got a week off, so I'm here with him. I have not been feeling too well." Tanasha said dating Diamond comes with its pitfalls. Some of them include skirt wearers. “I do feel insecure [dating Diamond]," Tanasha said, "He told me the social media drama I’m facing is nothing compared to his past relationships. But once his fans realise he is indeed serious with our relationship, they will show their support, which I’m already seeing.” Adding, “At the beginning of the relationship, I used to cry daily. I almost fell into depression.” Is their relationship a publicity stunt? “None of it was planned. He approached me. If it was a publicity stunt, how much more publicity can Diamond need? He already has it all," she said. "And if he needed that kind of publicity, he would have chosen a way more famous person, not a normal radio presenter with 80k followers.” Asked if she has talked to Zari about anything at all, Tanasha said, "No, I haven't." She added, "I hope one day we will come to a place of mutual understanding because of the kids. I know this social media and stuff creates unnecessary drama to create a rift between us by comparing us, but one day, God-willing, we shall meet and talk."
