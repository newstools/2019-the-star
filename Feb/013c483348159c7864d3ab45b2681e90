Two human rights organisations in Mombasa have pledged to pursue to a conclusion the mysterious murder of Dandora human rights activist Caroline Mwatha. Haki Africa and Muslims for Human Rights said they will ensure a thorough probe into the death of their colleague, whom they described as a fearless woman and the Dandora community's greatest heroine. The lobby groups said their resolve to defend Kenyans against ills committed by those in authority has been strengthened by Mwatha's death. Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti on Tuesday said Mwatha died trying to procure an abortion. He said six suspects were arrested in connection with the failed abortion. "As Haki Africa, we want to assure the public that Caroline Mwatha's death will not be in vain as we will relentlessly continue to pursue the cause she was fighting for," said Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid.
