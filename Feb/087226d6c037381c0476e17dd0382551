Baringo residents have dismissed claims that they wanted the construction of a road stopped because of too much noise and dust. Last Thursday, the National Environment Management Authority, in a letter to SBI, halted the tarmacking of the 36km Oinonobmoi-Barwessa-Kinyach road. It said residents complained of pollution. The road connects Barwessa, Kaptara and Kinyach to Kabarnet, Eldoret and Nakuru towns. “Residents complained about too much noises and dust from their machines,” director Josiah Nyandoro said on Tuesday. Yesterday, residents were angry and condemned the decision. They wanted the ban lifted. They said the suspension was based on petty, unfounded and uncalled-for grievances. “We pushed the government through a protest to tarmac the road. How then do we complain about such minor consequences accompanying the ongoing process?” asked Joseph Makilap. Andrew Chirchir said the contractor watered the road every morning before work could begin so there was no dust. He added, however, that noise is common everywhere even in areas with no construction. The residents accused MP William Cheptumo of colluding with Nema to stop the project. Cheptumo admitted he called for the suspension to ensure the contractor complies with environmental requirements. “I pushed for a meeting between the SBI, Nema and Kerra so they could discuss how environmental certification can be acquired before proceeding with the works,” he said.
