Wajir East MP Rashid Kassim has hit out at the Kenya National Examination Council for cancelling the results of some students from the region. He said on Saturday the exam agency was hellbent on ruining the lives of Northeastern children. The lawmaker wants the ‘real’ KCSE results released. “How could cheating occur when we saw heavy police presence in and around the examination halls and when the Knec itself assured Kenyans that no exams were leaked?” Kasssim asked. He spoke at Wajir High School during parents’ day. “How many security officers who were guarding the exams have been arrested? How many exam invigilators and monitors have been arrested? How many guys within Knec itself have been arrested for the leaked exams? These questions must be answered.” In December, Knec chairman George Magoha said results for 1,205 candidates were cancelled. Most of them were from Northeastern. He said Knec applied internationally recognised practices to identify cheats. Those affected were allowed to register for this year’s exam. But Kassim said the candidates’ rights were violated. “We’ll not sit down and watch as this happens. This cannot go unchallenged. A group of people sat down and with a stroke a pen cancelled the results of hundreds of our children. Do they really know what the children and their parents are going through?”
