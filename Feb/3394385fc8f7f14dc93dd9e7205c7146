The Law Society of Kenya has cleared Tom Ojienda to contest for the Judicial Service Commission elections after a bitter row over his tax compliance. The LSK Secretary and CEO Mercy Wambua listed the advocate among four other candidates who have submitted their nomination papers for the coming polls. “Pursuant to the call for nominations for the position of the Law Society of Kenya male representative to the Judicial Service Commission, the following candidates have submitted their nomination papers. They include Tom Ojienda, Njeru Macharia,  Ongoto Charles Mongare, Gatundu Alex Irungu, and Irungu Gathii,” Wambua said in the notice. The move comes after KRA awarded an Sh444 million tax bill to Ojienda before they can issue him with a Tax Clearance Certificate just days to the JSC polls.

On December 28 last year, Ojienda was arrested and grilled over a scandal involving Mumias Sugar Company. “The Council of the Law Society of Kenya in its meeting held on Monday, February 11, 2019, considered and accepted the nominations of all the above-mentioned candidates,” LSK said. The society said that they will communicate the details on the upcoming elections once consultations with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission are complete. Last month, Ojienda said DPP Noordin Haji was being used to ensure he is locked out of the JSC polls. He accused the DPP's office of being a rogue institution which was abusing its powers.
