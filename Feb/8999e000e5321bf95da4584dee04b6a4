Slain IEBC IT manager Chris Msando has been awarded ICPS's Posthumous Integrity award in Ghana. Msando was awarded alongside chairman Wafula Chebukati who scooped the Electoral Conflict Management Award during the International Electoral Affairs Symposium and International Electoral Awards. While congratulating Msando, former commissioner Roselyne Akombe said the late Msando deserved the award for his commitment to ensuring electoral integrity in the country. "As they say, a prophet is honoured everywhere except in his own hometown......#RIPMsando. Thanks ICPS and #Ghana for keeping Msando’s legacy alive," Akombe's tweet read. Msando’s award was presented to his wife and son in Ghana. Palestine and Kenya won the Electoral Conflict Management Award while Afghanistan and Mexico bagged the Gender Equality Award at the International Electoral Awards. Musando was found dead in Kikuyu just a week before the hotly contested 2017 general elections. The late Msando was one of the few people with knowledge on the location of IEBC servers. The manager had given Central police station officers reports of death threats. Read: IEBC ICT manager Chris Musando found dead Since then, Investigations into the death have hit a snag.
