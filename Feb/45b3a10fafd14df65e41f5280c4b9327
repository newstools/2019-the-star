Kariobangi Sharks captain Erick Juma is hopeful the Kenyan Premier League title is theirs’ to lose should they replicate their last week’s SportPesa Cup exploits in the remaining rounds of the 2018-2019 season. Sharks punched their way to the inter-country’s tournament podium after edging out compatriots Bandari 1-0 in the final. They had initially mauled the Tanzanian duo of Mbao FC and Yanga in the semis and quarters respectively. The title guarantees them a ticket to host English Premier League side,  Everton in a friendly match later in the year. Juma believes the spirited performance in Tanzania is enough to guarantee them the league title in their third attempt, having missed it in the previous two seasons since their elevation to the top flight in 2017. The versatile midfielder said their main undoing is their inability to collect maximum points against teams deemed as struggling outfits and urged his teammates to rise to the occasion. “We stand a chance of winning the league should as long as we replicate the SportPesa Cup displays in the league,” said Juma. “The teamwork and individual brilliance was commendable and if we put the same in the league, then we will emerge the league champions. It is a dream we have as a team and we hope we will achieve it at the end of the season. The biggest challenge we have is dropping points against ‘small teams’ and the earlier we change this the better.”
