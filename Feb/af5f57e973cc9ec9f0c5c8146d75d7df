Kisii Senator Sam Ongeri yesterday urged Kenyans not to politicise additional responsibilities given to Interior CS Fred Matiang’i by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Ongeri said Uhuru has the prerogative to choose whoever he feels can deliver in various departments as he did in the case of Matiang’i. The former minister in President Moi’s government told the Star by phone that Matiang’i has the ability to chair the National Development Implementation and Communication Cabinet Committee. He said the CS has since demonstrated that he has the capacity to deliver services to Kenyans ”without fear or favour”. “Matiang’i merits heading the committee because his services were felt in the various ministries he served in like Education, Lands and now Interior,” he said. The legislator said the Kisii community is proud that the President recognises sons from the region. He said the country has made strides in terms of development since March last year’s handshake between President Uhuru and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. His statement comes nearly two weeks since Governor James Ongwae led leaders from the region to congratulate the President for the decision. Matiang’i will be monitoring all development projects initiated and funded by the national government.
