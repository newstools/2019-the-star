The county government of Uasin Gishu has imposed a one month ban on the movement of livestock in and out of the county to facilitate smooth vaccination against Foot and Mouth disease. In a letter signed by the acting county director of veterinary service Dr Philip Biamah the quarantine will run from February 4 to March 4. Biamah said Kamagut ward in Turbo constituency has, however, been placed under full quarantine following a confirmed outbreak of FMD. He directed that during the one-month quarantine no animals will be moved in to or out of the county without authorisation from the director of veterinary services, adding that all livestock markets within the county will remain closed during the period. Biamah said samples from several livestock that showed symptoms of the deadly FMD were taken to National Foot and Mouth Disease Referral Lab in Embakasi, Nairobi and the case has been confirmed to be FMD serotype O. He urged all farmers to be alert as they suspect that the disease was brought by illegal businessmen moving animals across the county without permits from unknown sources. He further advised farmers in Kamagut ward that all animal products including milk, meat, hide and skin cannot be taken out of the affected area to control spreading. The letter was also copied to county directors of veterinary services in the neighbouring counties of Nandi, Trans Nzoia, ElgeyoMarakwet, Kericho and Baringo. Click here for the latest political news.
