A police officer in Uasin Gichu has not given up on his music talent, despite serving in the police force for 15 years. Danson Njuguna, popularly known as Kulmax, was born into a humble family of nine in Murang'a. "My mum is Veronica Wahu and my father Abolomon Njuguna," Kulmax said. Kulmax is married with one daughter. He has been interested in the music since childhood but ventured in the industry five years ago when he recorded his debut song. He says real-life daily occurrences inspire him. Kulmax who is is in his mid-30s says he really receives great support from his colleagues in police it really encourages him so much. He now has six songs, which all have videos on YouTube: 'Roho Juu', 'Tunangaa', 'Sema Zii', 'Penzi la Kisoja', 'Kanyagia' and 'Tetemesha'. Kulmax plans to release his latest single, 'Addicted', on Valentine's Day. He has recorded with various Kenyan studios, including Ogopa DJs, Mainswitch, Jomino Entertainment and Bigsouls. "I'm planning to launch my album, 'Penzi la kisoja' by the end of this year," Kulmax said. He says balancing music with police service is not a joke, but it all lies in time management. He would like to work with Khaligraph Jones and Stella Mwangi in future. "To me, they are best artistes in Africa. They help me expand my fanbase," Kulmax said.
