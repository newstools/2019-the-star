Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos has blamed KVDA chief executive David Kimosop for the Sh65 billion hydropower dams scandal. The dams are Arror and Kimwarer. Tolgos wants President Uhuru Kenyatta to ensure that the money lost is recovered. The two dams are expected to make transform the region’s economy. They are also expected to supply water for irrigation to farmlands in Kerio Valley. On Tuesday, Kimosop declined to comment on the issue. Tolgos said he is on record opposing the manner in which the projects were being implemented by the KVDA. The authority, according to him, did not involve stakeholders. “The challenge has been the leadership of Kimosop, whose activities have messed up the successful start of these projects,” the county chief said in a statement on Tuesday. Tolgos said under Kimosop’s leadership, KVDA had been a one-man show. “I’m not the only governor who has raised the red flag on his operations. My West Pokot, Baringo and Turkana counterparts have called for the disbandment of KVDA if Kimosop continues to mismanage the regional authority,” Tolgos said. He said underhand dealings perpetuated by cartels should not cause the projects to stall. “We appeal to the President to ensure the projects proceed once all the culprits are brought to book,” Tolgos said.
