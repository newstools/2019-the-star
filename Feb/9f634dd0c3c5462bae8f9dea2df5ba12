Socialite Bridget Achieng has come out to set the record straight about her baby daddy, whom many have been speculating is white. In a recent Instagram live video, she said: "The dad is light-skinned and he is Nigerian. Even the mother (me) is light-skinned." The Nairobi Diaries reality star, who in past interviews said she spent close to Sh3 million on skin lightening, addressed rumours that socialite Pendo's mzungu ex-lover Joseph Koener was her baby daddy. "Joseph is married to my best friend. My baby is Nigerian," she said. We asked Joseph Koener about his relationship with the new mother of one, and he told Word Is: "Bridget is a good friend to me. I'm a godfather to her baby boy. She is also the best friend to my woman. I recall clearly last year she and my woman merged their birthdays together and in my opinion, she has succeeded in all that she does. She is very trustful and faithful in her ways." Adding: "I only got to meet her after I had met some of the Nairobi Diaries crew, and honestly, she is the only one who is true to herself. She is making a brand out of herself." Joseph, whose engagement to Pendo he termed a stunt, gushed about his new woman. "She is not new. I have known her way before and she was amazing from the beginning. Sharp, smart, loving, humble and very kind," he said. "She chooses not to be in the limelight but enjoy her life on the calm side, that's why I didn't involve her in Pendo's drama at all, but she got to know and she supported me." Bridget recently launched her bleaching cream, known as Magic Lotion.
