Europeans and Americans have been warned against travelling to some parts of Kenya for fear of terrorist attacks. The US government made the announcement yesterday, a move that could hurt the tourism sector and result in diplomatic spats between Nairobi and Washington. Efforts to get comments from Foreign Affairs CS Monica Juma were unsuccessful. She did not return calls or respond to text messages. A security message posted on the US embassy website and shared on its social media platforms put Kenya at travel advisory level two. It urged Westerners to exercise caution. “Credible information indicates Westerners may be targeted by extremists in Nairobi, Naivasha, Nanyuki, and coastal areas of Kenya,” the advisory said. “The US Embassy reminds the public of the continued need for heightened vigilance throughout Kenya, especially in public spaces such as shopping malls, hotels and places of worship. Be aware of your surroundings, and report suspicious activity to authorities immediately, the statement continues cautioning US citizens against visiting locations frequented by tourists or Westerners.” It urged US citizens travelling to or residing in Nairobi to enrol for the Department of State’s Smart Traveller Enrolment Programme. “STEP enrolment gives you the latest security updates and makes it easier for the US embassy or nearest US consulate to contact you in an emergency. If you don’t have Internet access, enrol directly with the nearest US embassy or consulate,” it said. Click here for the latest political news
