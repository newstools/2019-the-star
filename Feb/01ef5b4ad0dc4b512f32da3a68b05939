Nairobi Stima are determined to finish the first leg of Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Super League unbeaten. “The possibility of finishing the first round matches unbeaten is high. We are taking one game at a time and the players are motivated,” said Stima’s assistant coach Evans Mafuta ahead of tomorrow’s clash against relegation-threatened Migori Youth. He said the technical bench led by coach George Owoko has been focusing on tactical approach and rotating players in all their games to avoid fatigue. “We also rotate players because sometimes we play twice a week. Ahead of the game against Migori Youth, we have a fully fit squad and we have prepared them for the game. We are going for maximum points because this league is becoming very competitive,” he added. Stima are third on the log with 28 points—five behind leaders Wazito. Ushuru-coached by Ken Kenyatta will hope to regain the lead albeit temporarily when the tax men host Coast Stima at Ruaraka grounds. Fourth-placed Talanta tackle Kangemi All Stars while Shabana will look to return to winning ways with a fixture against bottom of the table Green Commandos at Gusii Stadium as from 4pm. On Wednesday, the former top flight side lost 2-1 against Fortune Sacco. Stuttering Eldoret Youth hosts Fortune Sacco at Eldoret Sports ground. On Monday, log leaders, Wazito will be up against host Thika United in the second of a double header. In the first game, Bidco United host Kenya Police. Kisumu All Stars entertain Modern Coast Rangers as Francis Oduor target a top three finish in the first leg.
