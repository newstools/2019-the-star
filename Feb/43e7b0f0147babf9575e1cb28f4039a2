Martha*(not her real name), a 13-year-old girl in Samburu County got her first menstrual cycle two years ago. She has, however, never seen a sanitary pad. Martha’s story resonates with at least 65 per cent of girls and women in the country, who, according to World Bank, cannot afford a steady supply of sanitary pads. A 2016 report by Unesco revealed one out of 10 girls in sub-Saharan Africa miss school every day due to lack of sanitary pads. The government allocated Sh470 million towards purchase of sanitary towels for schoolgoing girls in the last financial year. This year, nothing. Early this week, a local newspaper revealed that two former speakers of National Assembly and a Chief Justice are pushing the exchequer to increase their pension. The three, Francis ole Kaparo, Ekwe Ethuro (Senate) and former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga are demanding that their pension is raised to Sh1.6 million each per month from the current Sh554,000 and Sh637,386 respectively. They also want Sh300,000 fuel allowance and a lumpsum of Sh24 million each among other niceties. Taxpayers will have to incur at least Sh72 million to settle the lumpsum and another Sh72 million in total monthly pension in one year. This means Treasury has to spare at least Sh150 million in one year to give them a golden handshake. A 2014 study by the British Journal of Medicine and Medical Research indicated that a woman uses at least 17,000 sanitary pads in her lifetime. A standard packet of sanitary pads in local stores contains eight pieces, retailing at Sh80. This means, 17,000 pieces are equal to 2,125 packets worth Sh170, 000. Considering that Sh170,000 is enough to buy a single girl enough sanitary pads to last her through to menopause, Sh150 million demanded by the three former civil servants can buy 882 girls sanitary pads throughout their lifespan. Kitui county, where the former chief justice hails from, has devoted Sh2.9 billion —30 per cent of its budget —to health. According to the county chief officer Richard Muthoka, Sh70 million will be used to buy equipment and Sh400 million spent on medicines and other non-pharmaceuticals. With the Sh150 million demanded by Mutunga and the former speakers, Kitui county could easily double hospital equipment budgeted for this financial year. The amount can for instance buy the county 48 dialysis machines or purchase 10 million malaria drugs. Kaparo’s car demands only amounts to at least Sh11.6 million. This amount accounts for nearly 80 per cent what his home county of Kajiado has set aside this year to support youth and women economic ventures. The demand for more pension perks by the three leaders perhaps illustrates how the gap between the poor and the rich continues to widen in Kenya.
