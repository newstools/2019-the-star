French President Emmanuel Macron will make a two-day State visit to Kenya mid-March. French Ambassador Aline Kuster-Menager, on Monday confirmed that the French President will visit the country when she paid a courtesy call on President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi. Uhuru said he looked forward to hosting the French President and expects the visit to break new ground in the bilateral relations between Kenya and France. “Traditionally, Kenya and France enjoy strong bilateral ties and I am pleased that we've continued to deepen the relations. I look forward to the visit by President Macron,” he said. During Macron's visit, Kenya and France are expected to sign several agreements and MoUs covering various subjects of mutual interest between the two countries. The proposed rapid transit train service between Nairobi Central Business District and the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport is among projects expected to feature prominently when Uhuru hosts the French leader in Nairobi. Early this month, Uhuru hosted DRC President Felix Tshisekedi for a two-day official visit that focused on areas of mutual interest and cooperation with a particular emphasis on the role of infrastructure in development on the continent. The two leaders agreed to deepen trade ties and partnering in areas of mutual benefit. Click here for the latest political news
