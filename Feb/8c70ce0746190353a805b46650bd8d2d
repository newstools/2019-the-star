Various services in Nairobi have been paralysed as the standoff between county workers and the Salaries and Remuneration Commission continues. A spot check by the Star yesterday at the City Mortuary showed that only a few morgue attendants had resumed work. The others had joined the strike, now in its second day. Street sweepers and parking attendants were nowhere to be seen and so were drainage workers and gardeners. The Kenya County Government Workers’ Union (KCGWU) chairman Samuel Muguiri condemned employees who have reported for duty despite the agreement to boycott work. “We are here to tell those workers who are locked inside City Hall offices to stop being traitors and come out to join us,” Muguiri said. The manual workers had assembled outside City Hall.
