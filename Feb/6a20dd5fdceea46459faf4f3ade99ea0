Nandi Governor Stephen Sang and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi have sustained attacks on Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, vowing to "cut him down to size" before the 2022 election. The legislators, allied to Deputy President William Ruto, said they are not scared of Joho. Last week, Joho sued Sang and Sudi for linking him to drug trafficking in the Coast region. "We will not be scared even if he goes to court. We will fight him left, right and centre...," Sudi said. The MP said he would expose "details on how Joho and his companies had been involved in tax evasion". The two legislators took a swipe at Joho on Sunday during a church function in Cheptiret, Uasin Gishu county. Joho has denied being involved in drug trafficking and tax evasion and has dared the legislators to prove their allegations in court. He accused Ruto of using Sang and his team to to fight him at the Coast. On February 5, Sang, MP Kimani Ichungwah (Kikuyu) and Sudi were been summoned to appear in court for linking Joho to drug trafficking.

The three legislators are said to have claimed that Joho’s name was in a list tabled in Parliament by then Internal Security minister George Saitoti in 2010. The list of six names was allegedly in a US embassy dossier, which then US ambassador Michael Ranneberger had given to the then Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission.
