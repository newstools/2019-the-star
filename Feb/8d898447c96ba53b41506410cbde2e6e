Strathmore University open their 2019 Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) women’s Premier League campaign against Jomo Kenyatta University of Agricultural and Technology (JKUAT) on March 3 as they seek to return to the Africa Club Championship. The students finished third behind holders Telkom and second placed United States International Africa last season hence failing to feature the Africa Club Championship in Nigeria in December. Strathmore coach Meshack Senge is optimistic this season will be better. “We would love to return to the Africa Club championship this year and this can only be achieved if we do well in the league. We, therefore want to start all over again and as always, first games of every season are important and it’s always safe if you start with a win,” observed Senge. He added: “More so, we are keen to challenge for the KHU titles. Last year, we had a lukewarm season and we lost some games we shouldn’t have. This time around, we just want to play well and win games. We are aware it’s not going to be easy but we will put our best foot forward and hopefully, results will come our way.” In the newly released fixture by the union, USIU-A men will battle Parklands in the only men’s Premier League match of the weekend at the City Park Stadium, while Parkroad Badgers will take on KCAU in the Super League match. On March 2, Gorilla play Mt Kenya University, JKUAT crosswords with Parkroad Tigers as Thika Rovers battle Karate Axiom in the men’s National League. In the women’s Super League, relegated Vikings will start new life in the lower tier with match against Multimedia University before the students return to take on new comers Oranje Leonas in their second match of the day. In the only men’s Super League match of the day, Technical University of Kenya will line up against MMU.
