Three policemen are among eight suspects arrested in connection to a burglary that happened in a warehouse in Nairobi’s Industrial Area on Sunday afternoon. They are Philip Thuo attached to Tassia Police Post in Embakasi, Joseph Mwongela of Marich Police Station in West Pokot and Embakasi DCI’s Shadrack Mumo. The officers and their five accomplices were nabbed before leaving the Philips East Africa Limited godown along Enterprise Road where they had allegedly stolen several cartons of energy saver light bulbs. The suspects were intercepted by Industrial Area Police Station commander Henry Kandie and an undercover team from the station. They waved a police pocket phone and indicated they were police officers when they were cornered at the gate. The three were in the company of private guards Simon Ongori and Martin Otambu both from Securex Limited. The other suspects are Wycliff Chanyi, Daniel Ngonzi and David Mwaniki, who was driving their escape car. The vehicle, a Toyota Probox, and the cargo were towed to the station where they are kept as exhibits. Nairobi police commander Philip Ndolo yesterday said the suspects will be charged in 24 hours. Ndolo said he was not aware of the details of the charges to be pressed against the eight as they were with investigators.
