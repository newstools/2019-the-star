A burial ceremony of a prominent business man Peter Zablon in Mt Elgon on Sunday turned chaotic after MP Fred Kapondi exchanged blows with his bitter rival Evans Kiprotich. The duo took on each other after their supporters clashed when Kapondi was making his speech. The fracas broke out after Masuti Chemasuet, a close confidant of Kiprotich stood to take some photos on his phone while Kapondi was addressing the gathering. Supporters of Kapondi spotted Chemasuet and descended on him with heavy blows and kicks. The supporters of his rival dashed to rescue one of their own before the entire compound was turned into a war ground. Kapondi's supporters roughed Chemasuet and demanded that he deletes the photos, an issue the latter would not heed to. As a result the funeral was cut short as mourners scampered for safety.

However Kapondi defended his move saying it was Kiprotich and his supporters to blame for the fracas. "Why should they disrupt me when I am talking. Why should they take my photos without my consent," the legislator paused. Kapondi claimed that Kiprotich wanted to post the photos on social media with an intention of spoiling his name. Kiprotich in his response said the MP had acted silly for starting the fight. "A funeral is a public gathering and there was no need for the war. If the MP didn't want his photos taken then why did he come in the first place," Kiprotich said. Click here for the latest political news
