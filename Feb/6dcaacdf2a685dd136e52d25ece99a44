Former Jubilee vice-chairman David Murathe says many popular were rigged out during Jubilee’s 2017 nominations. He said on Tuesday that a team was hell-bent on imposing its preferred candidates on voters. Murathe told Citizen TV in an interview that it was from the shambolic primaries that his woes with the DP began. “Some interested parties rigged out highly popular people, especially from Mt Kenya, and planted the people they wanted,” he said. “A lot of people were left out. I watched it and was seething inside, but there was nothing I could do about it.” DP William Ruto spearheaded the primaries. On the first day, the exercise was cancelled. It was mired in confusion and chaos. It resumed the following day. Murathe’s latest admission is likely to open a pandora’s box, a situation that could worsen the already strained relations within the party. Some politicians dismissed Murathe’s claims, saying he should not speak now because he did nothing to stop or prevent it. “Murathe confirms they rigged nominations. What a shame washing dirty linen in public,” former Kiambu Governor William Kabogo said. Kabogo and former Nairobi governor candidate Peter Kenneth had blamed the DP for their failures. Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika said Murathe has been “playing harlotry” endorsing many people to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta. “Why didn’t he spew that nonsense before the 2017 election? He is going round endorsing others for the presidency,” she said via Twitter. Asked why he did not intervene, Murathe said the focus was on winning the election. “We still believed those affected would live to overcome. Most of them have been appointed to various positions in government.” He maintained that they will oppose Ruto’s candidacy.
