A quarry worker was killed yesterday after an explosive blew up in Kinamba, Naivasha. Colleagues escaped unhurt. The explosive is believed to have been set up in the mine. Jackson Mathenge said it was normal to use explosives to break down boulders which are later turned into building stones. He said it was unclear what triggered the explosion. “The man was cut into pieces. He died instantly,” Mathenge said. The body was moved to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital Mortuary. Two weeks ago, a man was crushed to death by a boulder in a quarry near Maraigushu area in Naivasha. Elsewhere, residents of Longonot in Naivasha have called for improved security following the killing of an 82-year-old man and a boda boda rider. Speaking during the burial of Absolom Mburu, residents claimed the two were killed by herders from neighbouring counties. The boda boda rider was murdered two weeks ago and his motorcycle stolen. Mburu, a farmer, was killed last week and his cattle and sheep were stolen. Pastor Peter Thuku said it was a cause for worry that no arrests have been made. He said herders seeking pasture for their livestock have invaded the area leading to conflict between with farmers. “We suspect the herders have been involved and we are asking police to intervene before more lives are lost,” Thuku said.
