In a bid to avoid previous problems with national teams’ kit, the National Olympic Committee of Kenya have begun early engagement with clothing giant Nike ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Nock held a consultative meeting yesterday with Nike’s Robert Lotwis to initiate early discussion on the Kenyan kit for Tokyo 2020. In run down to the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia, there was a stand-off between athletes and officials as far as team’s kit is concerned. Nock Committee, led by the President Paul Tergat, informed Nike that the aspect of kit is a critical element to the preparations and participation of  Team Kenya in the future events. “The Committee is committed to ensuring that this time round Kenya will be adequately kitted. The meeting is timely as Nock wants to start early preparations on all aspects ahead of the Olympic Games especially adequate and timely provision of the Athletes kit,” observed Tergat. He at the same time updated Lotwis on the developments in NOC-K and the current ongoing digitisation of the stores to ensure all stocks received are well accounted for and there is complete product trail to the final stage of issuance to the athletes. On other hand, Lotwis assured Nock of full support and engagement towards the preparations to ensure the process was smooth and extremely beneficial to all the stakeholders. The Nike representative expressed satisfaction with the handling of the Nike kit so far and hoped that it would be maintained and enhanced. Other items that were discussed in the meeting included the review of the 2018 provision and Nock expressed gratitude to Nike for kitting teams to the Commonwealth Games, African Youth Games and Youth Olympics.
