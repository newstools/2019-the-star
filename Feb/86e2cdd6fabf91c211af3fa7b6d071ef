A nurse working with Amref-Kenya who was reported missing on Thursday has been found in Mombasa after a three-day search. Margaret Wanjala Kilelu was found admitted at Coast Provincial General Hospital (CPGH) Intensive Care Unit. Kilelu was last seen walking out of Tena estate in Nairobi. How she got to Mombasa is still a puzzle. CPGH chief administrator, Dr Iqbal Khandwalla, said Kilelu was brought to the institution on Friday by a good samaritan. "She is a patient in our hospital. She was brought on Friday from a private hospital in Kisauni," Khandwalla said. He said doctors carried out several tests; including a CT Scan and administered medications, and that she is now in good  condition. He said preliminary assessment revealed she might have a blood infection. “She has really improved and in stable condition, but she cannot talk. She will need to undergo tests to find out if she was intoxicated or poisoned,” Khandwalla said. Family members said Kilelu was found by a good samaritan near a petrol station in Bamburi and reported to Kadzandani police station. The police and the good Samaritan took her to hospital. “After we reported her disappearance on Thursday and her photo went viral on social media, we got information on Sunday that she had been found admitted at Coast General Mombasa,” Lydia Opiyo, a close family member said. “The CT scans did not reveal anything. The doctors have now taken out some blood samples and we are waiting for the results. They will also check if she was raped or drugged,” she said. Her brother, Chrispin Chombo, is the one taking care of her at the hospital. Mercy Kilelu, her sister, said they are waiting for more details from Mombasa. “I’m currently in Nairobi. Our brother is the one taking care of her,” she said.
