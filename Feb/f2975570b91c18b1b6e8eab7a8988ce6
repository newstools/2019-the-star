FC Talanta coach Abdalla Juma has appealed to Football Kenya Federation to consider punishing officials who collude with clubs to fix National Super League matches. Several clubs plying their trade in the second tier have recently expressed discontent with the levels of officiating and Talanta claim to be the latest victims after their 1-0 loss to Nairobi Stima on Wednesday. Juma alleged they were on the receiving end of biased officiating in the 1-0 loss—an outcome he attributed to match officials conniving to openly favour the home side. The match staged at Karuturi grounds saw Stima condemn Talanta to their second loss of the season to push them to fourth on the log with 21 points, putting their promotion quest in jeopardy as they trail leaders Ushuru by eight points. Juma claimed that his side was denied clear penalties and had his centre half Gedion Were sent off unfairly. He questioned the number of controversial calls made against them and an alleged dubious penalty awarded to the power men. The former Chemelil Sugar boss now wants the federation to punish whistle blowers implicated in cases of biased officiating with immediate effect. He noted that the two losses his side had suffered this far in the season were engineered by rogue officials whom he labelled as unprofessional. “I appeal to the federation to punish refs who collude with certain clubs to rob matches. It was evident against Nairobi Stima and this contributed to our loss. It’s embarrassing such things are happening in modern football and it’s high time action is taken against officials found guilty.”
