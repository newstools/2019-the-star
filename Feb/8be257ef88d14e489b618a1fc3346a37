The girlfriend of freed businessman Joseph Kori will have to wait until Monday to take plea for her murder charge. Judy Wangui and another suspect, car hire businessman Micheal Mathenge, appeared before High Court judge Christine Meoli in Kiambu on Tuesday afternoon but the plea-taking was postponed. It was deferred after Wangui's lawyer Cliff Ombeta failed to attend court. Counsel Doreen Kali, holding brief for Ombeta, informed the court that they had planned to attend court tomorrow (Wednesday) as directed by the lower court. She said the court was to mention the case for closure of the miscellaneous file which had been granted for extension of more days for completion of investigations into the murder of Kori's wife Mary Wambui.

He said he needed time to familiarise himself with the matter. Ombutu appealed to the court to allow the two suspects to be remanded at Muthaiga police station due to the proximity to the court. The prosecution led by Christine Mbevi were not opposed to the deferring of the case. However, the prosecution sought to have the first suspect remanded at Muthaiga police station and the second suspect at Pangani police station. Justice Meoli said she will be away from the court from tomorrow and the plea should be taken on Monday next week when it is her criminal cases day. Last week, Kori was released from police custody due to lack of evidence to charge him. Click here for the latest political news
