The Council of Governors chairman Wycliffe Oparanya has advised Kirinyaga leaders to unite to make the forth coming devolution conference a success. The event will be held at the Kirinyaga University a success. Speaking at the KTI grounds when he was hosted by Governor Anne Waiguru to check on the progress of preparation for the forum, Oparanya said he was impressed with the preparation. The Kakamega county boss who was with his vice chairman and Muranga Senator Mwangi Wairia said it was through Waiguru's intense lobbying that saw Kirinyaga given the honour to host the conference. ''These forum comes with a lot of benefits to the economy and growth of the people, people of Kirinyaga will see those benefits, you may not witness another conference for even after 50 years, your governor really lobbied,'' Oparanya said. The CoG chairman said the theme of the forum will be based on President Uhuru Kenyatta's Big Four agenda which include Universal Health Care, affordable housing, food security and manufacturing. Oparanya said the devolved units are working hand in hand with the national government to make devolution Kenya's success story. He further said governors are working on how they can integrate the big four agenda into the devolved units.
