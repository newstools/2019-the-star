The Kisumu county government will hire nurses on temporary basis following the nurses' strike. A statement by the Governor's Press Unit on Saturday said the department of health will immediately deploy the nurses. "The department  is calling upon qualified nurses willing to locum to urgently report to Kisumu County Hospital with credentials for immediate deployment," reads the statement. "This situation obtaining in Kisumu county must be redressed with the rights of the patients in mind." The statement comes a day after Governor Anyang' Nyong'o directed the nurses to go back to work as their matter was being handled by the national government and Council of Governors. Nyong'o directed the nurses to go back to their work stations by 4pm on Friday or face unspecified consequences. Nurses had defied court orders and vowed to continue with the strike until their demands are met. The strike was suspended for 60 days to allow for negotiations. The court issued the orders after the Council of Governors sought an injunction. KNUN deputy secretary general Maurice Opetu on Wednesday dismissed the court orders, saying the strike will continue.
