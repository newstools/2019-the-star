People who actively practice religion may be happier than the rest, according to a new study. A Pew Research study analyzed survey data from more than two dozen countries to compare the self-reported lifestyles of religious and non-religious people. Overall, the researchers found actively religious people tend to be happier, though they aren’t necessarily healthier in terms of exercise or obesity rates. While the link between religion and health may not have been so clear, the findings on self-reported happiness are ‘striking,’ the researchers say. The study broke religious participation down to three categories are: Actively religious (regular participation), ‘inactively religious’ (claim a religious but attend services infrequently), and ‘religiously unaffiliated’ (people who do not identify with any religion). More than a third of actively religious adults in the US (36 per cent) described themselves as ‘very happy’ in the surveys, compared to a quarter of both inactive and unaffiliated Americans. In another example, 45 per cent of actively religious Australians said they were very happy, while just 32 per cent of inactive reported this, and 33 per cent of the unaffiliated. ‘And, there is no country in which the data show that actives are significantly less happy than others (though in many countries, there is not much of a difference between the actives and everyone else),’ the researchers note. Religious people may also tend to make healthier lifestyle choices, often reporting that they smoke and drink less than non-religious people. But, this doesn’t necessarily make for better overall self-reported health, the study found. The findings are part of a growing body of research that suggests religious participation has a positive effect on those who actively pursue it. A separate study published last fall found that religion can help to lessen feelings of loneliness. Click here for the latest political news.
