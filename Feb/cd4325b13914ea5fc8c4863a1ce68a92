Mijikenda elders in Kilifi have rejected a state-approved Giriama book for teaching local language in Early Childhood Development. They call it substandard. The Malindi District Cultural Association said the book Nahufurahie Kigiriama will not build the language. It was written by Samson Kahindi and launched by author Ngugi wa Thiong’o at Pwani University in Kilifi two weeks ago. The elders said some parts of the language are written in Kiswahili and will “have negative repercussions on future generations”. MDCA secretary Karisa Mwarandu and Giriama poet Edward Kazungu said they will sue to have the book replaced. “We’ll ensure the book is not taken to schools,’’ Mwarandu said.
