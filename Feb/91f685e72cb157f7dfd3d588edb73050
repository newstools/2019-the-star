Good Morning. Today, we take you inside the multi-billion internal heist that led to the collapse of Chase Bank, now SBM Bank (Kenya). The Central Bank of Kenya has accused the Judiciary of stalling efforts to recover Sh14.9 billion lost in internal loan fraud that saw Chase Bank collapse in April 2016. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Monday morning. Fresh details emerge on the loan fraud that collapsed chase bank Former Chase Bank Kenya chairman Zafrullah Khan had awarded himself a three-year consultancy contract for an unspecified project for the bank, 16 months before it sunk on April 7, 2016. A special audit report by Deloitte released a month after CBK placed the corporate aligned lender into receivership shows the man at the centre of Sh14.9 billion internal bank heist was to earn a whopping $50,466 (Sh5.15 million) per month. When the Star sought to know from him the kind of consultancy he was offering the bank until April 2016, the 62-year-old fumbled before hanging up. _____________________________________________________ On bloody feet, lost boys recall the journey to Kakuma Refugee Camp In a poorly lit inner room in his studio, John Chejang’ sat on a red stool, his left fingers tightly gripping the right. His piercing eyes gazed somewhere in the air, completely oblivious of our presence. Chejang’ belongs to the lost boys of Sudan, a name given to displaced boys during the Second Sudanese Civil War (1987–2005) in which about two million were killed. He was among the first refugees to arrive at Kakuma Refugee Camp 26-years-ago, as a young boy orphaned by the war. “As a refugee, you only live for today. You decide to either live with the bad here or go for worse in South Sudan,” he said. _____________________________________________________ KPC audit query exposes possible loss of Sh5.1bn Taxpayers could have lost in excess of Sh5.1 billion at the graft-ridden Kenya Pipeline Company in the financial year ending June 30 last year. This was revealed in Auditor General Edward Ouko’s report exposing the rot in the firms’ operations. The queries arise from an undeclared debt owed to an oil marketing company; incomplete electronic budget system, and pending contract claims among other accounting issues. _____________________________________________________ Al Shabaab resilience, diplomatic row muddle troop withdrawal from Somalia The ongoing withdrawal of troops from Somalia is raising concerns of a security vacuum that a resurgent al Shabaab will exploit. The African Union Mission in Somalia was initially meant to deploy with 8,000 troops for just six months in 2007. However, it has had its mandate consistently renewed and expanded. Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Djibouti and Burundi have since jointly contributed 22,000 troops. Now they are trying to scale back and hand control to a fledgling Somali government and ill-equipped military. _____________________________________________________ Meeting called as row over guns for watchmen deepens The row pitting security stakeholders in regard to issuing guns to private guards deepened yesterday after a private security workers union said the plan should not be delayed. The Kenya National Private Security Workers Union dismissed assertions by the state regulator suggesting that watchmen cannot be assigned guns until the law is amended. Isaac Andabwa, the union secretary general, told the Star yesterday that the plan to arm guards has been taken out of context. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
