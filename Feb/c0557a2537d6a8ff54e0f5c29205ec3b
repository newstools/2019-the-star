Geothermal Development Company (GDC) has commenced phase one steam drilling in Baringo targeting an additional 3,000 megawatts (MW) to the national power grid. GDC North Rift regional manager John Lagat said the ongoing phase one well-drilling process at the Paka hills in East Pokot kicked off in December last year and may take at least 60 to 90 days to complete. “After which, the company shall shift its energies in the second and third phase respectively to drill some other 15 to 20 wells at Korosi, Silale and Paka to the tune of Sh8 billion. The process may take over 20 years” Lagat said.
