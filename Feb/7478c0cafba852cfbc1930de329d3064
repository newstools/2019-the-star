Martin Rwamba/ Pumpkin farmers in Embu are looking for market after their first bumper harvest. Commercial pumpkin farming was introduced in October last year. More than 30 farmers, mainly from Embu East, said they invested heavily but have nowhere to sell their produce. Karurumo Pumpkin Farmers Association chairperson Lewis Waweru on Sunday said they bought one seed at Sh300 from a man who went to the area last year. The man, whom he did not name, promised to help them find a ready market. He disappeared. They hoped to get Sh50 per kilo. One pumpkin can weigh up to 10kg. Waweru said he has 10 tonnes and has not sold a single pumpkin. “I invested Sh300,000.” Waweru said they travelled to Tanzania to look for a market but were unsuccessful. Farmer Lewis Njue has five tonnes in his store. “I am here daily sorting those which are rotting,” Njue said.
