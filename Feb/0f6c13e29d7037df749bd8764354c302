Human rights lawyer Willie Kimaniâ€™s murder case will resume on Monday when an officer who had been stood down will continue with his testimony. The testimony by the said police officer is meant to link the suspects to the killing of Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri. Kennedy Mwadime is expected to finish giving his evidence before the prosecution stands him down. In the case, officer Fredrick Leliman was charged alongside his colleagues Leonard Maina, Stephen Chebulet, Sylvia Wanjiku and police informer Peter Ngugi. After Mwadime is done giving his testimony, the prosecution will play a video believed to be a confession clip by one of the suspects admitting how they plotted to kill the three victims. The defence will also be supplied with copies of the confession clip, which the prosecution intends to play in court on that day. Before Mwadime was stood down, he had shown video evidence of how a radio phone belonging to the key suspect Lelimani moved around on that specific date. Mwadime further explained to Justice Jessie Lessit how police radios are tracked at the Integrated Command Centre. He said the investigations showed the radio was at Syokimau police post on June 23, between 12.20pm and 12.40pm.
