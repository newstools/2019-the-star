Publishing company Jomo Kenyatta Foundation has urged the government to reintroduce Primary Mathematics textbooks. The publishing firm that once dominated the textbook business was famous for Primary Mathematics. The book had a signature illustration on the cover of a boy and a girl climbing a stairway. JKF acting chairman Mohammed Jabane said this will enable the foundation support needy students through their scholarship programme. Yesterday the foundation awarded 155 scholarships to needy students who passed last year’s KCPE exams. The Foundation is sponsoring 300 students in secondary school. The scholarship is worth Sh29.2 million. “This is a social kind of business where proceeds from our book sale go to supporting students who have done well in their exams but cannot pay for their education. We ask the ministry to reconsider revival of our flagship Primary Mathematics textbooks to support our agenda due to diminishing book market,” Jabane said. Any child who schooled in the 1990s and early 2000 came across the book. The book industry was liberalised in the 1990s.
