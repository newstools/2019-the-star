An advocate of the High Court was today arraigned at Kibera for allegedly stealing Sh 6 million from the account of Sale Processing Safety Company. The accused Festus Murimi who is a co-director of said company, however, did not take a plea. Kibera magistrate Boaz Ombewa declined an application by the state investigators to detain him for six more days to allow for further investigations. While making his judgement, the magistrate released the advocate on a bond of Sh1 million with a surety of similar amount but with no bond terms. He said that the state did not give strong reasons as to why the accused should not be released on bond adding that he can be out while the investigations are ongoing for justice to prevail. According to the court documents, the accused on February 15 2019, reported the matter of his forceful abduction at Kileleshwa Police station claiming that the abductors forced him to withdrew 60,000 USD from the account of KCB bank based at Sarit Centre Nairobi.
