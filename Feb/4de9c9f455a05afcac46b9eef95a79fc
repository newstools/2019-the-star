A fire has destroyed part of Mt Kenya National Park in Tharaka-Nithi county. Senior warden Isaac Mugo told the Star on Tuesday the fire, which is spreading, began on Saturday. "The flames are spreading fast because of the strong winds in the region. The fire has moved up the mountain," he said. Mugo said they have dispatched choppers to put out the fire. "We are hopeful that we will be able to put it out by the end of the day," he added. The cause of the fire is not known. The Kenya Forest Service warns residents near Mt Kenya and the Aberdare Forest against lighting fires that could become devastating wildfires. It is a lie that burning forests brings rains and fires cause massive destruction that take ages to recover, conservators said. The risk of forest fires is at its highest during the prolonged drought. In 2017, more than 17,000 acres of forest were destroyed by fire in the Aberdares. Click here for the latest news
