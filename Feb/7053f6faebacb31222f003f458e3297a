Controversial singer Akothee says she was once sexually assaulted by a top leader, when she was struggling to make ends meet. "In 2005, I went looking for a job, even if it's a sweeper, in a minister's office. I had met him through a friend — we go to church together," she said. "The last day after going there for a week, I finally got to see him about 8 pm, when everyone had left, 'cause he asked me to stay behind! I came in and told him my story and gave him my form four certificate, 'cause that’s all I had. "We went into his Mercedes Benz. At about the roundabout of Integrity Centre, he took his ugly fat hands and put them on my thighs, pulling my dress up.
