Contractors in Siaya have been directed to complete all projects by June to ensure no rollovers into the next financial year. Ugunja subcounty administrator Vincent Oduor said the order was in line with Governor Cornel Rasanga’s directive. Oduor said the county wants all all programmes completed on schedule so that others do not stagnate. “Pending bills and project rollovers have created confusion among participants during various sensitisation and civic education meetings,” Oduor said. He was addressing a public participation meeting for the county budget making process for the 2019-20 financial year at Ugunja. He said locational project management committees have been asked to ensure that projects are undertaken according to schedule. “We’ve decided to change tack because it is the committees who know the best quality of the work they proposed,” he said. Residents said they were being ambushed with projects they did not propose during public participation. Oduor said locals must have a say on what projects they want. He said contractors must also give them first priority during implementation. “Locals must be considered for both skilled and non-skilled jobs including the usage of locally available resources,” he said.
