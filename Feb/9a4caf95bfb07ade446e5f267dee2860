At least 2,500 private developers claiming ownership of Kenya Airports Authority land risk losing their money. The Mlolongo Brothers Association and Uungani Settlement Scheme Self-Help Group claim ownership of land where Jomo Kenyatta International Airport stands. KAA in documents obtained by the Star say the two little-known organisations of hiving off part of its land. During the hearing at the National Lands Commission’s Annex Bishop offices, land commissioners were shocked to learn KAA had lost 11,551 acres of JKIA land. Some parcels are on flight paths. KAA in the documents said the officials of Mlolongo Brothers Association, Peter Muinde Mbiti (chairperson), Agnes Njeri (vice chairperson), James Njoroge Murigi, Solomon Mwau, Stephen Mwania, Dominic Katua misrepresented the public. KAA said the association told the public that it owned LR No 24937 and was in the process of subdividing it for allocation to its members. Following the announcement that the parcel was up for sale, several people expressed interest.

The association with1,642 members said its objectives are to start income-generating activities andeducate members on poverty eradication, and HIV-Aid awareness. KAA provides services such as check-in guidelines, passport control, immigration, visas and security regulations. It has a presence at JKIA, Kisumu, Eldoret andMoi international airports and Wilson Airport. During the hearing, KAA said allocations were made “on top of their existing title” and they are illegal. In total, 118 parcels were under probe by NLC. The Mlolongo Brothers Association said they applied in March 1986 for allotment of LR No 13512. However, learnt it was part of LR NO 3864, part of which was given to KAA by government. The association said they later learnt the original L.R No had been given to Douglas Wason, a white settler, for farming had partly been compulsorily acquired by government. Their allotment letter turned out to be fake,the documents show. Even as KAA was putting up a spirited fight against Mlolongo Brothers Association, another group sprang up, armed with an allotment letter. The Uungani Settlement Self-Help Group emerged with an allotment letter dated January 5, 1998, and signed by FG Mwangi. The group claimed a parcel LR No 14231. The allotment letter said that unsurveyed agricultural plot B within Mavoko municipality had been allocated to them. Uungani Settlement Self-Help Group chairperson David Mila said LR No 14231 was owned by Douglas before the government compulsorily acquired it.

Mila said they had interest in part of the land that had reverted back to the government. In 1990s, they sought help from a councillor who later introduced them to former Embakasi MP David Mwenje. Uungani raised Sh360,000 which was given to Mwenje with a view to obtaining an allotment letter. The politician advised them to have one group registered, have a constitution and open bank account, which they did. The group said it had paid all the standard premiums in respect of the parcel. The group, according to copies of receipts of payment, paid Sh804,445 November 22, 2002. The receipts also show that they paid Sh200,000 on November 26, 2002, before paying another Sh1,123,125 on December 4,2002. The group further paid Sh1,039,800 on December 3, 2002. In 2004, Uungani advertised that they were in the process of selling land, compelling KAA to obtain a court injunction. Shocked by the turn of events, KAA wrote to then Commissioner of Land Judith Okungu for an explanation. KAA is adamant that the two groups are part of the illegal settlers that must be removed. The Authority said Kyang’ombe and Syokimau area whose LR No is 21919 measures 11,550.9366 acres is their land under the lease from the government. “In the meeting in your offices on October 27, 2005, we apprised you of the claims on ownership to part of L.R No 21919 (the parcel on which JKIA is situated) by two groups namely Mlolongo Brothers and Uungani Settlement Self-Help Group,”a letter dated November 8,2005, referenced KAA/1105/530, said.
