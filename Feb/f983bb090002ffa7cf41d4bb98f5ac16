Mwamba RFC coach Kevin Wambua has hailed the impact of Kenya Sevens’ star Collins Injera as they aim for the Kenya Cup play-offs at the end of the season. Injera scored a hat-trick in their 26-13 win over Blak Blad over the weekend, a result that leaves them fifth on the log with 27 points—one point behind fourth placed Nondies and four adrift of third-placed Quins. Wambua said he is delighted with Injera’s performance in recent matches. “He has shown leadership on and off the pitch and is creating and scoring tries for his teammates,” he added. Mwamba lost their opening three fixtures but have bounced back—winning the next five out of six games to move up the log. “Everyone had written us off in the early part of the season but the boys have shown character to get back to winning ways,” he added Wambua said they were aiming for higher seeding and believes they can overtake Nondies who are in fourth on the log. “We have momentum. Apart from the Kabras defeat, we are playing well and can improve for the remainder of the season,” he noted. Wambua said the race for the playoffs will be tough with Nondies , Mwamba, Homeboyz and Impala chasing the three available spots. “ I think it will go down to the last game of the group phase. It’s quite competitive between the four teams and the margin for error is small.” Mwamba face Mean Machine next and Wambua has noted that the match will be tricky. “They are fighting to stay up in the league and we are chasing play-off position. so can’t underestimate them and we must be at our best if we are to win the game,” added Wambua.
