Good Morning. Former Jubilee Vice Chairman David Murathe has lifted the lid on the dealings that saw many aspiring politicians lose out at the 2017 party nominations. The politician sensationally claimed there was a team that was hellbent on imposing their preferred candidates on the electorate. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Thursday morning. How Chebukati plans to conduct 2022 elections The Wafula Chebukati-led IEBC has made a raft of proposals to seal endemic loopholes in an elaborate strategy to secure the 2022 presidential polls. Plagued by systemic failures in election management over the years, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has come up with an action plan that is seen as key to redeeming its ragged image. In the commission’s 2017 post-election evaluation report obtained exclusively by the Star, the IEBC proposes that to ensure proper poll preparations, commissioners must be in office at least two years to elections. _____________________________________________________ NASA lied about server access - IEBC The IEBC has reignited the election servers controversy, saying the National Super Alliance lied to Kenyans that its experts were denied access.

This was after making 54 attempts, 20 of them unsuccessful. _____________________________________________________ Brother found guilty of framing sister as a terrorist to take over property They say blood is thicker than water, but in recent times, water has become thicker than blood.

James Mwenda, for instance, has been smiling all the way to the bank after ditching bananas to farm eggplants, commonly known as biringanya. “I have been planting eggplants for five years, and compared to bananas, they fetch better prices.
