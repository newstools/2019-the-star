Garissa University has re-submitted eight courses for certification to the Commission of University Education. Deputy Vice-Chancellor Hussein Golicha said the courses were inherited from Moi University to which they were a constituent college. They had been approved by Moi University Senate. Golicha said there had been a misunderstanding that since the courses were approved by the senate, the institution would continue offering them. He said that contrary to media reports, the courses resubmitted were eight and not 10. The courses are Bachelor of Arts (Geography) with four students, Bachelor of Arts (Political Science and Public Administration) with 14 students and Bachelor of Arts (Community Development) with 39 students. The others are Bachelor of Science (Applied Statistics and Computing) with nine students and Bachelor of Science (Actuarial Science) with 50 students. Golicha said the majority of the particular courses now have up to 60 government-sponsored students. He urged students to remain calm as the matter was addressed with CUE. According to a local daily, CUE rejected 133 courses with a cumulative enrolment capacity of 10,000 slots. CUE is supposed to approve all the academic programmes taught in local universities. It will only approve programmes that are supported by adequate resources, including infrastructure, academic staff and library resources. “An approved academic programme that does not attract adequate students for a period of four years should be deemed to be obsolete and discontinued,” the regulations read. “Of concern is that there are students already studying these programmes who might now be forced to discontinue their studies due to mistakes that are not of their own making,” the article reads. Garissa University is alleged to have 10 rejected courses.
