A 22-year-old man arrested while smuggling a baby out of KNH over Sh56,000Â bill has been freed on a three-month suspended sentence. That means Boniface Murage is free but should not commit any offence in the three months or he will serve the sentence. His lawyer Charles Madowo said the bill has been cleared and Murage is very remorseful. The lawyer said the only offence he committed is being poor. Murage appeared before senior principal magistrate Caroline Muthoni Nzibe. "The matter has caused a lot of public interest on social media. However, the scales of justice must balance. In this case, the hospital has already been paid and so the scales tilt to the accused person," the magistrate said. Madowo said Murage is the sole breadwinner and a loving dad whose intention was not to commit a criminal offence but to take his child home. The prosecution said the child was admitted to KNH on January 26 and discharged on February 11 after accumulating a bill of Sh56,936. Click here for the latest political news
