Fafi MP Abdikarim Osman yesterday defended himself against accusations he was involved in the fake sex tape linked to Wajir Woman Representative Fatuma Gedi. Gedi had dismissed the video as fake. It emerged in December. She accused her political rivals of seeking to malign her. There were media reports that the DCI had summoned Osman for questioning alongside Aden Keynan (Eldas), Purity Ngurichi (Kirinyaga) and Gathoni Wamuchoma (Kiambu). He said it was a “surprising and laughable bit of news”. “I categorically state that I’ve not in any way maligned, defamed nor had the thought of doing any of that to my sister Hon Fatuma occurred to me. What interest would I even remotely have in defaming her?” he asked at a press conference in Kamuthe village, Fafi. “I’m a politician. What political interest would I have in doing so? I don’t come from Wajir county. Hon Fatuma can’t influence voters in my constituency and neither can I influence hers. Incidentally, two of the three other MPs the DCI is seeking also don’t come from Wajir.” Osman said he was in Djibouti on official duty when the tape surfaced. He said he sent the clip to Gedi after she asked for it but added that sharing the video could not make him culpable.  “Hadn’t she asked for what was then largely in the public domain? Hadn’t I only acceded to her request?” Osman said he had not received a summons from the DCI or the clerk of the National Assembly.  He said he is willing to share the communication he had with Gedi.
