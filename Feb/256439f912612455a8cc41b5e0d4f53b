Tanzanian RnB singer Juma Jux and Nyashinski have teamed up for a collabo titled, 'In case you don't know'. The song brings the message to all lovers to know the value of their partner’s presence in their life. The two artistes have been buddies for a while now. In a previous interview with Juma Jux, he hinted that he will be doing more collabos with Kenyan artistes. Nyashinski, on the other hand, is known for mellow love songs and this is no different from what he has done before. His love hits include: 'Malaika' and 'Hello'. He wrote on his Instagram: "Something smooth for you to lounge and cut up to." Otile Brown wrote: "This has to be my favorite of ya tunes. Bless you."
