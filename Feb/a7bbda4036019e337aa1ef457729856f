Trade Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya will on Friday oversee the destruction of seized illicit goods valued at more than Sh10 million at the Bamburi Cement plant. The CS is also expected to give an update on the progress in the war against illicit trade in relation to the attainment of President Uhuru Kenyatta's Big Four agenda. In August last year, Uhuru witnessed the destruction of Sh1.5 billion of illicit goods in Machakos where he warned leaders not to politicise the fight against corruption, impunity and economic crimes. The illicit goods were destroyed at the East African Portland Cement Grounds in Athi River. Some 149 motor vehicles, fake electronics, drugs, alcoholic drinks and sex toys were set ablaze in the destruction. Since the Anti-Counterfeit Agency was formed in March 2018, the organisation has destroyed contraband goods worth more Sh7.4 billion.
