A new institute expected to transform Kenya’s economy through science, technology and innovation is to be built at Konza Technopolis. The Kenya Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (Kenya-KAIST) is modelled on the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (Korea-KAIST). KAIST is expected to be completed by 2021, with the first batch of 200 of 600 graduate students starting classes in 2022. The national government has partnered with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Samoo Architects and Engineering Company Limited and Sunjin Engineering and Architecture Company Limited to undertake the architectural and curriculum design for the university. Konza Technopolis Development Authority CEO John Tanui said on Tuesday the firms were competitively selected. University Education and Research PS Colleta Suda said the institute will produce scientists and engineers with theory and practical knowledge for the future industry in Kenya and the East African region. Suda spoke at Konza City when the institute’s architectural and curriculum design development kicked off. Makueni Deputy Governor Adelina Mwau said the county government of Kajiado, Makueni and Machakos will support the project. “We promise you our full support in actualising this university because it will first benefit our people from Kajiado, Makueni and Machakos counties,” Mwau said. By 2030, Konza City is expected to generate at least 20,000 jobs. The positions will be filled by Konza Technopolis University Campus graduates, as well as Kenyans and experts who will live in the city. Konza is a flagship project in Kenya’s Vision 2030 economic blueprint. It will be a site of innovation for the country and the wider East Africa. The city will be a metropolis with a vibrant mix of businesses, real estate, biotechnology firms and urban amenities.
