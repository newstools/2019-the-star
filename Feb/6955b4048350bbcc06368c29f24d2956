President Uhuru Kenyatta has congratulated Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari after his re-election. Buhari was re-elected for a second four-year term, final results from Saturday's general election showed. The 76-year-old defeated his main rival, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, with a margin of just under four million votes. More on this: Buhari re-elected as Nigerian President "Congratulations...your victory is a clear demonstration of the trust and confidence the people of Nigeria have in your ability to lead the country to greater heights of progress," Uhuru said. Kenya and Nigeria enjoy longstanding cordial relations and strong cooperation in many areas. "I look forward to continuing working closely with Your Excellency in consolidating these mutually beneficial areas of cooperation for the greater good of our two countries," he said. "I wish Your Excellency good health and success as you lead your great nation to higher levels of prosperity in your second term in office." Uhuru asked Buhari to accept hisÂ renewed assurance of close cooperation of Kenya and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. On Tuesday, PDP chair Uche Secondus called the count "incorrect and unacceptable". The party said counting should be stopped, alleging data from voter card readers had been manipulated. The federal government accused the PDP of trying to "scuttle the polls" and prompt a constitutional crisis. Some 130 people have been taken into custody suspected of electoral offences, reports say. The initial vote was postponed early on 16 February, five hours before polls were due to open. Voters were also choosing members of the House of Representatives and Senate.
