Part of the multibillion-shillings Dongo Kundu bypass was vandalised after an accident involving a truck carrying soil near Port of Mombasa on Wednesday. Changamwe police boss Peter Omanwa said the driver of the truck was heading to Nairobi before he lost control of the vehicle during the 6am incident. The truck hit the pillars of a tunnel along the bypass causing part of the roof to tumble down. The lone injured driver was taken to Coast General Hospital. As a result of the accident, one lane of the road was closed indefinitely. The roof had blocked the lane for vehicles heading to Nairobi. "We have to wait for cranes to come and removed the rubble," Omanwa said. Kenya National Highways Authority said the bypass is Kenya’s most expensive road, which cost Sh2.7 billion per kilometre. The Star could not immediately estimate the cost of damage. Telephone calls and text messages to Coast KeNHA Director Jared Makori went unanswered. The 11km bypass constructed by China Engineering Construction Company runs from the Second Container Terminal and joins the Mombasa-Nairobi highway at Bonje. President Uhuru Kenyatta opened the road last year to decongest the town. The was aimed at easing movement of goods from Mombasa - an international port gateway to Kenya and her neighbours.
