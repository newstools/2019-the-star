West Pokot residents and leaders on Saturday protested against 'inflammatory remarks' made recently made by Turkana county leaders. The residents said the remarks amounted to incitement which is likely to destabilise peace in among the neighbouring communities of Pokot and Turkana. The demonstrators said that the remarks made Turkana South MP James Lomenen, Turkana Senator Malachiy Ekal Emana and woman representative Joyce Emanikor have led to a wave of insecurity along the border of the two counties. On Thursday, Lokedurus Losieruku, 28, was shot at Lami Nyeusi area. On Monday, a convoy comprising of West Pokot Governor Prof John Lonyangapuo, MPs Samuel Moroto (Kapenguria), Peter Lochakapong (Sigor) and Mark Lomunokol (Kacheliba) and the county's security team was attacked by people suspected to be police officers attached to Kainuk Administration Police station. The incident led to increased tension in the area. The Pokot demonstrators marched in Kapenguria town carrying placards and twigs demanding the arrest of the Turkana leaders. They issued a one-week ultimatum to Turkana leaders and security officers to return their stolen animals. They also vowed to block the Kitale-Lodwar highway if the Turkana leaders continued insulting their leaders. Led by Nominated MCA Elijah Kaseuseu and Kapenguria ward representative Emanuel Maddy Polokou, the residents faulted Interior CS Fred Matiang’I and IG Joseph Boinent for not taking action and arresting the leaders. They called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to sack the IG for not doing enough to beef up security in the area. Click here for the latest political news
