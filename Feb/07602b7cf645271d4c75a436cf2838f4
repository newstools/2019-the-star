Kenyan international striker Masud Juma says he is ready to bang in goals for his new side, Al Nasr SC, after joining the Libyan outfit on an 18-month deal. The former Kariobangi Sharks man, who has been a free agent for two months, said: “I am happy to have signed for one of the top sides in Libya and my aim is to help them defend the league title.” The North African side is Masoud’s third club since joining the professional ranks in 2017 and he is optimistic of learning more and improving his career. Masoud arrived in Libya on Saturday to officially seal the deal, following successful talks between representatives from both sides. He parted ways with United Arabs Emirates side Dibba Al Fujairah earlier this year and has been a free agent since then. Masud, who helped Harambee Stars win the 2017 Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup, was part of the 25-man squad called up to camp by Stars’ head coach Sebastein Migne last week for a training session ahead of the Afcon and Chan qualifiers. The 2017 Kenyan Premier League top scorer, with 17 goals for Sharks, joined South African top flight side Capetown City in 2018, but managed only one goal in four games before terminating his contract with the Msanzi side in September 2018. He trained with domestic cup champions Sharks briefly before join Al Fujairah on September 23 last year, scoring four goals in 10 appearances.
