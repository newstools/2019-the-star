Less than Sh200 million out of the Sh539 million released by the government has been paid to landowners for the construction of the Eldoret southern bypass. KeNHA north rift regional director Franklin Kipyator said Sh139 million has been paid to some of the landowners in the area where the 35km road will pass. The National Land Commission is yet to release  Sh400 million to compensate 200 beneficiaries. Kipyator presented his report to the national government projects steering committee at the county commissioner’s office on Thursday. He said KeNHA has already held consultative meetings with the landowners to assure them that they will be fully compensated. The project, jointly funded by Kenya and the African Development Bank, has been characterised by controversy with families whose land will be affected protesting against delayed compensation. The landowners have threatened to block contractors from starting the project.
