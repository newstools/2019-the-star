Here are the other stories making headlines in the Star this Monday morning. Second term Governors start planning for life after 2022 Twenty-two governors whose terms constitutionally end in 2022 have begun planning their post-term survival schemes. The second term incumbents, who are used to the trappings of power and elaborate protocols, are exploring options to continue calling the shots even after exiting office. Used to controlling billions of shillings as chiefs of the devolved units, a handful of governors are planning to contest the presidency, a few are planning to retire while many others hope to get plum appointments in the national government. _____________________________________________________ Miguna sues KAA and Emirates for torture and detention Controversial city lawyer Miguna Miguna has sued the Kenya Airports Authority and International airline Emirates for illegal torture and detainment. In a ten-page affidavit to the High Court, the vocal lawyer wants the courts to compel the two entities punished for damages and unlawful detention. Through his lawyers John Khaminwa said the two, KAA and Emirates should be further punished for unlawful search, seizure, sedation, torture and assault. _____________________________________________________ Sh2 billion graft suspect awarded state job A key suspect in the alleged looting of Sh2 billion from the Migori County coffers is among tens of individuals awarded with plum State appointments.
