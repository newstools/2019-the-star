EACC has dismissed claims that some of its staff were part of a bank robbery in Nandi. In a press statement, the commission said the reports are malicious and false aimed at tainting the image of the commission. The statement signed by CEO Twalib Mbarak said the allegation that Sh449,000 was stolen by one Dominic Borchigei, an EACC official, inside the banking hall in Kapsabet is untrue. Mbarak said an anonymous report was made to its North Rift regional office in Eldoret that officials coordinating the IDP's compensation in Nandi county were collecting between Sh5,000 and Sh9,000 to facilitate payment by the government. The IDP's were being paid Sh50,000 each through Equity Bank-Kapsabet Branch. "In November 2018, a team of EACC officers received information that IDPs were giving out Sh9,000 to the officials inside the bank. The team also established that said officials had been allocated a desk inside the bank where they were collecting the money upon payment," Mbarak said in the statement. He said the team found out that coordinator Maina Muriuki, secretary Samwel Nyangeri and assistant secretary Dominic Borchigei were behind the conspiracy. "On 14/11/2018, EACC sleuths conducted a sting operation at the bank and arrested Dominic Borchigei before he was escorted to the bank's manager's office. He was searched and Sh99,050 was recovered and recorded," he said. Mbarak said the entire process was video recorded and clips will constitute part of the evidence to be used in court. He said after the incident, the driver was escorted to Kapsabet police station where he was booked for further processing. "The commission is conducting further investigations into the matter and the suspects will be taken to court. Click here for the latest political news.
