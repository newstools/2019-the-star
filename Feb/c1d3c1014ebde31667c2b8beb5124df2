Captain Joseph Kinuthia, the longest-serving Kenya Airways pilot, has retired after 42 years of service to the airline. Kinuthia is best remembered for being in charge of the maiden Kenya Airways flight to New York last year. He touched down at JKIA for his final flight, KQ003, at 8:54am on February 19, a day to his birthday. He was accompanied on arrival from the US by the same crew members that were aboard the inaugural flight to New York on October 28, 2018. Kenya Airways described Kinuthia as a diligent worker who served with the utmost professionalism. “Today we bid farewell to a long-serving and loyal employee Cpt Joseph Kinuthia. Thank you for the 42 years of unwavering service, commitment, resilience and sacrifice that you gave to the KQ family,” Kenya Airways tweeted on Tuesday. The 65-year-old pilot was moved to tears after his family, fellow pilots and Kenya Airways staff congratulated him on a job well done. “The thing I appreciate most about this company is that it has given me the opportunity to do what I love for the last 42 years. I also thank Kenya Airways for being a good employer, who gave me an opportunity to grow in the industry and train many pilots. We have had a good work relationship," Kinuthia said. Despite his exceptional performance record,  Kinuthia said he has many plans, among them, training young pilots. Read:Kenya Airways' maiden flight lands in New York after 31-minute delay
