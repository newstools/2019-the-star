Champions Nairobi Queens coach Jack Ochieng thinks life in the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) League is boring due to lack of competitition from rivals. Queens, who remain unbeaten with 28 points from 14 matches, take on Kenyatta University tomorrow in one of the five matches on the card at Kaloleni grounds. Ochieng, a national women’s team coach said the fact that the team has won the titles back-to-back since 2013 leaves a lot to be desired. “How can a team win the titles for more than five years unbeaten? I have seen teams that have the potential to do well or better still can give us proper competition but the calibre of coaching in the country is wanting,” he noted. He added: “We have one match on Sunday (tomorrow) against KU before we finalise the league with a match against National Cereals and Produce Board next month.  As much as they are worthy opponents, we are confident of winning both matches and retaining the title.” Ochieng said they are seeking to participate in this year’s Club Championship, where he hope they will get the much needed competition. “As per now, we don’t have a sponsor but we hope we will still participate in the event as this is where my players who form a big chunk of national team players pick their experience and exposure,” he said.
