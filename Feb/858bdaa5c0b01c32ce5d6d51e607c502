Siaya leaders have been told to stop early campaigns for the 2022 general elections and initiate development. Future Life Tabernacle Church bishop Isaac Obure said leaders should tone down on politics. He spoke to journalists in his office on Friday. “It is not fair to always have politics of confrontation in Siaya from one political period to another without giving room for development,” primate said, adding that after the Handshake the political atmosphere had changed and everyone should pay attention to development.
