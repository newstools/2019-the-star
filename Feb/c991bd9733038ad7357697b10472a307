Coast regional coordinator John Elungata on Friday announced an anti-narcotics crackdown. “I’m sending a strong signal to drug barons, traffickers and peddlers that it would not be business as usual under my watch,” he said. Elungata spoke during his first security and intelligence meeting at Uhuru na Kazi building. He is taking over from Bernard Leparmarai after a reshuffle by Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet. Elungata said he will fight counterfeit and contraband goods and organised crime. “The influx of counterfeit goods and illicit trade is growing at a surprising rate. It is posing danger to the economy,” he said. Youth are suffering at the expense of a few rich individuals. He said it has led to crime. Elungata said criminals will not be spared. “I urge religious and community leaders to confront these problems because their impact on society is huge and cannot be wished away,” he said. Mombasa has more than 30 juvenile criminal gangs. Some are Wakali Wao and Wakali Kwanza that operate in Kisauni. This has damaged the confidence levels of investors and tourists. Elungata said neighbourhood watch committees will help police combat crime. He also said terrorism be fought collaboratively.
