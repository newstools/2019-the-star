President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday ordered Cabinet ministers to support Interior CS Fred Matiang'i, or resign. Some ministers are disgruntled over Matiangi's appointment two weeks ago as chairperson of the new Cabinet sub-committee known as the National Development Implementation and Communication Cabinet Committee. It includes all CSs, Attorney General Kihara Kariuki and Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua. Some observers believe that Matiang'i is now effectively the number two in government and that Deputy President William Ruto has been marginalised. Under the present Constitution, Cabinet secretaries are supposed to be technocrats rather than politicians. They are not elected MPs. They are supposed to focus on service delivery, not political campaigning. Thursday's Cabinet meeting only managed to cover two agenda items because the Matiang'i issue soaked up so much time. There is still three years and seven months to go before the next election. This is not the time to get sucked into petty politics at the expense of national development. Those CSs who feel jealous of Matiang'i ( believed to be five in number) should put their rivalry aside, concentrate on doing their jobs and support the President's agenda. We need economic and social progress, not political infighting.  Quote of the day: "Sometimes people mistake the way I talk for what I am thinking."
