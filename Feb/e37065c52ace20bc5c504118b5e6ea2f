JamboPay does not want to renew its automated revenue collection contract with City Hall which ends in April. Web Tribe chief executive officer Danson Muchemi said in a letter dated January 7, that they will not reapply for the contract. JamboPay is owned by Web Tribe. “We make reference to the contract between ourselves and the City County of Nairobi for the supply, implementation and maintenance of an automated revenue collection and payments solution. Our attention has been drawn to clause eight specifying the duration, and note that the contract is due for expiry on April 7, 2019,” Muchemi said. On Friday, the county government advertised in one of the local dailies for the service, calling all interested bidders to apply. JamboPay officials cited the reasons for their not reapplying as political interference and intimidation. They say some county officials and MCAs have been calling for the termination of the contract while others have been on their defence. WebTribe has had the contract for the last five years. Yesterday, the firm’s chief finance officer Dominic Kosgei said: “For us we knew the contract was coming to an end and the county was not proactive in terms of engaging us.”
