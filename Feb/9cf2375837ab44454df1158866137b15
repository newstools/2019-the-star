Knut has urged the government to implement the UN Enforcement Act to curb the assault of teachers. Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion on Friday decried the rising cases of assault of teachers. "The act will ensure that children, teachers and workers are safe in such an environment," he told KTN news on Friday. The declaration describes the immediate and long-term consequences of attacks on education and military use of schools and universities for students, teachers, and communities living in situations of armed conflict. It contrasts this with the positive and protective role that education can play during armed conflict. It highlights the importance of key mechanisms, instruments, and initiatives that contribute to protecting education from attack, in particular, relevant Security Council resolutions and the UN Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism on grave violations against children. Sossion's utterances come after a teacher in Nakuru West was allegedly attacked to death by two students for confiscating their mobile phone. The teacher was supervising evening studies and was attacked as he walked to his house.

Lack of proper ways of punishing students in school after the government abolished corporal punishment is also to blame," Sossion said. Sossion also accused the Teachers Service Commission of ignoring their grievances. In 2018, six teachers from Chalbi Boys High School in North-Horr were injured after they were attacked by students for being 'outsiders'. The students descended on the teachers and threw stones at them. Chief Guyo Isako said the teachers tried to escape but the students caught up with them and attacked them.
