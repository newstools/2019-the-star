Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has offered Sh300,000 reward for information on missing human rights activist Caroline Mwatha. Sonko on Monday urged anybody with information to contact the nearest police station or the Directorate of Criminal Investigations offices. Mwatha, a senior official at Dandora Community Social Justice Center, disappeared last Wednesday. She had been documenting cases of enforced disappearance and police extrajudicial killings, including the cold blood murder of six Dandora residents in October last year. Her search has been extended to water bodies and forests in Nairobi and its vicinity. Coordinator Wilfred Olal said they have written to relevant bodies to grant them access to forests and rivers.
