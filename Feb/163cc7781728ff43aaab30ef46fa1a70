With his side struggling to keep their heads above water, Posta Rangers coach John Kamau has pinpointed the fitness levels of his players as the biggest concern as his team tries to find their way out of the dreaded relegation zone they currently occupy. “I am confident that once the fitness of the players improve, so will the results. We have been starting matches well then fading towards the end and that is something we will work on for sure,” remarked the national under-20 coach after the mailmen ended their five-match losing streak with a goal-less draw. “There were a lot of positives to take from the match which we would have won had we taken our chances,” added Kamau. Posta have been tipped to be title contenders ever since they returned to the premier league but they have fallen way short of most pundits predictions and the resilient so far indicates more disappointments ahead. With a paltry seven points from 11 matches, Kamau must be inwardly pleased that only three points separate them and the safety position now occupied surprisingly by twelve time league winners. To negotiate away from the lower wrung of the top tier, the former Thika United tactician will have to coax the best form out of midfielder Brian Osumba and left back Wesley Onguso—two title winning players signed from Tusker and Gor Mahia respectively to try and re-awaken the winning mentality in the aging squad.
