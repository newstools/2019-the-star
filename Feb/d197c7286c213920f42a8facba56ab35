Muhoroni MP Onyango Koyoo has raised concern over cartels in the sugar sector of funding farmers to form a parallel task force. “We only have one taskforce appointed by Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri. These cartels should allow the task force to do its work,” Koyoo said. The task force shall review the policy of the industry, check on emerging challenges, do research and review the importation of sugar. Kiunjuri co-chairs the team with Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. Governors Okoth Obado (Migori) and Anyang’ Nyong’o (Kisumu) are members. Koyoo cautioned farmers against being used by a few millers who are “only out to plunder the sector dry”. He said all stakeholders will be given room to look at the sugar report once tabled and make possible amendments. The task force is also expected to review sugar pricing and funding mechanism. It will also undertake an analysis of the roles of stakeholders and how they can collaborate to develop the sugar sub-sector.
