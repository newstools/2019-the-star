Bomet patients can now breathe a sigh of relief after nurses in the county called off their strike. The nurses on Wednesday agreed to go back to work after consultations with the Kenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN) officials. Bomet is among the counties that joined the strike on Monday this week. The county's head of Public Service Evalyne Rono after signing the return-to-work formula said there will be no victimisation of striking nurses as a sign of goodwill. The county official said the local issues raised during the talks will be resolved within 21 days.

She said the county appreciates the hard work and dedication of nurses and would do everything possible to address their grievances. Bomet joins Murang'a, Kisii and Embu counties whose nurses called off their strike this week.
