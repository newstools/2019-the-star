Yesterday Morpho directors failed to come before the Public Accounts Committee, which is examining its deal to provide 45,000 KIEMS kits for the 2017 elections. Morpho, under its new name Idemia, is tendering for the Sh3 billion digital registration system for the new national population register. MPs are now threatening to block Morpho/Idemia's bid for that system. In 2017 the opposition accused Morpho of collaborating with Jubilee to massage election results on its servers in France. Subsequently, Morpho allegedly ignored a court order and blocked Nasa from backend access to its servers. Morpho has always protested its innocence and yesterday Morpho could have cleared its name before the PAC. Dodging the PAC makes Morpho look like it has a guilty conscience and something to hide. Morpho/Idemia has only itself to blame if it gets blacklisted in Kenya. It did not send its apologies and it treated the Kenyan Parliament withÂ disrespect. It should make sure that it respects the PAC's final invitation to appear before them next Monday. Quote of the day: "A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life."
