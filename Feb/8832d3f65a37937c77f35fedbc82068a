Migori residents on Friday protested the rising insecurity after two traders were murdered in separate incidents. Joshua Obura, 42, was killed on Wednesday in Rongo at dawn and another trader Patrick Gake was killed on Monday night at Ikerege in Kuria West. “No one had been arrested over the deaths. This trend is worrying. We are fearing for our security,”National Chamber of Commerce Industry chairman Samuel Rumo said. Speaking during a press conference on Friday, Rumo said the traders who fear for their lives should report to the police. Rumo said the increasing number of illegal guns in Migori is the cause of rising crime in the area. Obura was hacked to death at Siala village as he left his house for a business trip at 4am. Rongo police boss Peter Kirui said the trader was heading to Kisii town to buy stock for his business. “We have launched investigations to know the motive for the murder. He was attacked on his doorstep and nothing was stolen from the house,” Kirui said. The body was taken to Rosewood Hospital mortuary for an autopsy. Police are also investigating Gake's murder in Kuria West. The trader was shot dead by three armed gangsters as he was entering his compound after closing his business. Migori police boss Joseph Nthenge said the incident happened at around 8pm. Witness Joseph Chacha said the businessman was shot twice on the head and the chest near his gate. "We heard several gunshots at around 8pm. Because of our safety, it took us some minutes to reach the scene. We found his body was in a pool of blood,” Chacha said. The body was taken to Pastor Machage Memorial mortuary in Migori town. Residents said such brutal murders are shocking. They want the police to arrest the suspects.
