A man who allegedly murdered his wife after accusing her of having an extramarital affair has also been killed by mob in Kwale county. Mwania Hassan, 40, is reported to have stabbed his wife Riziki Hamisi, 22, to death on Monday night following a quarrel. The two had just arrived back home from a burial ceremony in Kinango. "When they got home, the wife disappeared and was later caught red-handed with another man who managed to escape," a neighbour said. Another neighbour Hasia Mwachikunya said residents heard a commotion in the couple’s home on Monday night and when they went to confirm they discovered the murder. “He claimed they had been attacked by armed robbers but the villagers became suspicious of him and decided to search the compound where they found his wife’s naked body lying in a pool of blood and covered with grass,” said Mwachikunya. She said the enraged villagers lynched the man for killing his wife, a mother of a two-year-old child. Matuga Police Chief Mr. Joel Chesire confirmed the two deaths adding that police have commenced investigations. “The woman was fatally stabbed by her husband who reportedly found her in the arms of another man,” he said adding that the two bodies were taken to Kwale Hospital mortuary. Last week, a 70-year-old woman was murdered by unknown people at Mazola village, Kinango Sub County on suspicions of being a witch. Click here for the latest political news
