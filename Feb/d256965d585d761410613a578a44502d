The officers arrived at his Karen home on Wednesday morning and have been going through documents. Another team is at the homes and offices of chief officers, directors and contractors. The officers say there has been a misappropriation of funds meant for the county hence the searches. They have search warrants. A 14-seater PSV Serian Sacco (route 125/126) under the registration KBD 046P, was allegedly carrying anti-corruption detectives to Samburu Governor Moses Kasaine's Karen mansionettes in the name of hiding their identity.
