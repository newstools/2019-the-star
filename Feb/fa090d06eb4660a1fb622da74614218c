The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has dismissed as fake, a letter circulating on social media linking Mombasa governor Hassan Joho to trade in narcotics. Responding to Joho's lawyers who had inquired by the authenticity of the letter which bore Interpol letterhead, the directorate advised Joho to pursue civil remedy over the injuries that the claims may have caused him. The impugned letter bearing the Interpol logo had listed Joho alongside other people as being investigated by the international policing agency over handling of illicit drugs. But the DCI said it may not make head ways in investigating the origin of the forged letter. "Since we may not go far in investigating the origin of the forged letter in the social media, please take civil remedies for those spreading the malicious rumours," the letter signed by John Kariuki for the DCI said. The DCI letter was written on February 13 and copied to the director of public prosecution Noordin Haji. The confirmation by the DCI that the claims about the Mombasa governor as a forgery is an interesting development given that he had sued his Nandi counterpart Joshua Sang', MPs Oscar Sudi, Kimani Ichung'wah and Didimus Baraza for linking him to the narcotics trade. Despite the suit, the four had remained defiant, asking Joho to respond to their claims.

The case was certified as urgent and the four given 15 days to respond. Click here for the latest political news
