Good Morning. As patients continue to suffer in Kenyan hospitals, striking nurses have remained unshaken by President Uhuru Kenyatta's order to resume work by Friday. The nurses, through their union, have maintained the strike is still on, with more counties expected to join in from Monday next week. Here are the other stories making headlines in the Star this Thursday morning. Uhuru nightmare over Sh300bn stalled projects President Uhuru Kenyatta is facing a nightmare as he looks for money to complete Sh393 billion projects stalled across the country. Fresh details emerged yesterday as Uhuru struggles to deliver his legacy projects under the Big Four agenda in three years and seven six months before leaving State House in 2022. The Big Four — healthcare, food security, manufacturing, and housing — are to be his legacy, as well as crushing corruption. _____________________________________________________ Desperate Kalonzo now showers praise on Uhuru Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has again triggered a hilarious political storm after claiming President Uhuru Kenyatta should curve out an Executive after his term ends in 2022. The remarks sparked off a flurry of reactions, with his critics gleefully saying the Wiper leader had given up his presidential ambitions. In a Tuesday News Night interview on Citizen TV, Kalonzo said Uhuru is the best President Kenya has ever had, delivering a damning verdict for the country’s three past heads of state – including Mwai Kibaki who gave him a job as Vice President between 2007-13. _____________________________________________________ Detainees from Moi regime awarded Sh46m Three senior citizens illegally detained by the Moi regime in connection with the 1982 Coup have been awarded Sh46 million in damages.

This month alone, 10 newborns have died at the facility. _____________________________________________________ Nairobi top contributor to Kenya's wealth, Isiolo trails - KNBS The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics has debunked claims by sections of Central Kenya leaders that the region contributes 60 per cent to the country’s gross domestic product. Meeting under the banner of Mount Kenya Parliamentary Caucus in October last year they cited a study that ranked Kiambu County as the richest county in Kenya with a GDP per capita of $1,785 (Sh178,500).
