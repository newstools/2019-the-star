The Public health department has disposed of 19 unclaimed bodies at Isiolo Referral Hospital’s Mortuary to ease congestion and reduce the cost of operations at the facility. The public health officer in charge of the Hospital George Gitonga said three of them were preserved for more than six months and the others for over two months. He said the facility which was recently renovated and installed with new cooling machines has a capacity of 16 bodies. The facility had 25 bodies against its capacity. Gitonga said keeping bodies for that long had significantly increased the cost of operations due to the usage of electricity and preservation chemicals. The Public Health Act Cap 242 allows hospital management to dispose of unclaimed bodies after 14 days with court consent. Gitonga said most of the bodies were brought to the morgue by police. “Some communities prefer not to claim the bodies of their kinsmen killed while stealing animals for fear they could be subjected to interrogation by police,” he added.
