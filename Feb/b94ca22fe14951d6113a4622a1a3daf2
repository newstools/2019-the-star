The husband of late Kiambu Woman Mary Wambui wiped his flowing tears at the court as hearing of the murder case commenced on Wednesday. Joseph Kori 41, who wore a black jacket was seen trying to control his tears at the Kiambu court as the hearing of the case went on. When he was brought before the court, Kori was doing fine until his lawyer started presenting his case before Kiambu senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo. He took out his white handkerchief and begun wiping his tears that were freely flowing down his cheeks at the court. Kori is among the three suspects in the murder of Wambui. His mistress Judy Wangui and a car hire businessman Michael Mathenge who admitted to having helped ferry Wambui’s body to a dam in Juja was also present in court. Police are seeking 14 more days to continue detaining the three suspects over the murder. The prosecution told Kiambu senior principal magistrate that investigators need more time to complete investigations which is a complex matter. But defence lawyers opposed the application, saying nothing is being done by police. Wambui disappeared on January 26, and her body was found the following day at Courtesy Beach in Juja. In the video that surfaced days after her brutal murder, Wambui, 39, tells people challenges never last forever.
