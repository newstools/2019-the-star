Kenya Cup leaders Kabras have made two changes for tomorrow’s blockbuster against KCB at the Impala Club. Loose-head prop Ephraim Oduor and lock Brian Juma have come in for Hosea Ngesa and Charlton Mokua ahead of what will be the biggest match of the season so far. Keegan Kevin and Felix Ayange are on the wings, Kenya Cup top-scorer Philip Wokorach (fullback), Logan Basson (fly-half) while Nick Baraza is the centre . Kabras coach Henley Du Plessis said the game is the biggest test for them this season. “It will be an intense physical game. We must be at our best and take the game to the KCB,” added Du Plessis. Kabras lead the log on 49 points and are still unbeaten five points ahead of the KCB. Du Plessis said they have worked on the defence and the line-out this week. “It’s been a busy week. We have worked hard on out defence andline-out because we know KCB will test us a lot,” he added. Du Plessis said the changes for the match were meant to give the fresh players a chance to play the game on Saturday. “Hosea and Mokua have played a lot of minutes and we now want to give them break. We have depth in their positions and let us see how Juma and Oduor will fare,” he noted Kabras have a poor record against KCB losing (27-3) in 2015, 34-8 (2017) and 29-24 (2018) in Kenya cup finals. Elsewhere, the match between Quins and Strathmore Leos slated for tomorrow has been pushed to Sunday. The two clubs have commitments on Saturday. The Eric Shirley Shield matches pitting the two sides will be played at 2pm with the Kenya Cup game being played at 4pm.
