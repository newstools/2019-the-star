Police in Ndhiwa have arrested a 16-year-old schoolgirl over the death of a man at her uncle’s farm. She was picked up on Sunday night in a house at Rantang’a market, where she was hiding after allegedly stabbing to death Denis Manyuro, 21, with a kitchen knife. The incident happened in Kwabwai ward on Saturday. The suspect is a Form 3 student at a school in Ndhiwa. Manyuro, who was a labourer at a farm owned by the girl’s uncle, is said to have been close to her. The two are said to have quarrelled. “The man was stabbed in the chest. He collapsed and died on the spot,” chief Patrick Lumumba said yesterday. The Central Kwabwai chief said the girl had returned home for the midterm break. She arrived on Friday evening. Manyuro’s body was found in a pool of blood by the police. Lumumba said the suspect fled but she was later arrested. Homa Bay police commander Esther Seroney said they are investigating the incident. “The knife was subjected to forensic analysis and we established it was used in the murder,” she said. Seroney said they are winding up investigations before the suspect is prosecuted. Manyuro’s body was taken to Homa Bay County Referral Hospital mortuary. Click here for the latest political stories.
