Trade Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya has said he is yet to make up his mind which seat he will run for in case he returns to politics in 2022. “It is not a must I run but I have not said I won’t run. It’s just that I have not made up my mind if I will stand and for which seat,” Munya (pictured, centre) said. He said when the time comes, he will seek President Uhuru Kenyatta’s advice on where he should run. “President Kenyatta is my coach. He will arrange the team that will compete but for now let us focus on development and building bridges,” Munya said. He said after he lost to Meru governor Kiraitu Murungi, he is giving him ample time to work for the people. “Furthermore, I emulated President Uhuru who made handshake with opposition leader Raila Odinga under the Building Bridges Initiative. I made hand shake with my rival Kiraitu Murungi,” Munya said. He spoke at Maua stadium, Igembe South constituency on Saturday where he attended a requiem mass. He said Central Kenya is not divided about support for President Uhuru Kenyatta’s government. “Those who are saying Central Kenya is divided have their own agendas. We are supporting President Uhuru Kenyatta in his big four, fight against graft and building bridges initiative,” Munya said. He said the country should not be drawn into 2022 succession plan as it’s too early but should focus on development. “When the time comes, our Mt Kenya political kingpin will tell us where we should go to.”
