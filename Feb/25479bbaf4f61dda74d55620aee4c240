MPs yesterday said that the Big Four budget was unaffordable. The parliamentary Budget Committee said government had insufficient funds to execute its plans for Universal Healthcare, affordable housing, food security and manufacturing. This yearâ€™s budget allocated Sh460 billion for the Big Four but we have seen little progress apart from UHC trials in five counties. Perhaps it is time for a more prudent approach towards flagship projects. If we jump in without analysis, we can end up with projects like the over-ambitious school laptops scheme that failed to take off. There are also alarming reports that SGR freight costs may end up being double those of road transport.
