Congolese top guitarist King Kimbangu wants to work with Kenyan artistes this year. Arrow Bwoy and Naiboi are the two artistes on his target list, says his East Africa manager Patrick Sampao. Kimbangu has been playing the solo guitar for Wenge Musica BCBG, famous for massive hits in the early 2000s like 'Ndombolo' and 'Solola Bien'. The band comprises Werrason and JB Mpiana. "My main motivation is to blend the Congolese soukous solo guitar to the East African sound to achieve a unique sonic sound that Kenyans can dance to," Kimbangu says. This feat was achieved by Ali Kiba in his 'Mwana' smash hit, as well as by Major Lazer feat Nasty C and Ice Prince in the monster hit 'Particular'.
