Farmers in Meru have been urged to insure their crops and diversify to avoid losses due to climate change. Agriculture extension officers and One Acre Fund officials met farmers at Kiamakoro MCK church in Mwanganthia ward, Imenti Central constituency during issuance of certified seeds, subsidised fertilizer and other farm inputs. Winnie Akiso from One Acre Fund told journalists 4,000 Meru farmers have enlisted with the organisation to receive the inputs before the onset of rains. “We hope to enroll more farmers. We give them solar lamps, seeds, post harvest driers and other farm inputs all at a subsidised fee. We are doing this in partnership with county governments to help fight poverty,” she said. The organisation is sensitising farmers to enroll in their crops insurance program. Farmers lauded the program but asked the county government to prioritise provision of water for irrigation. They said the area has had only two water projects on Mariara river and this is inadequate. Imenti Central agricultural officer Peter Mwangi said the county government would open an insurance office in Meru.
