The Supreme Court has upheld Lamu Governor Fahim Yassin Twaha's election. The court ruled on Wednesday that the court of appeal did not err in upholding his election. Former Governor Issah Timamy had challenged the court of appeal decision that upheld Twaha's election. The judges ruled that the Appeal Court did not go beyond its jurisdiction. Justice Mohammed Ibrahim said they found no fault on the Court of Appeal decision. The court ruled that Timamy was unable to prove any allegations of impartiality and thus hisÂ appeal was dismissed. IEBC declared Twaha (Jubilee) winner with 22,969 votes (46.57%) against Timamy's 22,848 (45.45%) during the 2017 general elections. More to follow Click here for the latest political news.
