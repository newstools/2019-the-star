The arrival of a new baby is often met with parents proudly proclaiming it has their eyes, nose or mouth. But research suggests children may even inherit how responsible they are from their mother and father. A study of more than 700 siblings suggests DNA may influence the moral compass of the young more than their upbringing. Scientists found closely-related siblings are more similar to their parents, even if their step brothers and sisters grew up in the same home. The researchers stress, however, our genes just 'give us potential' and we can still 'shape who we become'. The research was carried out by The Pennsylvania State University and led by Amanda Ramos, a PhD candidate from the department of psychology. 'A lot of studies have shown a link between parenting and these virtuous traits, but they haven't looked at the genetic component,' Ramos said. 'I thought that was a missed opportunity because parents also share their genes with their children, and what we think is parents influencing and teaching their children these characteristics may actually be due, at least in part, to genetics.' To uncover the role of genetics, the researchers analysed 720 pairs of siblings aged 12-14. These included identical and fraternal twins, brothers and sisters from both divorced and intact families, half siblings, and step brothers and sisters. By including a range of different types of siblings, who varied in how related they were, the researchers could get to the bottom of how big a role genetic and environmental factors play in influencing personality traits. For example, identical twins share the same DNA, while step-siblings are unrelated but often live together. 'If identical twins are more similar than fraternal twins, for example, it's assumed there's a genetic influence,' Ramos said. 'Including multiple degrees of relatedness can give you more power to disentangle the genetic influences from the shared environment.' Click here for the latest political news
