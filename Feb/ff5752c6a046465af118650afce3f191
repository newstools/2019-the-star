Footballer Chris Mbamba says he is ready to switch his allegiance to Harambee Stars despite turning out for Sweden’s U-17 and U-20 national teams. The attacking midfielder, who can also play as a winger, spoke to the Star yesterday from his base in Kalmar, in the European country. He currently turns up for Sweden’s second tier side, Oskarshamns AIK. He believes it would be an honour to don Kenyan colours. “I haven’t played for the Sweden National A-team and therefore I am eligible to turn out for Kenya,” he explained. Mbamba was born 26 years ago in Harare to a Zimbabwean father and a Kenyan mother. He moved to Sweden aged eight and received his football education there. “ It’s been challenging but stimulating. A dream come true but very demanding of course, which I like. Some of the successes that stick out are memories like my professional debut for IFK Gothenburg and my professional debut on English turf,” he adds. “If I were to represent Kenya I would contribute with speed, technique, my ability to push forward and create chances. Off the pitch, I am easy to get along with, social and I like to inspire those around me so I think it would be great both for me and Kenya.” Should he be called up by Stars coach Sebastian Migne, Mbamba who’s also enjoyed stints at Norway’s top flight club Hamkam and English League One club Port Vale, will be competing against the likes of Eric Johanna, Paul Were, Ayub Timbe, Ovella Ochieng and Clifton Miheso.
