Archbishops Julius Gitau, Samson Muthuri and Fredrick Wang’ombe of the AIPCA have failed to reach a consensus over church leadership. The three have been at loggerheads since January 9, 2017, when elections were held to replace former Archbishop Mathenge Kabuthu after his term ended. Archbishop Julius Gitau told journalists that he is the duly elected archbishop and won’t engage his rivals in talks again. He accused them of stalling the dialogue “for their selfish interests”, saying they couldn’t accept him as the archbishop. AIPCA Central board chairman Paul Watoro Gichu said Wang’ombe and Muthuri are seeking leadership “through the backdoor”, adding that they are after church property.
