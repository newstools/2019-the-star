An initiative to provide an alternative source of livelihood to the FGM trade has been rolled out in Bungoma county. The drive aims to empower Sabaot women who have abandoned the trade. The 50 women stopped the practice during the anti-FGM marathon in Mt Elgon last year. The initiative is sponsored by the county government, Adventure Youth Group and Miss Tourism Bungoma. Gender and Culture executive Everlyne Kakai on Wednesday praised the women and urged them to form groups to receive funding from the Bungoma County Women Empowerment Fund. She spoke during a World Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM event in Kopsiro. The day is observed worldwide on February 6. “We are glad to announce that FGM has now been tackled in this area and we are hopeful that the trend will be sustained in future,” Kakai said. “Let us shun this practice and encourage our girls to focus on education.” She was accompanied by Gender and Culture chief officer Saphia Ibrahim.
