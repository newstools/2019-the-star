Turkana residents have urged to end cattle rustling as it fuels violence and retribution and hurts tourism. Tourism CS Najib Balala on Thursday said the region is considered the cradle of mankind. It has a rich cultural heritage and Lake Turkana shores are still unxplored. “We need to develop Turkana to be a centre for tourism but this cannot be done because violence leads to poor infrastructure,” he said in Lodwar. Security and infrastructure are important for tourism to flourish. The CS said he will ask the Transport ministry to improve roads. Governor Josphat Nanok said they will work with the ministry to turn around the economy. “We want Turkana to contribute to the country’s economy,” he said, adding it has been a consumer.
