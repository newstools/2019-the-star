Hosts Manyatta United and Ndhiwa Queens of Homa Bay were on Sunday crowned the new Nyanza Chapa Dimba na Safaricom tournament champions at Kisumu's Moi stadium. Manyatta beat Springs FC of Nyamira 5-0 to bag the bragging rights in the boy's tourney. Clinton Bulimwa and Benson Ochieng grabbed a brace each after Dennis Ayot had opened the scores. Queens were 3-0 winners over home side Manyatta united in the girls’ final played earlier on at the same venue. Their goals came through Yvonne Ogada, Susan Ogindi and Asha Achieng. The boy’s final started on a high tempo with Manyatta quickest off the blocks. Dennis Ayot's cross went begging in the box in the opening minutes but there was no one to send the ball home. Spring’s defender Charles Ongari had trouble handling Ayot and was cautioned for a reckless challenge on the winger in the 6th minute. Ayot sent a warning shot with the resultant free kick that brushed off the far right post. He, however, made up for the missed chance and opened the scores for Manyatta in the 12th minute after Charles Ongori’s acrobatic clearance fell on his path. Benson Ochieng sent the home fans into a frenzy with the the second goal in the 24th minute with a simple tap in from a cross. Benson Otieno was brought down in the box by Kibona Frank in the 32nd minute but Ochieng’ thumped the resultant spot kick over the bar. Springs, overwhelmed by the scorching lake side sun, welcomed a water break in the 35th minute as the heat took a toll on them. A resurgent Springs came back stronger, with Bryson Orare testing the Manyatta custodian Nicholas Munangwe just after the breather. Clinton Bulimu helped himself to a brace in the 50th and 74th minute. Springs resorted to defending to reduce further damage but angry Manyatta made it five with Benson Ochieng scoring his second in the 88th minute. Click here for the latest political news
