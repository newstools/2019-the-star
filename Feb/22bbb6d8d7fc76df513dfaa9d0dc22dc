The Director of Public Prosecutions has reportedly withdrawn a case of misbehaviour for filming police. This week a video captured by Njeri wa Muthoni went viral. It showed five traffic police officers roughly pulling a woman out of the front seat of a matatu on Thika Road. Fellow passenger Njeri recorded the incident on her mobile phone. So the police detained her in Kasarani police station. Yesterday morning she was due to appear in court but reportedly the DPP instructed the magistrate not to proceed with the case. Ipoa has promised to investigate and punish any police wrongdoing. The traffic police remain notorious for extortion and abuse of power. There is no law that says they cannot be filmed by the public. Njeri had done nothing wrong, she was merely trying in her own way to increase police accountability in Kenya. DPP Noordin Haji has been widely praised for clamping down on corruption but inevitably he has focused primarily on the big fish. It is good to see that Noordin also can recognise the plight of the ordinary citizen and that he has come to the aid of Njeri, a fellow Kenyan trying to defeat abuse of office.
