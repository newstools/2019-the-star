A court has freed two foreigners arrested on suspicion they had links with al Shabaab. Anti-terror unit officers arrested the Ethiopian and New Zealander at Hagadera refugee camp, Dadaab, Garissa. Sulub Warfa is from New Zealand but of Somali origin, while Sakawedin Abdullahi is from Ethiopia. They were held after the unit requested for 10 more days to verify their travel documents. Warfa changed his name from Ramadhan Yusuf. This, according to an officer, raised suspicions. The prosecution said their passports were valid and they were in Kenya legally. Chief magistrate Cosmas Maundu on Friday said they had no case to answer. He released them unconditionally. Sulub said outside the court that changing one’s name is not a crime in New Zealand. He demanded an apology. “I travelled from Nairobi to Garissa then to Dadajabula. On my way back, I was stopped at a roadblock at Hagarbul. Police officers demanded my driving licence, which I produced, and then my passport, which I also produced. Click here for the latest political news
