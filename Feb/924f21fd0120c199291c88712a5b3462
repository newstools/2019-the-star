I will be on the ballot in 2022, Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has said. Speaking during an interview with Hot 96 on Monday,  Kuria said he will be on the ballot during the next general election. "I will still vie for Presidency in 2022. I will be on the ballot," he said. Kuria expressed optimism that he would win in a contest against DP William Ruto. The MP said he was confident he will trounce Ruto in the nomination, but will not mind offering him a deputy position. "If successful, I would offer Ruto a post in my government," he said. Kuria listed his other preferred deputies as ODM leader Raila Odinga and Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana.
