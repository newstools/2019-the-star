Employees in some manufacturing companies and commercial banks will receive a Sh4,000 pay rise monthly through a tax-free lunch scheme to increase their work productivity. Apptivate Africa CEO Neil Ribeiro said the local manufacturers and commercial banks have shown interest in taking up the digital lunch voucher, M-kula that can be accepted in over 200 eateries in Nairobi. Employees under this scheme will be entitled to Sh48,000 annualy in tax-free meal cash allocations wired directly to their mobile wallet. “Employers are realizing the need to provide more than a pay cheque to keep their teams motivated. Food is a basic human need, and a great way to get employees motivated and to create an emotional connection between them and the company,” Ribeiro said. The French-owned digital scheme rebranded in 2018 from Sodexo, in a bid to sign up more companies across Africa after a two-year test run. The planned expansion is aimed at serving multinational firms that have enrolled 3,000 employees to M-Kula formed in partnership with Jumia Food, and shopping voucher reward scheme, M-Tuza.
