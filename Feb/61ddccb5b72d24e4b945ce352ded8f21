Kilifi North MP Owen Baya yesterday accused the national government of failing to release the Sh12 billion Equalisation Fund.
He also accused ODM leader Raila Odinga of not pushing for the funds.
The MP said said Coast residents voted overwhelmingly for ODM with the hope of seeing change but since the handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta, Raila has forgotten them and his focus is on Kisumu.
“In the 2022 election, we will no longer be swept by political parties wave. We’re not going to be carried like potatoes,” the lawmaker said.
Baya spoke at Kararacha Primary School after handing over two modern classrooms. In some areas of Kilifi, students still take lessons in open air for lack of classrooms.
