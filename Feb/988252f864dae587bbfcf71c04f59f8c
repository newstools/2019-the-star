The Supreme Court has overturned decisions of High Court and Court of Appeal nullifying the election of Wajir Governor Mohammed Abdi Mohamud. The ruling was the outcome of a split vote with four judges ruling in the governor's favour while two dissented. Those who ruled in the favour of the governor are Smokin Wanjala, Njoki Ndung'u, Jackton Ojwang and Mohammed Ibrahim. Chief Justice David Maraga and Justice Issac Lenaola, however, dissented saying that they were of the opinion that the governor did not have prerequisite academic qualifications to vie for governor. Mohamud's 2017 election was challenged by the county's former governor Ahmed Abdulahi. The apex court gave a notice on Tuesday that its justices have concluded considering the case. The Governor went to the apex court last year in April in the last attempt to hold on to his seat. The authenticity of governor Mahamud's degree certificate has been at the centre of the litigations, with his critics saying that his certificate is forged.
