A village in Keiyo is mourning the death of 11 people who died in a road accident on Monday at a place known as HZ along the Eldoret-Eldama Ravine road. The victims, including two assistant chiefs, were less than two kilometres to their destination when the vehicle they were travelling in hit a rail guard on a steep section of the road and rolled. Almost all the victims of the crash are from Kabiemit and Metkei wards in Keiyo South constituency. “We are devastated as a county and residents of Keiyo South. The impact of the accident is just too huge to many of our families”, said Kiprono Chepkok, the Elgeyo Marakwet county executive for health. He is leading efforts by the county to help the families bury their dead. Most of those who died were young people. The two chiefs have been eulogised as leaders who always mobilised residents for community development. Residents have formed committees to help the families. Johan Cheptogoch, Nicholas Bett and lawyer Ledisha Kipseii are coordinating the professionals. A fundraising was held yesterday in Eldoret to help the families. Another one is due to be held in Nairobi. Four other people were critically injured. Witnesses said the driver of the matatu with registration number KBG 735L heading to Ravine lost control of the vehicle at a sharp corner. The road is steep and winding. The chiefs were returning home after attending a meeting in Iten. Eight of the victims died on the spot. Three others, including the two sub-chiefs died on their way to Moi Referral Hospital in Eldoret. “Among those who died are nine men and two women. The injured have broken limbs,” hospital CEO Wilson Aruasa said.
