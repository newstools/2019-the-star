Two days after President Uhuru Kenyatta toured Kisii, an MP has said lawmakers from Nyamira had planned to boycott the event. West Mugirango MP Vincent Kemosi said on Thursday they wanted to snub the function after learning that Uhuru was not going to visit their county. On Wednesday, the President, Deputy President William Ruto and Opposition chief Raila were in Kisii. The Head of State launched health projects at the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital. Kemosi said Nyamira politicians had held a meeting at a Kisii hotel and resolved not to attend the event. Among those who attended the Kisii, meeting included MPs Shadrack Mose (Kitutu Masaba), Ben Momanyi (Borabu), Jerusha Momanyi (Women Rep) and Kemosi. Senator Eric Okong'o and Governor John Nyagarama were also present. Kemosi accused his colleagues who went to Uhuru's function of betrayal. Kemosi and his Borabu counterpart Momanyi did not attend. Kemosi, a first-time MP, said the President's itinerary was changed because of "unexplainable political forces". He accused some politicians from Kisii of being aggressive and blocking them from presenting their views in the "neighbour's land." "How could we go to Kisii to tell the President what we want him to do for Nyamira people when he has all the convenience of coming to Nyamira to witness by himself what we need?" Kemosi asked. The MP blamed Uhuru for not honouring pledges he made to residents which include the construction of Bondeni-Makairo-Magombo road and a school bus he promised to Nyachogochogo Secondary School in his constituency in 2017.
