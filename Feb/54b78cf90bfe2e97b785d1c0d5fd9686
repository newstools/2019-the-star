TV presenter Betty Kyallo's sister Mercy Kyallo says dealing with their brother's alcohol addiction was a most trying experience. “One of the lowest moments in our lives and the most humbling was when our brother was battling with alcoholism," Mercy told Word Is on Sunday. "We had to take him to rehab.” The brother is finally alcohol-free, but the whole situation means a lot to her. “We never talk about that and we never really talk about mental health. And that is something that is close to my heart. He is now perfect and back to himself,” she said. Adding, “Just that process of taking a loved one to rehab, and dealing with drug addiction, it just really humbled me and is an experience I will never forget. And I will never judge anybody going through such a situation.” As part of her things to do this year, Mercy says she will be highlighting the issues to do with mental health to inspire more people. “I respect anybody working with anything to do with the mental health. As a society, we never talk about mental health," she said. "Everyone talks about physical abuse or emotional abuse, but no one talks about mental health or even accepts that it is a growing problem in Kenya. It is a disease just like any other.” Mercy Kyallo is the founder of Yallo Leather Company, an online company. She was introduced to many on social media by her celebrity sister, Betty Kyallo. “I did not want to be a celebrity. I did not sign up to be famous. Not many people become famous because of their siblings. And that happened to me. So, I have just been authentic. I don’t pretend to be anything. That is why when I feel like dressing official, I do so, I just do me,” Mercy said.
