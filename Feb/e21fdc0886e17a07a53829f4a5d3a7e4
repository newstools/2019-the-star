Investors remain reluctant in setting up firms in counties without market, raw materials and support infrastructure, according to the Kenya Association of Manufacturers. It said only 22 counties, translating to 46.8 per cent, have established manufacturing activities. They are Nairobi, Mombasa, Kiambu, Machakos, Kajiado, Muranga, Nyeri, Meru, Laikipia, Nakuru and Baringo. Others are Narok, Uasin Gishu, Nandi, Kericho, Trans Nzoia, Kisumu, Kisii, Kakamega, Kilifi, Lamu and Isiolo. Makueni and Kitui are also making gains in attracting manufacturers. KAM said lack of manufacturers in some regions places them at the risk of not prospering. It said there is a natural tendency of clustering of manufacturing activities in areas close to the market, raw materials and support infrastructure such as railways, roads, airports, water services. “If these are missing, manufacturers shy away from setting up firms,” KAM said in a statement. Majority of manufacturing activities and enterprises are attracted by the existence of Export Processing Zones and industrial parks. Some of the zones in the country include Kenanie Leather Park in Athi River and Sameer Industrial Park in Nairobi. KenGen is expected to construct an industrial park at the Olkaria power plant in Naivasha this year, in partnership with Export Promotion Zone, supplying power to businesses at low tariffs. Real estate private equity firm Actis and South Africa’s Improvon Group plan to construct a Sh11 billion industrial park off the Eastern bypass.
