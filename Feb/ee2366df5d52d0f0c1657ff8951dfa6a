Six cars have been stolen at night while parked in the homes of their owners, Etyang told the Star. “For about three months, there has been rampant theft of cars in this area. Some people have reported having parked their cars outside their houses but after waking up in the morning they found them missing,” he said. Police have identified some suspects they are pursuing. Etyang called on members of public who could have reliable information to share it with the police. The reports will be treated with confidence. The DCI boss said owners of Probox cars are unhappy after the government banned them from public transport. He said most owners acquired the cars on loan they are unable to repay. Police suspect the thefts could be a collusion between owners and the thieves to avoid repaying the loans and pass the burden to insurers. The National Transport and Safety Authority banned Toyota Probox and Toyota Wish type of vehicles from public transport because they are not licensed to do so. NTSA deputy director for licensing John Muya said the vehicles were carrying passengers illegally.ous towns.
