Private schools are unable to find affordable learning tablets for their pupils. The government started supplying the free Learners Digital Devices to Grade 1 pupils in public primary schools in 2016. Private schools say they face difficuties getting quality tablets with required specifications at affordable prices. The chairman of the Kenya Private Primary Schools Association in Embu, Francis Mbuthia, said the available tablets are quite expensive. The chairman said the schools are partnering with Katridge Kenya to supply them with quality tablets at Sh16,300 each. Mbuthia spoke at Tenri Primary School where Katridge distributed 740 tablets were presented to private schools. He said Equity Bank would assist parents to buy tablets. “When the government promised that all pupils would be provided with free tablets, we realised that private schools had nobody to take care of them,” Mbuthia said. He said already 35 schools out of the 60 in the county havereceived the tablets. Mbuthia called on all remaining schools to place their orders, saying the tablets are of high quality and that all their teachers are computer literate. Katridge business development and operations director Darren Gillen said the firm has employed technicians to repair the devices.
