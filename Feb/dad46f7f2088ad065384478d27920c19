The Sports Disputes Tribunal has stripped the officials of Kenya Squash and Rackets Association the responsibility of running the elections. The incumbent officials had refused to appoint an independent electoral panel to run the election and remained adamant that they themselves will conduct the polls. Speaking before the Tribunal, the outgoing KSRA chairman David Ngunjiri said: "We are the ones conducting these elections; we as the KSRA committee," The latter also told the court that all the nine applicants for the same number of positions did not meet KSRA criteria to vie for office. In addition, from the submission of Ngunjiri, SDT gathered that there were no veritable rules to run the election in addition to (KSRA) being unable to provide an independent panel as required by law to run the election. Consequently, the SDT panel chaired by John Ohaga directed that the petitioners (club captains) should nominate two people to the electoral panel, the outgoing KSRA office to propose the same number and then the tribunal will recommend one. The five will then be vetted for suitability at the SDT on March 5. A date for the elections will be set after this. This will enable the new office to start the Sports Act 2013 compliance process. The Association which has been dogged in wrangles for over a year has had to postpone the elections twice due to oversights of procedures set out in the Sports Act 2013. The latest postponement was on Thursday evening, less than 24 hours to the polls scheduled for last Friday. Last December, the elections aborted after it emerged that the office of the registrar of sports was not involved. Click here for the latest political news
