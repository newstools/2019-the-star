Police in Eldoret next week will exhume the body of a teacher who died last December. Investigating officers yesterday started preparing for exhumation of Veronicah Kemunto’s body. Justice Hellen Omondi on Thursday ordered the exhumation for fresh investigations into the cause of her death. Kemunto’s son Edwin Oginda told the court he doubted the results of the post-mortem performed by Dr William Nalianya, indicating she died of severe cardiac arrest. Widower Elijah Oginda had opposed the exhumation but his lawyer Dennis Magare said they will comply with the court order. “My client wants to put this matter to rest,” Magare said.
