The highest court in Kenya is set to rule on a petition challenging the win of Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti. His win has been challenged by the independent candidate Oyugi Magwanga, who was Awiti's main challenger in the 2017 election. Awiti had moved to the Supreme Court after the Court of Appeal's decision to uphold the High Court's ruling which nullified his win. The High Court ruled that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) did not conduct a free and fair election in Homa Bay. According to IEBC's disputed results, Awiti got 210,173 votes while Magwanga came second with 189,060 votes. The Supreme Court's ruling will determine whether residents of Homa Bay will go back to polls or not. Two witnesses Gordon Owiti and Wilson Okumu said they witnessed voter bribery in the August 8 poll. Awiti, who was in charge of coordinating agents in Kwabwai Ward, Ndhiwa, said he witnessed people perceived to be Awiti’s agents giving voters money.
