Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli and his wife, Mary Kilobi are having a good time in Egypt. The two lovebirds have been exchanging love messages on social media as they soak in the sun nd sights in the ancient land. In one photo, the Tv news anchor is dressed in all red. Atwoli posted the photo with the caption: "I trust you in the city of peace." Chiming in on this, Kilobi responded in the comment section with a love emoji adding, "Peaceful is an understatement! The most beautiful place I have visited so far. Can't thank you enough love." Clearly, the two are enjoying life together and as Kilobi had said in an earlier interview, COTU boss has shown her genuine love and respect that she deserves. "We are very good friends. Anybody close to us knows that we are very inseparable," she said, "He has shown me genuine love and respect that I deserve." Atwoli spoke about his relationship with the KTN screen siren after their marriage came to light in October last year. "She is a nice lady, she is taking care of me, she is committed to our relationship and that’s all," Atwoli said in a live TV interview. Kilobi added in the past interview, "He (Atwoli) said he does not want to be my boyfriend or anything that is not marriage. I reached a point I dated many people and I felt like he treated me so well, respects me and shows me, genuine love.” It is not yet clear whether the couple is on holiday but the fact is that COTU boss also met some top trade union leadership in Egypt at The Intercontinental Hotel in Cairo led by Brother Mohammed Saleem.
