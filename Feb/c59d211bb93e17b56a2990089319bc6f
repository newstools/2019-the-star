Both the national and county governments have been asked to suspend development on a disputed piece of land in Modika, Garissa, after one person was killed last week. Residents accused a “politically connected” private developer of erecting a perimeter wall on the 30-acre property without consulting the “owners” who have lived there for decades. The residents, led by Dadaab MCA Mohammed Abdi Farah, said there has been a growing appetite for land in the outskirts of Garissa town. Farah said they will use all possible means, including courts, to ensure they stop land grabbing. Elder Ismail Haji said many lives had been lost over land disputes. Leaders will not allow that state of affairs to continue, he said. The elder said he has been in the area for 80 years and knows who the land belongs to. He asked the political class to stop using their influence to create animosity among the members of community who have coexisted for many years. Land CEC Mohammed Shalle said the land remains alienated government property and until the government and the National Land Commission conclude allocating it, any structure on it is illegal and should be demolished. The land is 13km from Garissa town.
