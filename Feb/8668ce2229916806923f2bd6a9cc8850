The business community and leaders in Naivasha want the national government to identify the location of the planned industrial park. Members of the County Assembly and residents of Mai Mahiu say they don’t know where the proposed project will be. Senior government officers have given mixed statements on the location of the park and the cargo clearance terminus with some pointing at Mai Mahiu and others to Olkaria. According to Lakeview MCA, Karanja Mburu, the county assembly is in the dark over the industrial park and the cargo clearance terminus. Mburu said that efforts to get more information from the county and the national governments had failed leading to more confusion. “All we know is what we read in the newspaper, the county needs to enact by-laws to protect investors and the residents,” he said. Addressing the press in Naivasha, the MCA termed the project as noble as it would provide employment to hundreds of youths in the area.
