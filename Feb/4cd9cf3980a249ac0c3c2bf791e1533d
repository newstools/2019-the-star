Activist Okiya Omtatah has moved to court seeking to stop construction work by China WuYi Limited along James Gichuru-Rironi highway. Omtatah on Wednesday said the work should not be allowed to go on until the people affected are compensated. The court was told the government has violated the Constitution by failing to promptly compensate those affected by the construction work. Omtatah faulted KeNHA, the National Lands Commission, the Treasury and the contractor for starting the work before sorting out compensation issues.

On April 13, last year, construction of James Gichuru Road was paralysed for four days as employees boycotted work, demanding better pay. The road is being expanded into six lanes on each side for Sh16.3 billion — running up to Rironi area along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. The workers said they are paid Sh40 per hour and work from 8am to 6pm. From this, they pay the NHIF, the NSSF and PAYE. Police teargassed more than 100 workers.
