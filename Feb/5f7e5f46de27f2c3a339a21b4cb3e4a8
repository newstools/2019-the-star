Treasury is yet to disburse cash to the Agriculture ministry as payment for 54,302 bags of 50kg maize that has so far been delivered by farmers. Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri said on Monday the cost of the purchase as at February 7 stood at Sh75.4 million. "To date, we are yet to receive the exchequer so that we can start payment," Kiunjuri said. He spoke in Parliament when briefing the Committee on Agriculture on the progress of the purchase of the 2 million bags as directed by the government. The National Cereals and Produce Board opened its doors on January 23. Kiunjuri said the delivered maize is from small scale farmers with less than 400 bags of maize. “It was agreed that the NCPB buys from small scale farmers with 1-400 90kg bags first,” Kiunjuri said. He added that vetting of farmers with more than 400 bags of maize will start on Wednesday while delivery is expected to commence on February 18. In January, the government authorised the NCPB to buy 2 million bags of maize at a cost of Sh2,500 per 90 Kg bag.

The money is, however, yet to hit the Agriculture ministry's account. “The balance of Sh980,000 will be sourced from the maize sales of 2017/2018,” Kiunjuri said. On January 10, President Uhuru Kenyatta said at least 2.5 million bags of maize from last year's harvest were still in silos. He said 1.7 million bags will be released in the market at Sh1,600 per bag while an additional 300,000 bags of animal feed will be sold to farmers for Sh1,400 per bag. On fertiliser, Kiunjuri said that the government has contracted private dealers to import fertiliser ahead of the planting season. He said the dealers and importers have assured that they have the capacity to meet the demand for the long rains planting season. This year, the government said it won’t import subsidized fertiliser due to procurement obstacles and corruption. Kiunjuri allayed fears that importers may bring substandard fertiliser into the country saying a multi-agency quality assurance team will monitor the exercise. “We have very stringent rules that are being applied by Kenya Bureau of Standards and therefore I want to assure the question of standards is very clear,” he said. Farmers have raised fears that this year's maize produce will be diminished due to the high cost of fertiliser. A 50kg bag of fertiliser is expected to retail at Sh3,000. Last year, the government purchased 100,000 metric tonnes of subsidized fertiliser which was sold to farmers at Sh1,200 per 50kg bag. This was a 33.3 per cent drop from the Sh1,800 farmers bought the fertiliser in 2017.
