Neighbours Uganda boys and girls are the only teams that have so far confirmed participation in the inaugural East Africa Talent Acquisition Program 5-a-side youth tournament. The three-day competition is expected to feature four nations including Seychelles, Tanzania,Uganda and hosts Kenya at the City Park Stadium. Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) secretary general, Wycliffe Ongori said only Uganda have confirmed participation and are expected in the country on Friday. Ongori said: “We are still waiting for other nations to confirm their attendance even with three days to the event kick off. But all in all the preparations are in top gear with events facilitators also expected in the country on Friday.” At the same time, Kenya’s overall teams’ coach Michael Malungu has revealed the nation will field two teams in each gender. Malungu, who was in charge of the boys team during the Youth Africa Games in Algeria last year, tipped hosts sides to excel in both genders, saying they picked important lessons in the youth games that will come in handy in the event. The tactician said the fact the teams have also been training with the provisional national senior sides is an added advantage. “Only nine players are entered in the five-a-side tournament and the turnout has been impressive during the time we have been training. We expect to select strong sides that will challenge for titles in both genders,” said the official. He added: “I’m so happy especially for the boys’ side because we expect to retain most of the players who participated in Youth Games. The boys have grown in confidence and even their attitude is admirable. We hope they will carry the exposure and experience they picked in last year’s event and use it here for better results.”
