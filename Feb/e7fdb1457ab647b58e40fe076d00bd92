The Auditor General's report for the financial year 2017/18 at the Technical University of Mombasa has raised audit queries purchase of five smart TV sets at an inflated cost of Sh4,750,000 in 2015. Five former senior officials have since been charged with flouting procurement procedures. At the time, Josephat Mwatwela was the VC. Mwatelah was removed from the post by then Education CS Fred Matiang'i. He later went to court and was awarded compensation. In 2016, Matiang'i ordered the EACC to commence probe over the irregular TV purchase.

The case is pending in court. A search at the Mombasa Law Court registry shows the last hearing date was November 29, 2018. Some TUM staff testified. AG Edward Ouko in his 2015/16 report said the procurement was done through requests for quotation contrary to the Public Procurement and Disposal Act of 2005. “In addition, the Supplier delivered 65 inch-size instead of the 70 inch - size TV sets as per the supply order,” the report stated then. In the last FY, Ouko said gratuity amounting to Sh6 million was not supported with contract document. Reached for comment on Friday, TUM VC Laila Abubakar said they had already submitted the service contracts of employees as requested by Ouko. “The University further submitted the policy for contract employees for reference on how the gratuity is paid out. The documents were submitted to the auditors but the query was retained without any explanation,” she said. Ouko said there was "over expenditure of Sh294 million on personal emoluments" without TUM council approval. But the institution said there was no over-expenditure that required approval from the council. “Included in the personnel emoluments as at June 30, 2018, is Sh242 million for CBA 2013-2017. The staff salaries were also increased effective July 2018,” Abubakar said. She said this was financed by total disbursement of Sh313 million from the Treasury. “It was, therefore, money that the Government had allocated to the University for the purpose of fulfilling the conditions under the signed 2013-2017 CBA,” Abubakar said.
