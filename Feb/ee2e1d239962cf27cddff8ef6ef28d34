Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has been given 14 days to respond to a suit filed by developer Mike Kamau over a phone call recording about the Kayole demolitions. The matter stalled after Sonkoâ€™s lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui asked the court for more time to respond. In a letter dated February 20, Sonko asked the businessman to serve him with a summons so he could respond. Sonko made the request as he was away on official duties and had not signed the replying affidavits. Justice Msagha Mbogholi granted the application and directed the matter to be mentioned on March 12 to confirm compliance. Kamau, owner of Marble Arch Hotel, accused Sonko of releasing a recording of their phone conversation in which he insulted the businessman, initiating social media attacks that he claims damaged his reputation and image. The dispute started in December after Muthithi Investments Ltd, owned by Kamau, started demolishing houses built on 20 acres in Kayole. The governor, in a leaked private conversation, threatened to demolish part of the hotel, which he said is built on grabbed land. Kamau wants the governor ordered to delete a Facebook post in which he allegedly claims that the businessman misled the court using forged documents.
