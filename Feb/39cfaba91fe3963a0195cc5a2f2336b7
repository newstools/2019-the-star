Doctors thought Tanzanian singer Ommy Dimpoz was suffering from throat cancer, while treating him last year. "I had three surgeries. It was the oesophagus that had an infection and it was removed and a replacement was done in South Africa," he told Mseto East Africa. Dimpoz says 2018 was one hell of a year, as he was in hospital for eight months. "My problem started during Ali Kiba's wedding and Governor Joho was present. He is more of a brother to me, he told me he would help me with his doctors and I was treated in Mombasa for a while, but doctors advised I should be taken for another medical facility," he said. The singer thanked everyone who supported him. He has returned to the music scene with 'Ni Wewe', a song to thank his fans, family and friends and God.
