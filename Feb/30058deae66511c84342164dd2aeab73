Safaricom has announced new 'all in one monthly bundles' that will see customers enjoy discounted data and calling rates in one package. The bundles offer customers a choice of five price options including Sh1,000, Sh2,000, Sh3,000, Sh5,000 and Sh10,000 for a 30-day bundle. Based on their needs, customers have the choice of a data only package, a data-heavy package or a voice heavy package. In a statement on Friday, chief customer officer Sylvia Mulinge said the packages are immediately available on *544#. "This has been tailored to fit the connectivity needs that our customers face today and allow them to plan based on their budget," Mulinge said. Customers who prefer data-only packages can choose from a 5 GB bundle for Sh1,000, 15 GB for Sh2,000 and 25 GB for Sh 3,000. Heavy data users who would also like to discount calls can now choose from 4 GB and 200 minutes for Sh 1,000, 12 GB and 600 minutes for Sh 2,000, 20 GB and 900 minutes for Sh3,000. Safaricom also introduced two new packages offering 35 GB and 1,500 minutes for Sh 5,000 a month and 50 GB and 3,500 minutes for Sh 10,000. "This is to meet the growing demand for data as smartphone users transition to heavier app usage," Mulinge said. Customers who call more will have the choice of voice heavy bundles, starting at 1 GB and 400 minutes for Sh 1,000. Other bundles on this option include 3 GB and 1,000 minutes for Sh2,000; 5 GB and 1,500 minutes for Sh 3,000; 10 GB and 2,500 minutes for Sh5,000 and 20 GB and 7,500 minutes for Sh10,000. All the packages allow customers to enjoy free WhatsApp messages should they exhaust their data before the 30-day period is over. "By offering the choice of both discounted data and calls in one package, we are empowering our customers with even more convenience and freedom in managing their communication needs," she said.
