United States International University’s Martials coach Dennis Mwanja expects a tough game against hosts Kisii RFC in Match Day 10 of the KRU Championship tomorrow. Mwanja said: “We have not played Kisii in the last one year but we expect a hard game. We want to get back to winning ways after losing to Kitale last weekend.” “The team that wants it more will win the game and that team is USIU,” added Mwanja, whose team is placed third on the log with 32 points same as second placed Catholic Monks. Western Bulls lead the log with 33 points after nine matches. He decried poor officiating and asked the Kenya Rugby Referees Association to address it urgently. “Officiating in the lower leagues in Western region is poor and it should be addressed,” he said. His Kisii counterpart, Eric Bosire is hoping to lift the former Kenya Cup side from relegation after dishing out two walkovers against South Coast Pirates and Egerton Wasps. “We have not played for three consecutive weeks and this is likely to affect my team. We are not in a good position currently which is worrying. We are heading to Nairobi for a win,” said Bosire who steered the team to Kenya Cup in 2017. The cash-strapped Kisii-based team is 9th on the log with 14 points. Kisii lost their Resolution Insurance sponsorship and chairman Adrian Monari says they are negotiating with potential sponsors to come on board. Leaders Western Bulls travel to Njoro in Nakuru hoping to maintain their lead when they tackle Egerton Wasps. Wasps last week got a walkover after hosts Kisii failed to provide a playable pitch.
