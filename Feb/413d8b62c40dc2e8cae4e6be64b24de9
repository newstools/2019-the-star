Luxury hotel Radisson will open a 233-room outlet in Nairobi’s Arboretum area in September after construction delays last year. It will house a hotel and apartments to cater for long and short stay guests. “Our third outlet will complement two other hotels, with our target being the business traveler who may want to stay longer or a leisure traveller who wants to tour and stay in a place close to the city centre,” senior vice president development Andrew McLachlan said in an interview. It has a portfolio of 96 hotels and over 20,000 rooms in 31 countries open or under development in Africa. The group plans to get to 130 hotels by the end of 2022 in a five year growth strategy. “We plan to scale our growth in specific cities where we think there is demand. Last year we surpassed our target by adding 16 hotels to our portfolio against a target of eight. We will continue with the same aggressiveness in 2019,” McLachlan said. The group is also eyeing two additional outlets, in Nairobi and Coast, having classified Nairobi as the most proactive market in East Africa which can host between three and five hotels due to the demand. It also wants to partner with local businesses to set up in the safari business. Most hotels are concentrated in Nairobi to cash in on business travellers and conference tourism. Tourism Sector Performance report 2018, recorded 2,025,206 international tourism arrivals, 37.3 per cent higher than 2017 attributed to withdrawal of travel advisories.
