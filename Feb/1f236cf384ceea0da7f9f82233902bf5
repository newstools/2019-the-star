American comedian and writer Phoebe Robinson is super-excited to be visiting Kenya next month for the first time ever. "I don't know what to expect, because this is my first time to Africa. I feel like I'm gonna cry like Oprah. I might also hug everyone the Wakanda way," Phoebe told Trevor Noah on the Daily Show. Phoebe will also be doing some charity work in the country. "I've teamed up with Red and One organisation that was formed by Bono. I have been involved in charity work for a while, and this time I thought of talking to them and how they raise money, how they're trying to get drugs over to Africa, so I really wanted to be on the ground and see like where that money's going so I can speak about it in a more like intelligent way, and a full way," she said. She will be coming with a bunch of donors as well. Phoebe is a regular contributor to Glamour and has written several books, including 'You Can't Touch My Hair (And Other Things I Still Have to Explain)', which debuted on October 4, 2016.
