The standoff between Nairobi county workers and the Salaries and Remuneration Commission has headed to court as strike enters its second week. Kenya County Government Workers Union secretary Benson Olianga told the Star the union had received a letter from SRC asking officials to appear before Labour Court on Monday. "As a union, we don't understand it. Currently, there is no case and the reason why SRC has taken us to court is not clear," he said on Monday. Olianga said the letter indicates that the case will be before Justice Maureen Onyango of the Labour Relations Court. "As a union, we will go to the court because we want to hear what the SRC says. This is new because I have never heard of an intended interested party in a non-existent case," he said. Last week, Olianga said the union met Labour CS Ukur Yatani in an attempt to resolve the matter but was unsuccessful. Yatani said the standoff between the SRC and workers was a unique case because it lacks the element of a disagreement between the employer and employees.
