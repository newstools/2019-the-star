Kenya Sevens half-back Johnstone Olindi will miss the Las Vegas Sevens tournament this weekend, owing to visa issues. Olindi, who has been one of the outstanding performers in the team this season despite the poor results, could however, play in the Vancouver leg slated for March 9-10 in Canada. Head coach Paul Murunga will have to rejig the back line without the teenage sensation who has been in superb form for the side. His absence from the side could see Mwamba’s Daniel Taabu start at fly-half with Blak Blad’s Brian Wahinya starting at scrum-half this weekend. Head coach Paul Murunga was optimistic about Kenya’s chances without Olindi for this weekend. “We do have depth in that position and Olindi’s absence is a major setback. All the same, we have to move on. It’s out of our control and the players must rise to the occasion and deliver,” he added. The team arrived in Las Vegas on Sunday and had a gym session on Monday and Tuesday with tactical work next. Murunga was delighted to have forward Herman Humwa of Quins and utility back Michael Agevi of Mwamba back in the squad for the two tournaments. “Both players bring experience and should be able to give us a platform in set pieces and defend well,” he added. Murunga termed the pool matches against France and Argentina as winnable. “We have a good chance against France and Argentina, We have beaten both teams and so we just have to get our execution right and take our chances in both games. Shujaa play hosts and defending champions USA in their first match. The Las Vegas pitch is narrow and not a standard size rugby pitch but Murunga said it will not be hindrance to their structure and play. “We have to adapt and play to our strengths in order for us to get victories,” added Murunga. Last season, Kenya reached Cup quarters at Las Vegas only to be knocked by Argentina(17-12) before losing 21-26 to Australia in plate semis. Shujaa lie 13th with 12 points from four tournaments.
