Kenya Sevens seek more points as the World Sevens Series heads to Sydney this weekend. Shujaa should expect a sold out Allianz Stadium in Sydney for the explosive days of action down under. Paul Murunga’ s charges bagged seven points after losing to England 36-7 in the Challenge Trophy final last weekend in Hamilton. Kenya had beaten France 19-15, Tonga 19-12 and Argentina 36-7 to qualify for the final. Kenya open their campaign against Canada in Pool ‘B’ at 1:44 am this morning and it will be the first encounter between the two sides. The Canadians are a physical side and qualified for the main cup quarters last week in New Zealand. Key players for the North American outfit include veterans Justin Douglas, Nathan Hirayama and John Moonlight. Shujaa will then face inform USA at 7:34am. Mike Friday’s charges have reached three successive finals and will start the match as favourites. Kenya complete their preliminary matches against France at 11:17am. Kenya beat the Europeans 19-15 last weekend after a 21-17 and 19-12 loss in Dubai and Cape Town in December respectively. Shujaa skipper Jacob Ojee said they are an improving side and will have nothing to fear when play starts today. “The boys are in high spirits and are confident after last weekend’s outing in Hamilton and we can get better,” added Ojee. He said the side has acclimatised to the soaring temperatures in Sydney. “We have adjusted accordingly and we are ready for the fixtures,” he said. Head coach Paul Murunga said he expects the side to be competitive. “We are taking one game at a time and I am excited with this team. They have no fear and are doing the country proud with their displays,” he added. Murunga said the side is not getting carried away and will want to get improvement in all facets of play. “There are still some areas which the team needs to work on like the kickoffs and defence,” he noted.
