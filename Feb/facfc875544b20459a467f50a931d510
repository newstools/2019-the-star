Nyeri and Embu are set to reap big from the upcoming sixth devolution conference with host Kirinyaga lacking enough accommodation space. Governor Anne Waiguru on Tuesday said although the county does not enough boarding facilities, they have incorporated neighbouring counties of Embu and Nyeri to provide more accommodation and catering services. More than 6,000 guests are expected to attend the four-day event between March 4 and 8 at Kirinyaga University in Kutus town. "We are not talking about big hotels only, even our medium level hotels will benefit by providing catering services to our guests during the period. They can make a killing if they position themselves well," she said. Waiguru said she has also engaged security agencies to ensure security is not compromised. She told hoteliers to give quality services for guests to enjoy their stay. President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga are among key leaders expected to attend. Waiguru urged the guests to enjoy the serene view of tourists sites in the county such as God's Bridge (Ndarasa ya Ngai), the Castle Lodge at the bottom of Mt Kenya in Gichugu constituency, and the Mt Kenya peaks. Most high-end hotels in Kirinyaga are located in Sagana, Ndia and Mwea constituencies which have a serene view of mother nature including the major rivers in the county. The last devolution conference was held in Kakamega when Waiguru was the Council of Governors' deputy chair.
