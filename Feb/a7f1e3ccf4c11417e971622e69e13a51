Two Tanzanian beggars who were convicted for being in the country unlawfully without a valid permit will be deported. Samuel Paul Masanja and Margaret Yohana pleaded guilty on Tuesday before Narok resident magistrate Adeline Sisenda. They were ordered to remain in custody until they are handed over to immigration officials. The court was told that the two, who were beggars in Narok town, were in the country illegally to solicit for funds from well-wishers because they have disabilities. "The culprits will remain in custody of the police until they are handed over to the immigration officials for deportation to their country," ordered the magistrate. They were arrested on February 12, 2019, at around 12 noon in Narok town after the residents informed the police of their presence. The suspects had earlier been released on a Sh150, 000 bond as the DCI sought for time to carry out investigations. The East African Community (EAC) allows citizens from its countries to live and work in either of the countries but with requisite documents such as passports, work permits and residence permits as specified by law. According to the Ministry of EAC, it is estimated that there are more than 500,000 Tanzanians living and working in Kenya. In 2005, the EAC also launched the Customs Union Protocol, meant to unify tax laws and removed many of the levies charged on goods. One year after this Protocol, trade within member states rose from Sh166 billion to Sh332 billion, according to the Ministry of EAC. However, the reality is that each of these countries has its own internal laws that seem to contradict or slow down the implementation of these protocols. Click here for the latest political news
