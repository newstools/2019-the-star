The Catholic University of East African dean of the students is battling a case in which he is charged with assaulting a female foreign professor during a committee meeting at the institution's boardroom. Samuel Nderitu is accused of beating up his colleague Dr Rosa Ko after the two disagreed on the increased number of untrained instructors in the institution. A charge sheet in a Kibera court indicated that Nderitu committed the offence on October 3, 2018, at the university in Karen division. Rosa then reported the matter at the Hardy police station and after investigations, the accused was arrested. Rosa was by then the Assistant Professor in International Relations. She was fired after the incident. Nderitu denied the charges and was freed on a bail of Sh30,000 or a bond of Sh50,000 with a surety of the same amount. The prosecution intends to call three witnesses to testify when the next hearing will commence. The case will be heard on March 20. Click here for the latest political news
