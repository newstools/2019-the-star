A 38-year-old man on Wednesday killed his father with a fork jembe after he was denied Sh6,000. Daniel Kamau, who is said to be mentally unstable, killed John Maina at the old man’s Silanga farm in Passenga, Ol Kalou. He told the neighbours that he found his 67-year-old father dead and that he did not know who the culprit was. “But I noticed he had a cut in his hand and I asked him how it happened. He said he got injured while starting his father’s car to take his body to the mortuary,” neighbour James Mwangi said. Villagers went to Maina’s home and confirmed that he was dead. He had head cuts. Kamau confessed he had killed his father when the police arrived. He said he committed the offence after the father allegedly became hostile after he asked to be given Sh6,000 to buy food. “He insulted me yet he knows I get mad. We decided to fight to see who could beat the other. I took the fork jembe and hit him hard. I then took the knife and cut his neck,” Kamau said. “I was angry because he told me to go to Murang’a and ask for money from my mother. Now I feel good. What else can you do when he is dead? Even if I am taken to court, I will admit I killed him,” he said. A neighbour said Kamau has been quarrelling with his father for a long time. He is lazy, the neighbour added. “When he asks for money and the father declines, he beats him up,” he added. Kamau is in custody at Ol Kalou police station. The father’s body is at J.M. Memorial Hospital mortuary. While condemning Kamau’s action, Passenga chief Daniel Muniu urged the youth to learn to work instead of waiting for free things. They should not force their parents to give them property. Elsewhere, a 30-year old man killed his father over Sh100 on Monday. Eric Kibiwot hit Wilson Chepkicho on the head with an axe in Elburgon after a quarrel. Kibiwot had asked his father for Sh200, but was told that only Sh100 was avalable.
