The courts annex mediation programme was launched on Friday in Garissa. Mediation is part of a wider scheme to decongest the courts. The programme is similar to common Somali traditional conflict resolution. However, it is not allowed to handle criminal cases such as treason, murder or rape. Garissa High Court presiding judge George Dulu said the process will only be lawful after the cases are filed in court. They must be allowed to proceed to the final stage, all pleadings closed and a decision reached. Dulu said the programme will help to decongest the courts as most cases will be solved quicker in a cheaper and manageable way. Experts say the process is less expensive and swifter compared to the court process. The programme was launched nationwide in 2016. Magistrate and deputy registrar of the family division at the High Court Mukabi Kimani said since then more than Sh3.8 billion, which had been locked up in litigation, has been released to the economy. This was after warring parties agreed to settle out-of- court He said all the logistics and structures on the ground have been set up and urged community support.
