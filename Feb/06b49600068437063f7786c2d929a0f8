Poor trading activities at the Nairobi Securities Exchange saw investors incur a year on year loss of Sh420 billion in paper wealth, the latest quarterly bulletin by Capital Market Authority shows. According to CMA Q4 2018 statistical bulletin, the bourse recorded market capitalization of Sh2.1 trillion in three months to December last year compared to same period in 2017 where it posted an impressive Sh2.52 trillion. Luke Ombara, director regulatory policy and strategy at CMA attributed the slowness to high foreign outflows brought about by volatility in international trade. “The growth in US economy and increase in Federal Reserve Rate attracted high value investors from emerging markets. US trade wars with China and Brexit uncertainties affected saw investors develop cold feet,’’ Ombara said. This saw the country record a net foreign portfolio outflow of Sh6.67 billion during the quarter under review compared to net inflow of Sh182 million witnessed same period in 2017.The Annual net foreign portfolio flow for 2018 was an outflow of Sh22.96B compared to a net inflow of Sh11.53 billion in 2017 attributed to foreign investor flight from the local capital markets. He added that Kenya’s stock market demonstrated more resilience compared to her African peers with equity market turnover in 2018 improving slightly by 2.36 per cent to post Sh175.6 billion compared to Sh171.61 billion traded in corresponding period in 2017.
