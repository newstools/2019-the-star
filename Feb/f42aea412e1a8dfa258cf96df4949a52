Speedy national women’s team forward Esse Akida is embracing her new position as a right back with four goals on her name at the Israel side, Hapoel Morasha Ramat HaSharon Football Club. Akida, a natural forward, left the country late last year after signing six-month deal with the top side and renewed her contract with the club last month with an option of renewing it again. Akida, a former player of women’s Kenya Premier league side Thika Queens, said the new position will give her options going forward. “Back home, I play as a forward but here I’m fielded as right back and so far it has been amazing. I have scored four goals which is a good thing and something to be proud of,” said Akida. She added: “I’m glad I have renewed my contract with the club. The fact that I play in almost all the games has continued to boost my confidence and I can only get better. Besides, my hope and prayer has always been to play in the Uefa women’s Championship League and I believe this is a step towards it,” Asked about her stay in the team this far, the former Spedag player said: “ It goes without saying that language has been a barrier. On most occasions, I have been forced to use a translator but I’m adapting well. I’m happy my teammates received me well and the club as a whole has been very supportive.” She added: “Unlike back at home, where the women’s matches are not aired, here most the games are beamed live and sometimes you can get reviews on Youtube. That really helps when it comes to reviewing your play as you seek to improve on your shortcomings,” The 26-year-old who loves sukuma wiki, Ugali and goat meat has been forced to eat rice and pasta.
