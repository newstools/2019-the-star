Ijara MP Sofia Abdinoor wants the Sh100 billion Northeastern Development Initiative to benefit all wards. The government programme to be funded by a Sh10 billion World Bank loan targets marginalised counties. It aims to attract investment and complement government efforts to reduce poverty. Yesterday, Sofia questioned why Hulugho and Sangailu wards were left out, saying the decision was “discriminatory and has no justification”. “Whom are you leaving these areas for? Are they not part of Kenya? Issues of insecurity are global. They shouldn’t be a reason to deny development,” she said. The lawmaker spoke during a meeting of Garissa leaders at a hotel. Governor Ali Korane, MPs and other leaders discussed the projects. They called for public participation. The national government has guaranteed the loan. Beneficiaries include Garissa, Lamu, Tana River, Isiolo, Marsabit, Wajir, Mandera, West Pokot and Turkana counties. Some projects will run across several counties. The Northern Corridor Road, for instance, traverses Lamu, Garissa, Marsabit and Mandera. The government will harness and distribute solar energy, build abattoirs, markets, health centres, schools and youth centres. Garissa Township MP Aden Duale said the projects will improve livelihoods and change lives. “The projects will ensure residents have electricity. The meat processing unit will be upgraded to modern standards.” Senator Yusuf Haji and MPs Mohamed Hire (Lagdera), Abdikarim Osman (Fafi), Mohamed Dahiye (Dadaab) and Abdi Shurie (Balambala) also attended.
