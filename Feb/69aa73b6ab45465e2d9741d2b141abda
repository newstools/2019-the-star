A man has been arraigned in Kwale for denying his children the right to education and medical care claiming it is against the will of God. Tumaini Hamisi, a member of Good News International Church in Likoni says education is satanic. He was arrested at his Sheep village in Matuga sub county on Monday. Hamisi said it is against his faith to take children to school saying education is not God's plan. "Learning does not require one to go to school, it only requires the holy spirit," he said, adding that he knows how to read because of the spirit. Hamisi also does not take his children to hospital when they fall sick because he believes "the holy spirit will heal them". The father of four vowed to defend his faith even if it means going to jail. Matuga OCPD Joel Cheshire warned parents who are not taking their children to school on religious grounds that they will be arrested and prosecuted. "We will not hesitate to take the law on parents denying children right to education for whatever reason whatsoever," he said. Click here for the latest political news
