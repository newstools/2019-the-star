Knut Secretary General Wilson Sossion has cautioned the Teachers Service Commission against deducting Sh500 monthly from teachers’ salaries. Sossion said TSC must negotiate with teachers if it needs any amount of money from them to finance anything. “There is that teachers' professional development module that is being developed which they want to force teachers to pay every month Sh500 from their earnings... a salary is negotiated,” Sossion said. He spoke during the Knut Machakos Branch Annual General Meeting at the Machakos University on Friday. “If you want a war that has never been seen in this country, take away the promotional rights of teachers. TSC should not try, they have an opportunity right now so that we can agree,” Sossion said. The union leader said the TSC should instead put a budgetary allocation to promote teachers. He said they will also be demanding that every ECD child across the country receives capitation. Sossion said the government should even stop funding primary and secondary schools and instead invest on ECD. He criticised the Jubilee administration for pushing for the 100 per cent child transition with little funding of public primary and secondary schools. “100 per cent transition has brought congestion in classrooms, laboratories, toilets among others. You are making these children's lives difficult. What’s the government doing to ensure that it works?” the SG posed. Sossion claimed that public schools are "dumping grounds" of young learners so that the government gets international glory that it has achieved 100 per cent transition. He said the teachers' Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) should be reduced from four to two years to make it achievable. Click here for the latest political news
