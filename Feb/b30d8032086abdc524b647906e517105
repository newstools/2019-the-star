Police lines in Mombasa have neither electricity nor running water after they were disconnected last month over unpaid bills. Officers who spoke refused to go on record because they are not authorised to talk to the press. Close to 1,000 officers and their families have also been caught up in the confusion after President Uhuru Kenyatta abolished free police housing and introduced house allowances. The officers were given 90 days to vacate. House allowances for police constables in Nairobi were set at at Sh18,124 per month. Those in Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru, Meru, and Uasin Gishu were to receive Sh13,124 per month. Police constables in other counties were toget Sh8,124 per month to cater for housing needs. But the amount is in dispute. While others reported not receiving the money, some said it was insufficient. “The Sh13,124 has not reflected on my pay slip,” one officer living in Mbaraki police line said. He said their salary won’t cater for their needs if they are forced out. He said because of his large family, the least he can spend on rent is Sh18,000. Police have always complained of poor pay. Another officer said she has not found an alternative housing.“Everywhere you are looking for a rental house, you are turned away. No one wants to live with police,” she said. Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich has already terminated leases swith landlords in police estates. The government last year planned to put up 1,850 units in the pilot phase of comprehensive strategy to improve the living conditions of police and prison staff. Water vendors were selling water at Central and Dog Section lines yesterday. County commissioner Evans Achoki said commanders in lines are responsible for the welfare of officers.
