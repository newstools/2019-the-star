A man being sought over an Sh18 million compensation by the family of businessman he killed in a road accident has lost bid to be declared bankrupt. Albert Mbogori who served time for manslaughter had pleaded with the court to declare him bankrupt because he didn't have means to pay the compensation to the family of Edward Rahedi. However, Judge James Makau dismissed his application for bankruptcy saying there is no sufficient evidence placed before the court to prove Mbogori's financial status. The judge noted that Mbogori said he operated a KCB account for the last six years but never brought to court any bank statements. Mbogori had also said that he held property in trusts for his children. However, it later emerged that the same was transferred to the children before he filed for bankruptcy. The property is in Langata and has a rental house on it. Justice Makau faulted Mbogori for not supplying any particulars on the said property and dismissed his application saying it was meant to avoid a jail term and had nothing to do with his inability to pay the award.
