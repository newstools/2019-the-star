A battle for the kitchen between two major pot manufacturers that went to the Competition Authority of Kenya has been settled. Kaluworks, associated with millionaire and philanthropist Manu Chandaria, has been absolved of dominance accusations by its rival Sufuria World. Sufuria World which manufactures and distributes aluminium cooking pots, filed a complaint with the Competition Authority of Kenya in December 2016 complaining that Kaluworks had refused to sell to them aluminium circles. However CAK in its ruling said that Sufuria World had the ability to replicate the technologies used in the manufacture of the products or order to a capacity that Kaluworks can produce. “Premised on the findings, it was concluded that the allegation did not meet the threshold of abuse of dominance,” ruled CAK. It said Kaluworks did not refuse to deal under the Essential Facility Doctrine or infrastructure necessary to reach customers or enabling competitors to carry on with business. In refusal to deal cases by dominant firms, CAK said it is necessary to prove indispensability of the facility to the operation of the complainant or other third parties as arbitrary intervention may hurt innovation. It said Kaluworks’ primary duty is to produce aluminium circles for in-house production for a variety of cookware products intended for local and export markets. They could, however, manufacture the circles to third parties upon placing an order which meets certain minimum quantities that guarantees optimal scale of production. CAK noted that out of the eight manufacturers of aluminium cookware products in the country, three companies source the materials from third parties. But the kitchen ruling has not given respite to Kaluworks, which has still to contend with auctioneers over bank debts running to Sh6 billion. I&M Bank which is one of the creditors has already published notices for auction of the company’s assets. The company is also indebted to NIC Bank and Bank of Baroda.
