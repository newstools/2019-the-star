Radio Jambo presenter and comedian Terence says Churchill Show comedian Ayeiya's death, which happened on the day of his ruracio, was one of his lowest moments. "I received messages that he had breathed his last," he told Word Is on Sunday. "I do not even want to talk much about it. It was and it still is the saddest day of my life because he was a brother and a friend." However, the ruracio went on well, as it was happening in Eldoret. The late comedian, born Emmanuel Makori Nyambane, died two years ago after his car hit a pole near the Catholic University of Eastern Africa on Magadi Road, while coming from a show at Carnivore.
