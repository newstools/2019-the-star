President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday said he looks forward to the day Kenya will have its first female Head of State. “I pray to God and look forward to the day that I shall be sitting and listening to the first female President addressing the people of the Republic of Kenya,” he said. “Some of my best ministers are women. Women understand the basis of servant leadership. Women understand that it is dedication to the family and the country that matters.” Uhuru was speaking when he briefly joined First Lady Margaret Kenyatta who hosted at least 2,000 girl guides and their leaders during celebrations to mark this year’s World Thinking Day. The function, held on State House grounds, was attended by Education CS Amina Mohamed and her Public Service counterpart Prof Margaret Kobia. Uhurs said Kenyan women, especially the young ones, have a great future and potential. They should always strive to bring out their best qualities. “Nobody should put you down because you are girls on the excuse that you have no capacity,” the President told the women and girls. He said leadership in the family and the country does not exist without the full participation of women. “What really matters is the commitment to the family and the country,” he said.
