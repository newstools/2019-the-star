Wazito coach Mohamed Ahmed Mchulla wants his team to maintain consistence in their performances as they seek a return to the Kenyan Premier League next season. Speaking after the team’s 4-0 win over struggling Green Commandos on Wednesday, Mchulla said: “The players work as a team both in training and during games. I’m happy with the teamwork and hard work but my only prayer is that we remain consistent.” The youthful Mchulla was also impressed with the team after scoring four past the hapless Commandos at Bukhungu Stadium. Derrick Onyango scored a brace with David Oswe and Dennis Gacheru scoring a goal apiece for the promotion favourites. “We have been wasting a lot of chances. I’m happy that we have started converting the many chances we get because goal difference is very important in this closely contested league,” he added. Last weekend, Wazito FC President Ricardo Badoer challenged his players to score more goals and they responded against Commandos. He also challenged the team to lift the SportPesa Shield Cup. Following the win against Commandos, Wazito opened a three point lead on top of the log after second placed Ushuru played to a barren draw against St Joseph’s Youth at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru. Ushuru remain second with 31 points while Nairobi Stima moved to third after Amos Wekesa gave them a 1-0 win over bottom of the table Kangemi All Stars.
