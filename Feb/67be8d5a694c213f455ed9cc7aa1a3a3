National Super League side, Green Commandos have appointed former Western Stima tactician Fred Serenge as the new coach as they seek to evade relegation The national women’s Under-23 coach will now take over the struggling Commandos and among his immediate priorities will be to ensure the Kakamega-based side moves up the log from the current second last position. Until his appointment, Serenge was serving as the head coach of Bishop Njenga Girls High School team. Serenge, who witnessed Commandos’ heavy 4-0 defeat to Wazito FC on Monday, revealed that he wants to turn around things and take the team back to the winning ways so that they can move from the relegation zone. “As the only team from this region playing in this second tier league, we call on each stakeholder to come on board and support us. We have youthful players in the team and with the addition of experienced players, we will be sure bounce back. “Those, who have been serving the team are still welcome to contribute in whichever way possible because we want to remain united for the sake of the club as we try to come up with measures on how we can resurrect the sinking ship. I believe this being our second time in this league, we need not to be struggling.” “For those who have put trust in me and think that I can add value, I want to thank them and assure them of my commitment and loyalty to the team. We shall work in unity and ensure that the team is back on it’s feet,” Serenge said. The outgoing tactician Eliud Omukuyia, who served the team the whole of last season is now sitting on the technical bench of Kakamega Homeboyz to assist the acting coach-player Allan Wanga as they shop around for a new coach. Serenge will work alongside a pool of other coaches who will handle the youth sides.
