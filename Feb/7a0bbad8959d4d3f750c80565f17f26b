Professionals and from Mikauni village, Mwingi North subcounty, have come together to revive Mikauni Dispensary to serve children of the Kaundu School for the Mentally Handicapped. Cconstruction started in 1990 but stalled. The group has launched a WhatsApp wall to raise funds. “Two children developed complications and succumbed as their relatives were looking for means to take them to a hospital,” Joseph Mwandikwa said on Sunday. He is the chairman of the committee that is mobilising funds for the project. He said his group has organised a massive fundraiser at Mikauini for the revival of the project on March 2. He added that the dispensary would be handy to treat pupils in nearby institutions like Kaundu Primary and Secondary schools. About 4000 community members will access the facility, he said. “We want to ensure that the objective of community leaders who came up with the idea of setting up the dispensary does not go down the drain.” A visit to the desolate facility revealed that the project was nearly complete when it stalled. Elder Muisyo Mbiti said appeals to the then Mwingi County Council to fund the project through the Local Authority Transfer Fund failed.The local CDF kitty was not helpful either, he said.
