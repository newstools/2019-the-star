A video has surfaced online of Mary Wambui, who was murdered, telling Kenyans facing challenges that God is in control. She disappeared on January 26, and her body was found the following day at Courtesy Beach in Juja. Wambui's husband Joseph Karue, 41, and his lover, Judy Mungai, are accused of murdering her. Police are holding them. In the video that surfaced days after her brutal murder, Wambui, 39, tells people challenges never last forever.
