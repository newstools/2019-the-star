The court has confirmed earlier orders barring Meru Senator Mithika Linturi from evicting his estranged wife Marianne KitanyÂ from their Runda home. Magistrate Isaac Orenge said the orders will remain in force until the divorce case in Meru is heard and determined. Immediately after the ruling was read, Linturi urged the court to suspend the order to allow him lodge an appeal. But the magistrate declined and directed he files a formal application. Linturi and his wife met, fell in love and got married quietly in the corridors of power. However, the lovebirds-turned-bitter enemies are headed for a nasty split after Kitany formally filed for divorce. Kitany, a former powerful Chief of Staff at the Office of the Deputy President William Ruto wants their union dissolved for cruelty, neglect, infidelity and desertion. According to the divorce papers filed at the Chief Magistrate's Court at Meru, the two were married in a ceremony under Meru and Nandi customary law on April 16, 2006 at Kapchemosin village, Nandi County.
