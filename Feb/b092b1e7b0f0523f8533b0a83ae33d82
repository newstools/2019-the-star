Mandera plans to upgrade its subcounty hospitals to level 4 in readiness for the roll-out of universal healthcare coverage. Governor Ali Roba yesterday told the county assembly that his administration is committed to quality health services. It will equip the facilities and increase specialties. “We’ll continue to build on the achievements of the last six years. But we’ll invest more in making facilities operational, equipping all new facilities and improving services,” he said in his State of the County address. “More staff will be recruited, drugs supplies increased, referral systems improved and the number of ambulances in service increased,” Roba said. The administration will allocate more resources to the water docket. Over six years, it has invested Sh8.5 billion in the sector. The county has drilled boreholes, built water pans and installed 120 large underground tanks in centres. “Before devolution, Mandera was one of the most water-insecure places in Kenya. During the dry seasons, we lost a lot of livestock and people to drought and extended dry spells. This is now a thing of the past,” Roba said. He said access to water has improved from 57 per cent to 72 per cent over five years. The national government is funding the Sh2.5 billion Mandera Water and Sewerage Programme in partnership with the African Development Bank. The project is underway and is to be completed in August next year. Roba said the county has invested more than Sh4.4 billion in food production over six years.
