Citizen TV anchor Lilian Muli says she is not proud of what she posted on social media, terming her baby daddy Jared Ombongi a community husband. "My recent outburst was my lowest moment, and I am not so proud of it because I had Kenyans speaking about it," she said in an in an interview with Malkia Africa. Lilian, however, says she has learnt from her previous mistakes and looks forward to being cautious on her comments on social media. "I think sometimes I underestimate my brand, even with the knowledge about social media power, especially now. As a word of caution to any upcoming brand, anytime you are emotional, take your time before posting anything on social media," she said. Lilian admits it was a bad moment for her, but she has managed to solve it and moved on. "I can't say it did not happen but I have made peace that it happened. If I could take it back I would, but I cannot act like it didn't happen 'cause, of course, something that I am not proud of happened that made me react that way," she said. "I have made peace with myself and with the affected persons because some of these things affect even the family. I am a weak person but I am learning. I hope the affected will also make peace with me as well and even forget about it."
