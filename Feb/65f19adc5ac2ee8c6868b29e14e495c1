Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has proposed an amendment to the procurement law to compel the government to pay tenders for women, youth and persons living with disabilities within 30 days. He also wants payments for other categories to be made in 90 days after receiving invoices and certificates for procurement. If the proposed amendments are passed, accounting officers will face criminal proceedings in their personal capacity for professional negligence and misconduct in case they fail to pay within the stipulated time. "At the expiry of the allowed period for procurement, the procuring authority shall issue the suppliers with a revocable promissory note valid for a period not later than 24 months from the date of issue. Such note shall be used as a financial instrument by any licensed bank and may be traded on the secondary market," Kuria said in a notice to Speaker Justin Muturi. He also wants the procuring authority to meet the cost of any interest rate that may be accrued on such an instrument. Kuria said the objective of the amendment is to protect suppliers and national and country governments as well as public entities, especially the small and medium enterprises. Last week, Kuria accused Majority leader Aden Duale of frustrating most of his private bills by ensuring they do not get to the floor of the House. Kuria reiterated his earlier claims that Duale is plotting to have him de-whipped from both the Transport and Budget committees.
