Killer cops, even celebrated ones, are increasingly finding themselves behind bars, serving prison terms, or awaiting them. For years Kenyan police have been a law unto themselves and while it may be too early to pronounce that justice prevails, sustained pressure from the public and rights groups, and meticulous investigations have helped bring rogue officers to book. Though justice has been slow, the number of police officers charged and convicted for extrajudicial killings and the number of pending court cases gives hope. Celbrity cop Titus Ngamau Musila alias Katitu Convicted in April last year for gunning down Kenneth Kimani Mwangi on April 14, 2013, at the Githurai 45 bus stage, accusing him of being a thug. Musila was the darling of Githurai resident for being a crime buster. Residents staged demonstrations and battled police to demand his release. Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko posted Sh1 million for him. Supporters said he had been framed by civil society groups, yet he had rid the area of criminals. High Court Judge James Wakiaga sentenced the officer to 15 years in prison, ruling that Musila fired the bullet. He said the issue was not about police officers ridding estates of criminals but how they do it.
