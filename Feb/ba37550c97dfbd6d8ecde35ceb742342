Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has given concerned officials a two-week ultimatum to ensure construction of the roads pledged by President Uhuru Kenyatta begins. Kuria, who is also the vice chair of the Roads Committee in Parliament, said if the ultimatum is not honoured, he will lead demonstrations to ensure the Kianyaga - Kiamutugu - Kithure road is tarmacked. “I'm giving the Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KERRA) and Kenya Urban Roads Authority 14 days to resolve the endless paperwork and begin constructing the road, we cannot have a Presidential directive ignored," Kuria said in Kirinyaga. “We want the road completed so that it can open up tea, coffee and macadamia zones to the world. Farmers need to have easy access to markets and consumers.” The MP spoke during a tour in Embu, Mbeere, and Kirinyaga where he held talks with local leaders, the clergy, professionals and traders. He also held rallies in a meet the people tour accompanied by MCAs. "We cannot allow some people to make the President look bad. The President launched the construction work for the Kiamutugu road during the then Devolution CS Anne Waiguru's homecoming ceremony,” he said. KeNHA and KURA are responsible for the management, development, rehabilitation, and maintenance of international trunk roads. “As a leader, I will stand with my people at home in Mount Kenya and in the whole world. I will defend them all the time and push for their interests,” he said. Kuria also wants the two road authorities to immediately begin the process of procuring and design of the PI - Njukiini road. “The role of Parliament is to allocate funds and we did allocate funds. We want results,” he said. Click here for the latest political news
