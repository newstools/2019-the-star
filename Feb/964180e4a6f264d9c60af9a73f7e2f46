At the height of national divisions during the 2017 election period, rapper Majirani started Majirani FC in Eldoret county. He told Word Is football was the only way he could unite people from all tribes. "As an artiste, I thought of a way I could involve all tribes. I went for the youths and they listened to me and decided to start a football club. I bought one ball and went to town and talked to a few people there," he said. There was some idle land around the town on which he started a team of three, but later others started joining. "After three weeks, we realised we were already 50 people. That is how football cut across," he said. Majirani chose footballÂ because the sport would help jobless youth stay away from crime. Since he knew little about federation, he sought advice on everything. "That is how we registered our team. I spent some money and bought uniforms for my team and more balls," Majirani said. Majirani said it was not easy to support it as an artiste, but he had a strong drive to succeed. "I am passionate about soccer and dealing with youths. I want to help youths to at least get somewhere with their talents. Majirani is known for the hit song 'Ivo Ndio Kunaendanga'. "It is two years since my last project because of some challenges, plus the passion on the club. I want the club to be stable then go back to the industry," he said. Majirani advised the youth to share new ideas to also help others in life.
