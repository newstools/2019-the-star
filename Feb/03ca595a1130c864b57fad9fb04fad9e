At least 2,000 residents of Kangemi were left homeless after a fire razed down their shanties. The cause of the Tuesday night fire remained unknown but residents believe it was started by a burning jiko that was left unattended. More than 400 structures were gutted in the Kaptagat village fire. There were no casualties. Beretta Muhende, 72, narrated how she was rushed outside by her grandchildren as residents scrambled to salvage valuables. “We were preparing supper at about 8:30pm when we heard people screaming,” Muhende said. Their shanties were on the other end of the slum from where the fire broke out. “Everyone was shouting fire, fire, fire. We rushed out before the fire caught us,” she said. Muhenda is a small-scale charcoal seller. She said her new stock from Uganda was destroyed. “The fire spread so fast making it difficult to rescue anything. I’ve lost two gas cookers, a TV set and clothes belonging to my children and grand children,” Muhenda said. Village chairman Isaiah Waweru said it took two hours for Nairobi City firefighters to arrive at the scene. He said families would have rescued their belongings had the firefighters arrived in good time. “This is not the first time we’ve had a fire case. We would like to call upon City Hall to have a firefighting machine nearby for quick response,” Waweru said. He thanked neighbours for evacuating those who were stuck in their houses. “We’re appealing to the government and well wishers to help us put up new structures for our children to get shelters,” he said.
