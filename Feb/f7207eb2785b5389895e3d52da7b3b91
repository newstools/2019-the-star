Westerners may be targeted by extremists in Nairobi, Naivasha, Nanyuki, and coastal areas of Kenya, the United States has said in its latest security alert. "We strongly recommend that US citizens travelling to or residing in Nairobi enrol in the Department of State’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program," the embassy said on Monday. STEP enrollment gives foreigners the latest security updates and makes it easier for the US embassy or nearest US consulate to contact you in an emergency. "If you don’t have Internet access, enrol directly with the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate," it added. The U.S. Embassy reminded the public of the continued need for heightened vigilance throughout Kenya, especially in public spaces such as shopping malls, hotels, and places of worship. This comes after an attack in Westlands hotel in January which claimed the lives of 21 people, including a GSU officer.
