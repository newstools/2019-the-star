Makolanders are unmoved with the absence of speedy forward Neddy Otieno ahead of the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) women’s Premier League set to start next weekend. Atieno, a national team player, will not be part of the side that finished eighth last season with reports indicating that she has joined her employer’s side Ulinzi Starlets that was formed last year. Makolanders coach Mike Okanga said they are not worried, adding that they usually do not rely on individuals but team work. “We are currently training and very much okay as we try to strengthen every department. Neddy left and that’s not a problem for us. We have a cover for that. Hope all goes well because I anticipate a better structured side than last season,” said Okanga. He added: “Neddy is not a subject to my team performance. In fact during last season, she played four matches only and really you can see we coped well. She is a good player and any team would want to have her services but my motto has always been not to embrace teamwork and not rely on individuals. Having said that, I wish her well in her future endeavours because she served us well during the time she was here.” In the absence of the former Tartar High School player, Okanga will rely on Dorcas Vihenda and Amy Lasu to duties for the side that is eyeing an improved performance this season. Okanga said: “Vihenda and Lasu did well last season and with two more signings, I think we will be good to go. The season will definitely be tough but we are equally prepared and ready for the season.” Makolanders will begin their title hunt with a match against former champions Thika Queens on February 24 at Camp Toyoyo.
