CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge has said that the majority of Kenyans have less than Sh1 million in their bank accounts. Njoroge spoke on TuesdayÂ when he appeared before the Parliamentary Committee on Finance. He further defended banking regulations that require full disclosure of cash transactions exceeding Sh1 million. The CBK boss told MPs that less than 0.7 per cent of bank accounts in Kenya have a balance of more than Sh1 million. He said the regulations as enshrined in Section 33c of Banking Laws are in line with the International Anti-money Laundering regulations. Njoroge said if Kenya goes against global measures by doing away with Section 33c, the country will be cut off from the international financial fabric.
