Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) has petitioned MPs to intervene and have more teachers recruited saying the, “statistics from the teachers’ service of commission over teacher shortage are inaccurate.” The union’s Bomet branch executive secretary Malel Langat said the recently released figures of teachers demand by county was ‘discriminatory’. While particularly taking on the legislators from the county over their inaction over the matter, Malel said the statistics by TSC was not fair at all as teacher deficit in the region was much higher as compared the number released. He also lashed at the commission’s subcounty directors for presenting wrong figures saying such did not represent the real situation on the ground. “We want equal sharing of these opportunities…some counties are given more opportunities but here in Bomet we are given a few slots and this has been the trend for years,” he noted. Speaking to the press at his office, the unionist pointed out that from Knut's records there was a shortage of 3,055 teachers for secondary in Bomet as compared to 2, 133 of TSC. In primary, he noted there was a shortage of more than 2,000 teachers. “We have five members of Parliament from Bomet who happens to be teachers but they are doing nothing.” He, at the same time, said as Knut, they were opposed to the move by TSC to employ teachers on contract.
