More than 500 nurses in Busia on Friday called off their strike, bringing to an end three weeks of suffering by patients in the Western county. The decision was made after successful talks between union officials and the county government led by Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi. Addressing the press after a four-hour meeting, Mulomi who is also acting Health CEC said the county has initiated the issuance of promotion letters to deserving nurses which will be concluded on April 4, 2019. The county also agreed to establish the office of Director of Nursing through following all laid down procedures and in accordance with the scheme of service of nurses. Mulomi said the nurses will not be victimized for participating in the strike, adding that the union had agreed to suspend the strike from February 25 to April 20 as per the court order. KNUN Busia Branch chairman Isaiah Omondi thanked Governor Sospeter Ojaamong’s administration for exhibiting the willingness to solve the stalemate. Omondi said already 140 promotion letters have been issued and they expect 200 more nurses to be promoted in the prescribed time. Busia now joins Kisumu, Bomet, Murang'a, Kisii and Embu counties whose nurses called off their strike this week.
