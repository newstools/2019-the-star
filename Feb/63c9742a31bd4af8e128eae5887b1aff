A man and his son have been arrested for allegedly attacking and injuring a police officer. Boniface Obunga, 48, and his 22-year-old son Collins Oremo were arrested on Saturday morning. They stoned the  officer who had gone to arrest them in Homa Bay town two weeks ago. Senior assistant chief Tom Ondiek said the two pelted the officers with stones when they wanted to arrest Seth Aluoch, their relative, at Kapita estate. The relative was involved in land row with a neighbour in the town. “A suspect threw a stone and hit one of the jaws of the officer and dislocated it,” Ondiek said. The police officer is still being treated at the Homa Bay County Referral Hospital. Father and son went into hiding after the incident occurred. On Sunday, Homa Bay Town OCDP Sammy Kosgey said the suspects were separately arrested in different parts of the town. “They had disappeared after realising police were looking for them. We found them hiding in different houses,” Kosgey said. He said the officer sustained serious injuries during the attack. Two of his colleagues  sustained minor injuries. “They are detained at Homa Bay police cells. We’re interrogating them and expect to arraign them as soon as we complete investigations,” he said.
