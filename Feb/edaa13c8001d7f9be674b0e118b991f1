Women's lobby group Fida is still trying to reach out to a woman who accused two gospel artistes of infecting her with an STD. The 20-year-old accused DK Kwenye Beat and Hope Kid of infecting her with Herpes intentionally, something that has caused her much anguish. Speaking to the Star, Fida CEO Teresa Omondi said they are doing all they can to get in touch with the woman for free legal services. "She has not reached out to us and we have not been able to get her contacts. However, we are still trying to contact her just in case she still wants to get legal assistance," she said. "We can only proceed with this if she has given us consent. So far, we have no instructions from her to proceed, and that means we have nothing to work with at the moment. "As Fida, we cannot reach out to the gospel artistes to ask them if it is really true they infected the woman or not, given that such investigations are mainly carried out by the DPP." Asked how they came to the conclusion they would pick up this case, she said: "For us what matters is that there is a woman whose rights have been violated and she needs our assistance. In this instance, we had a lot of tags from Kenyans. "We do NOT force or coerce someone to let us offer them legal assistance, it is a personal decision. What we mainly do is show them we are there for them in case they need our help."
