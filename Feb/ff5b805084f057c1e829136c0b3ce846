Kenya reigning World Boxing Council (WBC) super bantamweight champion Fatuma ‘Iron Fist’ Zarika left the country on Tuesday evening for the United Kingdom to prepare for her eagerly awaited rematch bout against Zambia’s Catherine Phiri slated for March 23. The two boxers, who last fought in Kenya in December, 2017, are scheduled to fight again in Nairobi in a night event that will also feature celebrated Tanzanian Super Welterweight boxer Hassan Mwakinyo. Zarika said she will employ new skills to counter Phiri. “My previous match against Phiri was hard, so I expect a tougher match this time round,” said Zarika. Zarika and Mwakinyo will both be in the UK for training until March 16, courtesy of their sponsor, SportPesa. Mwakinyo is scheduled to arrive in the UK early next week. They will be trained by a different set of trainers within the same gym in Liverpool, UK. Mwakinyo’s opponent will be determined later. While in the UK, the boxing duo will also get a chance to be mentored and trained by British boxer Tony Bellew. SportPesa chief marketing officer, Kelvin Twissa, urged Mwakinyo and Zarika to use the valuable opportunity to polish their skills further. “These are two very talented boxers and as SportPesa, we wish them well. We have put a lot of resources behind them to ensure they return from the UK ready for their respective bouts,” Twissa said. Twissa urged East Africans to throw their weight behind the two and prepare to turn up in large numbers in Nairobi for the biggest annual boxing event. Venue for the Nairobi fight will be announced later.
