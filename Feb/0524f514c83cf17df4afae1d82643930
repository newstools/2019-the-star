The Public Accounts Committee is heading for a three-day retreat starting today to write a report on its investigations into IEBC operations during the 2017 general elections. Chairman Opiyo Wandayi yesterday said they will convene in Machakos for the compilation of the probe they have been conducting for months. The probe followed an audit that revealed how billions were lost in procuring goods and services for the August 8 polls. About Sh9 billion is feared lost at the commission during the planning and execution of the August and October 2017 polls. "In writing this report, PAC will endeavour to put the record straight whilst keeping to its policy of impartiality and objectivity," Wandayi said. PAC will, thereafter, table its report on the floor of the House on February 28 for debate and adoption. The investigation was conducted against the backdrop of Chebukati’s letter to the Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji seeking that former CEO Ezra Chiloba is investigated and subsequently prosecuted over the claims. PAC invited Chiloba, Chebukati, among other critical players in the 2017 poll to appear before it. Those summoned gave their account which will form the gist of the expected report. At the height of their row, Chebukati issued a 12-point memo to the now sacked CEO, demanding answers to problems leading to the nullification of the vote. The explosive memo contained details of how the commission purchased satellite phones worth Sh848 million for results transmission — they never worked. Click here for the latest political news.
