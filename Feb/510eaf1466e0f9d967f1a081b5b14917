Nema has indefinitely suspended the construction of Oinonobmoi-Barwessa-Kinyach road in Baringo over environmental pollution. The oversight agency said SBI International construction company has failed to suppress excessive noise and dust to acceptable standards. The county's Nema director, Josiah Nyandoro, said he reached the decision after receiving complaints from residents. “Some even reported to us that wind blows the dust into their homes hence putting them at risk of contracting respiratory diseases,” he said. He said soil excavated from the road has been heaped close to water streams and might lead to contamination. Nyandoro said the contractor did not carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment before rolling out operations in August last year. He gave the contractor until February 28 to comply with Nema standards or face court action. Efforts to reach the contractor for comment were futile. officials of the firm were said to be held up in a meeting. The 36km road is classified under the Kenya Rural Roads Authority.  It connects Barwessa, Kaptara and Kinyach to Kabarnet, Eldoret and Nakuru towns. Some residents do not seem bothered by the dust and noise. They are more eager to have a tarmacked road. Isaac Chepturo from Muchukwo village said, "We knew there would be dust and noise but we chose to preserve because we knew normal life will resume after the road is completed." He was backed by Andrew Chirchir, Isaiah Biwott and Elijah Kangogo. Baringo North MP William Cheptumo praised the villagers who complained to Nema, saying it is their right. “After receiving the information I pushed SBI, Nema and KeRRA to have a meeting over the environmental concerns,” he said.
