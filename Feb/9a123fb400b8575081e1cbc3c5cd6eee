At least 109,296 students who sat last year’s KCPE exam have not reported to secondary school. Data from the National Education Management Information System shows 920,765 (90 per cent) of the 1,052,334 students had been admitted to secondary school as at Sunday. It is the highest ever transition and pushes the number of learners in secondary schools to 3.8 million. Last year, the ministry achieved 81 per cent transition. Read: 100% transition plan impossible – Knut Education CS Amina Mohamed last week launched a drive to ensure all candidates who sat last year’s KCPE exam join Form 1. The ‘Last Mile Form One Admission Campaign’ towards 100 per cent transition sought to trace those yet to report to school. The drive ends on Friday. Nemis showed 813 candidates opted to repeat Standard 8 while another 5,760 candidates jined vocational training institutions. Nyeri, Siaya, Bomet, Nyandarua and Kajiado counties led in the transition with all registering over 97 per cent. Most of those who failed to join secondary school are from the Coast. Data shows that more than 50 per cent of those yet to be admitted are from Taita Taveta, Kilifi, Nairobi, Mombasa, Lamu, Kwale, Tana River and Isiolo counties. The counties registered less than 80 per cent transition. Amina blamed poverty, insecurity, teen pregnancies and backward cultural practices such as early marriages for the ‘low transition’.
