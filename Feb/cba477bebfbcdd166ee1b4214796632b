Kenya’s Mercy Moim faces race against time to be fit for her side Supreme Club ahead of their Saturday’s match against Quint Airforce in Thailand league. The left attacker, who signed a six-month deal with the Thailand side last month, sprained her ankle last Saturday during their defeat to Thai-Denmark Khonkaen Star. Moim, who has featured in almost all the eight games for the league champions, said she hopes to be fit in time for the match. “I have played in almost all the matches and that shows the believe the technical bench here have in me. However, it’s unfortunate I sprained my ankle and this might lock me out of the two remaining matches ,” said the Kenya national women’s captain. She added: “I will be able to know my situation after getting the report from the team doctor. But for now, I’m just doing basics with no jump as we monitor the injury.” The mother of one said her aspiration is to play in the Super League, where her team has featured for the two editions and won both titles. She said: “We currently occupy second position on league log and my prayer is for the team to win the two matches and a book a place in the play-offs and go all the way to defend the title and qualify for the Super League.” She continued: “I’m looking forward to play in the Super League and the Asian Championship. It’s at that level that my game will grow and definitely learn from the best.” Asked about her stay in Thailand so far, Moim said her stay has been worthwhile. “Here people eat sea food. I’m not big on it and I’m thankful I can access chicken and rice. At least team’s captain and some of officials speak English and so I haven’t had issue with communication,” noted the former Cheptil Secondary School player. She added: “Unlike back home where league matches are played monthly, here a team can play two to three matches in a month and that keeps the players in shape.”
