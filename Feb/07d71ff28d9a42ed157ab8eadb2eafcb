World under 20 champions Rhonex Kipruto and Edward Zakayo renew their rivalry as they seek tickets to the national cross country trials when the various Athletics Kenya regions make their selections this weekend. Representing Elgeyo Marakwet, Kipruto, the U20 10,000m title holder and Zakayo, the U20 5,000m champion, face off at the Maralal Sports grounds where they will encounter junior runners from Trans Nzoia, West Pokot, Turkana and hosts Samburu. This will be the first time Samburu will be hosting the championships with action set to start at 5am due to hot weather conditions expected later in the day. “We have to host the championships as early as possible to avoid dehydrating athletes due to the high humidity being experienced in the region,” said Bonface Tiren, Athletics Kenya (AK) North Rift public relations officer. In Central Rift, Commonwealth Games 10,000m bronze medalist Rodgers Chumo Kwemoi will lead a star-studded field of Uasin Gishu team as the battle for slots in Team Kenya to the World Cross Country Championships in Aarhus, Denmark on March 30 enter penultimate stage. After missing out on 2017 world cross country trials due to injury, Kwemoi will be seeking to redeem himself at Ravine Sports ground, Baringo County. The former World U-20 10,000m said: “I failed to compete at the 2017 national trials because I had minor complications but I am coming back with a bang.” Chumo will face competition from Nandi and Baringo county athletes for a ticket to the national trials which will be held at the Eldoret Sports Club on February 23. Top athletes from Bungoma, Kakamega, Busia and Vihiga County will converge at Ebunangwe Sports ground in Vihiga County for the AK Western Region championships. Regional acting chairman Patrick Kipsang said: “We had successful county championships and we expect to get a good team for the national trials.”
