The title deed for a Sh4 million piece of land that was deposited at the Malindi law courts as surety in a fraud case is missing. Detectives from Nairobi are investigating how the title deed disappeared. The document was deposited to secure the release of three suspects charged with defrauding the late Mombasa tycoon Tahir Sheikh Said, popularly called TSS, of Sh28 million. The accused are Zein Mohamed, James Muturi and Aweys Mohamed. The three appeared before Malindi chief magistrate Julie Oseko last November. They were charged with forging a letter of offer for Kenya commercial Bank with the signature of Said. The three allegedly committed the offence at Jane Wanjiru Kogo Advocates on August 25, 2014. They denied the charges and were released on Sh3 million bail or Sh4 million bond. Two court officials from Malindi law courts were arrested last week. Police sources said the suspects were arrested in connection with the missing surety and later transferred to Mombasa for further interrogation. But the police said the court officials have been released.
