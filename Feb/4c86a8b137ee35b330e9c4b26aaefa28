Nurses are on strike or have threatened to go on strike across Kenya. This is despite President Uhuru Kenyatta’s warning yesterday that nurses will be dismissed unless they return to work. The nurses’ union says they are within their rights to strike but last week the Labour Court suspended the strike to allow for negotiation. Everyone would like to be paid more but nurses are well paid compared to other public servants. A diploma nurse earns around Sh75,000 compared to a graduate architect or engineer in the county administration who earns around Sh47,000. The Salaries and Remuneration Commission is reluctant to see any nurses’ pay rise implemented because it will imbalance pay grades in the public service and lead to a ballooning wage bill. But the SRC has itself contributed to the crisis by delaying its job evaluation report for the health sector. The constant pursuit of increased packages by MPs and MCAs has set a bad example for public workers. But two wrongs do not make a right. The nurses should call off their strike.
