President Uhuru Kenyatta will tomorrow present new equipment and projects at the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital. Governor James Ongwae yesterday said Uhuru’s visit will be his first since he was reelected. The President will launch the Kisii University’s School of Medicine, he said. The county signed an MoU with Kisii University to operate a medical school at the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital. The curriculum has been approved by the university’s senate and the school is ready to admit the first students. Ongwae said his administration wants to make the facility the best. It serves five counties — Kisii, Nyamira, Migori, Homa Bay and Narok. The facility handles up to 2,500 outpatients daily. Uhuru will also preside over the groundbreaking ceremony for construction of a cancer diagnostic and treatment centre. It has been funded by the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (Badea) and the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) at Sh2.25 billion. Other projects include a 250-beds male ward, a mortuary with a ca pacity of 100 bodies with histology and anatomy laboratories, a hostel for interns and visiting doctors, a borehole, a CT Scan and a medical waste microwave to dispose of hazardous materials. “He will lay a foundation stone for a new mother and child health facility, which will be put up for Sh150 million,” the governor said. The county has advertised the building of a doctor’s plaza. “This will enable specialised doctors to serve the patients within the KTRH,” he said.
