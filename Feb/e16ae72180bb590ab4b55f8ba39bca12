Turkana pastoralists have protested an increase in the levy on animals at the Lodwar market by the county government. Livestock sales have gone down drastically following the signing of the 2018-2019 Livestock Bill that has increased the levy to above 100 per cent. The pastoralists led by County Livestock Marketing Association chairman Joseph Losuru said the new Bill was drafted without their input. "The new livestock Bill has increased the cost from Sh20 to Sh100 for small animals, Sh100 to Sh250 for camels and cows. Losuru said the Bill also increased the cost levied by the county government for movement of animals and the county Cess fee resulting in heavy losses for the pastoralists. "Before the passage of the Bill, Lodwar Livestock market was capable of selling 10 to 20 trucks of livestock but currently not even one truck is sold in a day," Losuru said.

Jackson Lele, the association's Treasurer said the county should revert to the previous rates of Sh20 charged on small animals and a flat rate of Sh100 for the big animals. "County government should respect the plight of pastoralists who are selling their animals to buy food and pay some school fees for their children," chairman of the Kailimngorok Sale Yard James Apao said. The Livestock market officials want the Bill reviewed to incorporate the pastoralists' opinion. Also read; Migori traders refuse to pay county levies Click here for the latest political news
