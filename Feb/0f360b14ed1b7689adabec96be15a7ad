The Anti-Counterfeit Authority has arrested several people over the sale of Sh3 million fake Samsung products in Nairobi. Batteries and phones were impounded during the raid on Tom Mboya Street. The authority said the devices are usually imported as Unitel or Calsen Mobile and rebranded as Samsung by retailers on arrival in the country. The raid was carried out by the authority and Samsung brand protection officers on Tuesday. “Some of the counterfeit goods confiscated this morning include Samsung phones with removable IMEI stickers, which is not the case with authentic Samsung smartphones,” the authority said.
