Yesterday the US Embassy in Nairobi put out an alert that "credible information" indicates that "Westerners may be targeted by extremists in Nairobi, Naivasha, Nanyuki" and the Coast (see P8). This virtually covers all 'white' people wherever they go in Kenya and whatever they do. The Nairobi embassy may be over-reacting in the absence of the experienced ambassador Bob Godec who ended his tour in Kenya last week. The warning is so general that it does not serve any useful purpose. Before Christmas, the Kenya police warned of possible attacks on shopping malls. That guided the public to be vigilant when shopping. But here the warning is that you may be targeted as a Westerner whether you are visiting a conservancy in Nanyuki, a beach hotel in Mombasa, or attending a conference in Nairobi. The only way to respect such a blanket warning is by leaving Kenya, or not coming to Kenya. The American embassy should be more precise in its advice. This alert is so general as to be almost useless. Quote of the day: "We shall win only by working together.” Gnassingbé Eyadéma The Togolese military dictator died on February 5, 2005
