Two men and a woman were on Saturday night shot dead by police moments after carjacking a matatu on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. Three of their accomplices escaped with gunshot wounds. The incident happened near Naivasha prison and officers recovered items stolen from passengers. Naivasha deputy OCPD John Kwasa said officers were received a tip off from residents. “We managed to recover a toy pistol, 10 mobile phones, a laptop, IDs and other personal effects," he said. Police have launched a manhunt for the escapees and members of the public have been told to report anyone spotted with a gunshot wound. The police boss said the group is suspected to be behind a series of highway robberies in the area. Saturday's incident came a day after another group of passengers was robbed on the same highway while on their way to Nairobi. In both the incidents, two passengers, including a woman, boarded a matatu in Nakuru at night and asked to be dropped off at a spot near Naivasha town. Her accomplices then struck once the matatu stopped. John Kinyanjui, a victim during the Saturday incident, said a man and a woman boarded the matatu in Nakuru town. He said when the matatu reached Mithuri estate in Naivasha, the two asked to alight. Five gun-toting thugs then appeared and took control of the vehicle. “They drove us to an abandoned quarry off the highway and robbed us. They used our phones to transfer cash to their phones,” he said. Kwasa urged matatu operators to be vigilant. “In all the robberies, the passengers said a woman with a tattoo on her arm was the main culprit and tonight we have managed to catch up with them,” he said. “In the last one month we have recorded similar cases of carjacking along the Nairobi-Nakuru and Naivasha-Mai Mahiu highways and we believe that this will now end."
