An aide to Deputy President William Ruto has been roped in the Sh21 billion dam scandal which is under active investigations by Kenyan authorities. Ken Osinde is on the DCI radar after a company he is associated with is suspected to have played a role in the multi-billion tenders for construction of Kimwarer and Arror dams in Elgeyo Marakwet. He is listed as a director of Sanlam Company, which is part of the 107 whose directors have been summoned to record statements with the police. Detectives are probing why the firm was paid Sh47 million by Italian firm CMC di Ravenna – which is said to have pocketed billions of taxpayers’ cash for work not done. DCI George Kinoti says the investigation is centred on whether the firm insured the non-existent project at the expense of taxpayers.
