Radio Africa Group have been pitted against AC Nielsen, Resolution Insurance, Beiersdorf, Jubilee Insurance and Catholic Relief Services in Pool ‘D’ of this year’s edition of the Standard Chartered ‘Road to Anfield’ tournament set for Saturday at St. Mary’s School. Radio Africa team captain Brian Ndung’u said: “Looking at our record in the tournament, you’ll notice a decline from 2015 onwards. We are determined to erase that jinx as our target this time is to reach semis. Otherwise, we’re well prepared for the event.” “Winning every game will be key to our success and therefore we have to take every match as a final. Apparently, the only team we’ve faced before is Resolution Insurance; the rest are purely new opponents,” the skipper added. The Westlands-based team have never won the tournament but were finalists in 2016 and 2017, losing to Standard Group and Capital FM respectively, before being knocked out in the group stages last year. Defending champions Wananchi will not defend their title since they did not register for this year’s event, while 2017 champions Capital Group will face Madison Insurance, Simba Corporation, MET Cannon, Zamara and PWC in Group E. The winners will travel to Anfield UK, the home of Liverpool for the Standard Chartered Trophy final in May.
