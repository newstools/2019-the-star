Miraa farmers from Nyambene in Meru have demanded an explanation on expenditure of Sh2 billion allocated to improve the sector. President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered the funds allocated in 2017. Farmers have lost market as the UK, the Netherlands, Tanzania and other countries have banned miraa. Farmers want the Miraa Implementation Task Force appointed to oversee the sharing of the funds to explain how the cash was used. They said money was diverted to projects such as sinking boreholes which are under the mandate of the county government. The task force has denied the claim. “Why would the task force enter into such projects without consulting farmers? It is misappropriation of funds,” James Mithika said. Mithika, a former parliamentary aspirant for Igembe North, spoke at a meeting at Laare Social Hall. He said the funds ought to have been used to establish a miraa research centre at Laare market to promote value addition. “Enhancing research on appropriate chemicals for eliminating harmful insects is far better that digging boreholes,” Mithika said. Task force chairman Joseph Mutharimi said the money was safe. “Not a single penny has been spent,”Mutharimi said. Farmers called for the establishment of marketing strategies to source for international buyers.
