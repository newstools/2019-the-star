Nairobi region girls’ hockey defending champions Mt. Larvena coach Edward Mukonambi has cited Moi Girls, Parklands Arya and Buruburu as their biggestv threat ahead of the regional games set for March 9-10. Mt. Larvena beat Moi Girls Nairobi in the final last year to proceed to the national showpiece in Embu. Mukonambi acknowledged that his charges are bracing up to face well prepared and wounded opponents. “Moi Girls, Parklands Arya and Buruburu Girls are or main adversaries but we are well prepared for the challenge,” he noted. He said their rivals are not very happy that they lost last year and Mt. Lervena is aware of the kind of opposition that awaits them. He admitted that the fact that they had lost their first 11 players poses a major challenge. “The task that lays ahead is harder given that all the first 11 players in our last year’s lineup graduated from High School. The non-futuristic approach while putting together the team is bound to bite since our side lack experience and continuity. A bulk of the current team is in form two, six in form three and three are candidates,” he noted. Mukonambi said: “We had to start from scratch immediately after last year’s nationals. We have players from each class to ensure continuity. We don’t want to repeat the mistake we did preceding last year.” Mukonambi is happy that even though his squad did not come out of the group stages at the 2018 nationals, at least 80 per cent of his players have been drafted into league teams and universities with Joy Mwangi making it to the national junior team. Meanwhile, Mt. Larvena hockey team will be hosting Mary Hill High School in a friendly match this weekend.
