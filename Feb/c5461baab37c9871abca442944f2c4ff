The effect of the Nairobi county workers' strike was evident on Wednesday when a mother was forced to hold her dead six-month-old son for hours owing to lack of morgue attendants. Immaculate Auma told the Star she took her sick child to Mbagathi Hospital but unfortunately, he passed away. "I have brought the body to the morgue and I have been waiting for the last two hours," she said. Auma said she found the offices closed and there was no one to attend to her. It took the intervention of the media and human rights activists for the morgue attendants to help the weeping mother. The dead infant had been suffering from pneumonia. Auma's mother Liner Atieno told reporters her grandchild died while being treated by a doctor at Mbagathi Hospital. However, she said the doctor refused to admit the body to the morgue. "He referred us to the nearby Kenyatta police post to collect an OB number," Atieno said. The county workers' strike entered Day Two on Wednesday. Aggrieved workers held demonstrations and faulted the Salaries and Remunerations Commission for objecting to their negotiated CBA. The workers assembled outside City Hall and threatened to march to SRC offices to demand their salaries. The unionâ€™s chairman Samuel Muguiri condemned the workers who have refused to join them in the strike. "We are here to tell those workers who are in City Hall offices to stop being traitors and come out and join us," Muguiri said. He also told the SRC to state the salaries that the workers should be paid. The workers are demanding a collective monthly salary increment of approximately Sh110 million which was to be effected at the beginning end of January this year. They include sweepers, contractors, cemetery workers, mortuary attendants as well as those responsible for planting trees, cutting grass and unblocking drainages.
