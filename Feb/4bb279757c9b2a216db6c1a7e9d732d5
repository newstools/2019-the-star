Carolyne Mwatha of the Dandora Community Justice Centre had been missing since last Wednesday while investigating extrajudicial killings by the police. Now she's been murdered. You start an investigation by looking for a motive. The police had a motive to kill Mwatha because she was documenting their crimes. So the police is the primary suspect in the public eye. The police have told human rights groups that they think Mwatha died as a result of a botched abortion. They say they know the doctor. If so, why have they not arrested the doctor? Normally a woman takes time to die after a botched abortion. Why was this so sudden? Why have the police not yet gone to the alleged clinic? The police had refused to brief the family because they would leak details of the investigation to the media. Is this just an excuse for a cover-up? The police must do better with their investigation of the murder of Carolyne Mwatha if they want us to believe that they were not involved. Quote of the day: "Remember the dignity of your womanhood.
