The Commission on Revenue Allocation has accused the Treasury of slashing allocations to the counties despite growth in economy. Chairperson Jane Kiringai said the ministry has been favouring the national government to the disadvantage of counties since 2014. “Counties are not feeling growth in the country’s Gross Domestic Product. In fact, the higher the growth in economy, the less counties receive,” she told the Senate Finance committee. Kiringai presented her views on the draft Budget Policy Statement for 2019-20. Allocation to the counties in 2014 was 4.6 per cent in relation to the GDP but dropped to four per cent the following year despite the GDP improving by 30 basis points from 5.5 per cent to 5.8 per cent. In 2016, funds to the counties in relation to the GDP dropped to 3.7 per cent, 3.4 per cent in 2017 and three per cent in this financial year. The economy on the other hand grew from 5.4 per cent to 6.1 per cent in 2018. According to 2019-20 budget statement, the government has projected a 6.2 per cent GDP growth but slashed county funds by 2.7 per cent as a measure of the GDP. The government expenditure is expected to increase from the current Sh2.51 trillion to Sh2.7 trillion. Allocation to the executive is expected to grow to Sh1.76 trillion from Sh1.69 trillion in the current financial year while the Judiciary will receive Sh16.93 billion, marking an increment of 14.28 per cent. Parliament will be allocated Sh36.2 billion, a decline of 1.6 per cent compared to this year’s budget. The CRA says that although allocation to the counties will increase to Sh310 billion from this year’s Sh304 billion and a subsequent rise to Sh318.06 billion and Sh326.33 billion in 2020 and 2021, the amount is low when measured against economic growth. The amounts allocated are, however, in tandem with a constitutional requirement that compels the Treasury to allocate at least 15 per cent of total revenues to the counties. The Finance committee chaired by Mahamud Mohamed promised to ensure harmony in revenue allocation to both levels of government “We are going to upgrade CRA’s mandate from a mere recommender on matters revenue allocation to actual involvement to ensure harmony in resource allocation to national and county governments,” the senators said.
