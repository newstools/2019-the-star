ODM yesterday told off lawyer Kipchumba Murkomen, saying there exists no mechanism to appeal the decisions of the party’s National Executive Council. Malindi MP Asha Jumwa and her Msambweni counterpart Suleiman Dori hired the Elgeyo Marakwet Senator to fight their expulsion from the party. The two, in a letter copied to ODM’s National Governing Council, said there was a complete disregard of the constitution of the party in the manner and style the disciplinary committee arrived at the decision to expel them. But in a letter to Kipchumba yesterday, party secretary general Edwin Sifuna said ODM will not admit strangers to any of its internal deliberations on the matter. “It is frankly embarrassing for your clients to claim to be champions of the values and aspirations of ODM when they have no basic knowledge of the constitution of the party,” Sifuna said. He said Juma and Dori have drifted from the mothership and that their expulsion was a matter of the party’s internal process and its membership. “We strongly suggest that you and your clients take time to familiarise yourselves with the constitution and rules governing ODM to save yourselves from such ignorant misapprehensions in future,” he said.

He said any association with the government including DP William Ruto was in line with the initiative and an exercise of freedom of association. ODM’s National Executive Council last month adopted the disciplinary committee’s recommendation to expel the two rebel MPs. The duo was further dewhipped from all parliamentary committees.
