The government has appealed to public health departments in urban areas to inspect meat in butcheries and expose unscrupulous butchers. Meat inspection has reduced the theft of donkeys for slaughter, but thieves are now targeting cows, Lari deputy county commissioner Aaron Koros said. “Public health officials have to inspect it (meat) and establish all supplies to butcheries,” Koros said yesterday. He said a butcher’s body was retrieved from Bathi dam in Kijabe on Sunday afternoon. He drowned as he and five others tried to escape after they were found slaughtering two heifers in the forest.
