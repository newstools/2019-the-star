Baringo Central MP Joshua Kandie has joined his colleagues in criticising the impending take over of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport by Kenya Airways. Kandie said they will not allow this to happen whatsoever. "It will never work even if it means going to court we shall do so," he said. The MP spoke on Saturday after issuing Sh40 million worth of school fees bursary at Kituro in his constituency. He said KQ's claim that taking over the management of the airport will give it a national outlook as the pride of Kenya is a fallacy.

"I am seeing the whole plan as a gimmick by some a selfish group of cartels to rob Kenyans," he said The MP added that instead of eying to run the airport, KAA should aspire to sell its shares to JKIA and help boost its dwindling fortunes. "I have travelled far and wide and I have not seen anywhere in the world a private company allowed to run a state-owned corporation even in America or Germany," Kandie said. On Thursday, the National Assembly’s Public Investments Committee ordered a halt to the take over the process and ordered a probe into the issue. The Public Investments Committee heard that the take over was being crafted by people “a high office”, seemingly individuals within the Cabinet or close to the presidency.
