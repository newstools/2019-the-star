Artistes in Kisumu want the county government to involve them in talent search programmes, saying previous plans sidelined them. Kisumu Arts and Culture Guild secretary general Boniface Akatch told the press: “We are not against the idea but all we want is involvement of the public, especially artistes.” Guild member Jane Nyoremo added: “We don’t want cases where artistes are being used as ladders for selfish individuals to make money.” Transform Empowerment for Action Initiative (TEAM) director Collins Owuor said many young talented youth in the county have been neglected. He told the county to establish an arts council to tackle problems facing the sector. “We have many talented people in Kisumu who should be mentored to improve on their living standards,” Owuor said.
