Media personality Dennis Okari has found love a second time tying the knot with his fiancee Joy Naomi in a colourful ceremony at a church in Nairobi. Okari dressed in a grey suit patterned with black was seen kissing his wife on Friday in a location that was not made public. In the low key wedding, a few of Okari's and Naomi's friends were seen joyfully following the event. They posted pictures of the happenings at the church vicinity. Sources said that the invite-only wedding was arranged so secretly that even some of the guests were not aware of the venue as late as Friday morning. All the attendees were required to produce invitation cards before accessing the venue.
