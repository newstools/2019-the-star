Embu professionals will visit poor performing schools to motivate students. Embu County Professionals’ Development Association said there was a lot of potential yet schools performed poorly. The association’s chairman, Ibrahim Mwathane, on Saturday said it was unfortunate that the county produced only one A in last year’s KCSE exam. He said there was no way the county will become industrialised if it was not producing adequate skilled manpower. “We’ve decided to be visiting primary and secondary schools starting with those performing poorly in exams. We’ll advised students on career choices,” Mwathane said. He said the mentorship programmes will start on February 15 with secondary school visits beginning on March 1. He was speaking at the University of Embu when the association was launched. The event was attended by county commissioner Abdulahi Galgalo, Speaker Josiah Thiriku, University of Embu vice chancellor Daniel Mugendi and Mbeere ACK Bishop Moses Masamba. The professionals promised to provide free multi-sectoral clinics to residents to help them to find solutions to their problems. Mwathane said the majority often suffer in silence due to lack of knowledge on simple problems. Gagalo praised the group, saying the motivation will improve education. “You should not allow this association to be infiltrated by politics,” Galgalo said. Thiriku said the county assembly will seek expertise advice from the professionals before passing technical bills.
