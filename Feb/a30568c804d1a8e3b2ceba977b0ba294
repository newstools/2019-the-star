A title deed of land worth Sh4 million that had been deposited as surety in a fraud case has gone missing at the Malindi law courts. The document had been surrendered to the court to secure the release of three suspects who were charged with defrauding the late Mombasa tycoon Tahir Sheikh Said aka TSS Sh28 million. The suspects Zein Ahmed Mohamed, James Mwangi Muturi, and Aweys Ahmed Mohamed were charged with fraud in November last year, but are out on bond. Malindi chief magistrate Julie Oseko charged the three suspects with forging a letter of offer for Kenya Commercial Bank with the signature of the late tycoon. They pleaded not guilty and were released on cash bail of Sh3 million or an alternative bond of Sh4 million with a surety of a similar amount. The suspects reportedly committed the offence at Jane Wanjiru Kogo Advocates on August 25, 2014. Police in Malindi said the matter is being handled by a team of DCI officers from Nairobi. Director of Public Prosecutions officials termed the matter shameful. Aisha Tahir Sheikh, the widow of the tycoon, is the complainant in the case. Click here for the latest political news
