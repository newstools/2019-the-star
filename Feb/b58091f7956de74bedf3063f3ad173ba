Kenya will field junior and youth women’s teams during the inaugural International Handball Federation (IHF) Trophy Zone 5 set for March 10-16 in Zanzibar. Kenya featured in last year’s men’s version of the event in Kampala, Uganda, where the national youth boys team emerged overall winners after seeing off Ethiopia in the final. The junior side finished fourth having fallen to Ethiopia. Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) fixtures secretary Charles Omondi said selection of players is ongoing and national champions Kamusinga Secondary School coach Godfrey Simiyu will be in charge of the teams.  Omondi said: “We are glad to be part of this event and we are keen to send strong teams to the six-day event. We have good players in various schools across the nation and what we are doing is to get them to start training together as a unit.” “Just as the men’s team performed well in Uganda, we hope the women’s sides will not be different.” Meanwhile, National Cereals and Produce Board have a chance to topple champions Nairobi Queens when they battle Yatta Queens tomorrow in the KHF national league. NCPB have 20 points and a win against Yatta Queens tomorrow and Kenyatta University on Sunday will see them top the standing with 24 points—two ahead of Queens who are not in action this weekend. Other matches on cards tomorrow will see Ulinzi Sharks play Yatta Queens in women’s category as champions Black Mamba battle National Youth Service in the men’s. On Sunday, NYS take on St Paul’s University, KU face off with Boomarang, Technical University of Kenya square it off with NCPB as JKUAT cross swords with  Black Mamba in the men’s matches.
