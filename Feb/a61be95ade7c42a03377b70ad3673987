Transport CS James Macharia has appointed six members to the Board of the National Transport and Safety Authority. The appointees are; John Obwocha, Catherine Waweru, Alice Chesire, Francis  Mwongo, Moses Gachemi and Meshak Kidenda. In the Monday gazette notice, Macharia said the officials will serve for a period of three years, with effect from February 4, 2019. On January 21, NTSA was moved to the Interior ministry for easier operations. President Uhuru Kenyatta issued an executive order on the move saying there is a need to foster greater synergies in the development, coordination, application and enforcement of Road Safety. The new changes come only a few days after DCI detectives raided the NTSA headquarters over a probe into possible links the authority's employees had in the Dusit terror attack. Six NTSA officials are in custody for 30 days after the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit last Friday obtained orders to detain them.
