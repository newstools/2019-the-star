The trial of Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria over incitement to violence against ODM leader Raila Odinga started on Tuesday. Kuria is accused of uttering unprintable remarks against Raila and his wife Ida during a political rally at Wangige in Kiambu on September 11, 2017. He is alleged to have made the remarks during campaigns for the repeat presidential election of October 26 in the same year. Chief inspector Kassim Baricha told the court that Kuria's statements had the potential of causing mayhem in the country. He said the DCI treated the issue seriously, prompting Kuria's arrest although no complaint had been lodged against him.

"I invited Kuria to my office for an interview but he insisted he can't say anything in the absence of his lawyer [James Orengo]. He said he was in touch with him, and that is when I booked him at Pangani police station." The detective said the DCI wrote to the Communication Authority over the matter and the video clips were generated. The remarks are alleged to have been aired by various media stations. Detective Alexander Mathenge and an ICT expert attached to the Communication Authority is among the witnesses. Kuria was later locked up at Pangani police station before he was charged.
