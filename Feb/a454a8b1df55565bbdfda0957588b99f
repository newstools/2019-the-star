Three football fans Jackson Gitahi, Nicholas Kirui and Daniel Sumaili received Sh8, 819,633 each for correctly predicting the outcome of all the selected 13 games. After receiving his cheque, Gitahi, a mechanic from Murang’a County, said: “I am happy because my biggest win before this was Sh2,800 from a stake of Sh50. I didn’t give up.” On his part, Sumaili who hails from Tassia, Embakasi and has been jobless for sometime said: “ I was at home in Kitui with my ailing mother when I received the text message. I couldn’t sleep. I started playing on the SportPesa platform when I heard people were winning big and I’m glad we can now sit down with my family and see how to improve our lives. For a 41-year-old Kirui, a tea farmer from Kuresoi, Molo, the win came six months after witnessing Cosmas Korir scoop over Sh208m last year. “He comes from Bomet which is not far from my home. I said to myself, if he could win then it was possible. With this money, I can now construct a house to live in and start farming new crops.”
