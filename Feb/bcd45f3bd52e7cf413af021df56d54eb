World marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge is set to grace the Safaricom Lewa Marathon slated for June 29. Kipchoge, who is the reigning Olympic champion, is the brand ambassador of this year’s event, according to Safaricom director of consumer products, Charles Wanjohi. “Yes, Kipchoge will be there for the event and he is our brand ambassador for Lewa marathon,” he added. In a video link, Kipchoge said he was looking forward to the event. “ I’m looking forward to the Lewa Marathon and the thousands of athletes competing for a worthy cause,” added Kipchoge. Over 1,400 participants are expected for the event for the hugely popular event with registration set to be opened today. “Last year, we opened registration and within four hours, we were closed. I am urging everyone to register as quickly as they can before all the places are filled, ” he added. Wanjohi said the numbers are set at 1,400 due to the huge logistical challenges faced in running in the wild. “It’s a very unique marathon being run in the wild with animals. It’s a big logistical challenge and we must have our numbers low not to interfere with the ecosystem of the area,” noted Wanjohi. The event will feature three race categories this full marathon, half marathon and children’s 5km race. The course is set on dirt roads that take the runners on through the conservancy—across savannah plains, along river banks and through acacia woodland. This will be the 20th edition of the marathon which started in 2000 and Wanjohi said the event has grown in leaps and bounds since inception. “We have come along way since the start 19 years ago and the popularity has grown steadily. It’s getting better with each year,” he added. Over Sh700 million has been raised since inception in 2000.
