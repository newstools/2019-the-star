Northeastern youths have been urged to take up Information Technology and related courses to bridge the shortage in the region. Some problems can easily be solved if the region fully embraces ICT, a senior Education ministry official Mohamed Ibrahim said. Mohamed, who is attached to the National Council for Nomadic Education in Kenya, was addressing an ICT workshop for youth at Garissa University. He said that once the region was IT literate, the physical presence of a teacher in a classroom will not be necessary. “The world is moving towards artificial intelligence and it’s high time we became part of that,” Mohamed told the workshop sponsored by the IBM Digital Nation Africa, the KESHO alliance, PARENiT solution, Global Peace Foundation Kenya and the Education ministry. He said that “education has been affected immensely by lack of teachers who fled because of insecurity. With technology in place, the physical presence of a teacher in a classroom is not necessary.” Umulkheir Harun Mohamed, the founder and director of Kesho Alliance, said northern Kenya has been outsourcing ICT manpower from other counties. Umulkheir, who is taking Applied Computer Technology at the United States International University, urged the youth to stop taking the same courses as doing so was problematic in getting jobs. “We saturate the market when we take the same courses. We have to have young empowered people who are aware of the opportunities in ICT and can be innovative,” she said.
