Household items worth thousands of shillings were destroyed in Garissa town yesterday after a leaking gas cylinder exploded. The incident happened after a househelp lit a burner to prepare tea unaware that gas was leaking. The fire was ignited, and everything in the three-room house went up in smoke. No one was injured. Nothing was saved. The house owners were away. Neighbour Fatuma Ali suspected children could have tampered with the gas cylinder. Garissa firefighters and the public put out the fire. The firemen had difficulty accessing the house as the compound is secured with a perimeter wall and the fire started from the rear. It took them more than five hours to extinguish it. Fatuma urged parents to ensure electric appliances and inflammable materials are secured and children warned to stay away from them. Homeowners were asked to ensure that firefighters and other emergency personnel can easily access their compounds. Mohamed Moulid regretted that there are no access roads to many estates in the town. “The Garissa Planning and Roads departments should ensure all access roads are opened up, otherwise we are staring at a disaster,” he said.
