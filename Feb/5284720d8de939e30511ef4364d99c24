Inefficiencies in national government departments and agencies in counties are caused by lack of funding, Makueni county commissioner Mohammed Maalim (pictured) has said. Unlike the Ministry of Interior, where the government gives quarterly allocations, some county departmental heads get no funding all year round. “I think it’s time all other ministries and government agencies borrow a leaf from the Ministry of Interior and facilitate their officers. How do you expect results from officers with no resources at their disposal?” Maalim said on Monday. He said without funding, officers “cook” reports in the comfort of their offices without making field visits. The commissioner warned county departmental heads against absenteeism. He said all officers are required to adhere to the log-in and log-out registers. “We expect all officers to report to work at 8am and leave at 5pm. I encourage the public to report officers who sneak out of office before time,” Maalim said. Officers seeking to go for long vacations should go in December, he said. Maalim said the national government is committed to services and lazy officers will be fired. The county has mega projects such as Thwake Dam, Konza Techno City and the Kibwezi-Mutomo-Kitui road. He said the projects’ progress is impressing.
