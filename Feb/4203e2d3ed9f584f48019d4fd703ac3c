Ugenya parliamentary seat candidate Kris Karan of ODM has suffered a blow after his two chief campaigners switched allegiance to his rival Dave Ochieng of Movement for Development and Growth party (MDG). Stephen Andwiya and Wiky Kojwang decamped from Karan’s strategic team before joining Ochieng citing high-handedness by the former legislator. Speaking at Jera ward in Ugenya on Saturday, Andwiya said he was forced to make the move after realising that his opinion was being taken for granted. The politician further claimed that ‘selling” Karan to the electorates ahead of the April 5, by-election was equivalent to selling “pork to a Muslim”. “I vigorously campaigned for Karan in the recent elections only to realise that I was shouldering a huge burden that distanced me from the public,” Andwiya said. Kojwang said ODM had lost popularity by fielding an unpopular candidate. He saw the need to join the rival team which he said is progressive and enjoys unwavering support from electorates. He said he would not be cowed in his quest to ensuring that Ochieng wins in the forthcoming by-election with a landslide despite receiving threats from his rivals. Karan during a recent function in Ugenya dismissed the departure of Andwiya f saying it was like a storm in a tea cup. The former legislator added that ODM was still enjoying unwavering support from the electorates saying Andwiya’s move would not tilt any votes. The Ugenya by-election is being said to be two-horse race between Ochieng and Karan.
