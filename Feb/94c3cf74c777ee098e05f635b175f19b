Financially struggling Mumias Sugar Company will resume operations early next week after being shut for close to an year. This is despite shortage of sugarcane. The factory was shut down in April for maintenance and could not reopen due to shortage of cane occasioned by arbitrary poaching by rivals. The company’s board chairman Kennedy Ngumbau said, “We have done some maintenance in the factory and it is ready for crashing. Everything is set for this Sunday. We got some money from selling scrap metals and we used the it for maintenance.” Part of the money from the sale of scrap metals was used to pay salaries pending for months. Ngumbau said other operations will also start. The company also produces Ethanol and electricity through its co-generation project. He said the company had also settled electricity bill. “We have cane in the nucleus estate but it is not enough for the factory. I urge farmers to have confidence in the company and supply their cane to Mumias. We are committed to reviving the company fully,” Ngumbau said. The company’s acting CEO Isaac Sheunda said his focus will be the cane farmers, who are the main stakeholders, by motivating them back into cane farming. He said cane development is also on top on his agenda for the country’s giant sugar miller. “Farmers should be paid first before any other person in the company’s production chain. I will meet all farmers so that we device ways of reviving the company together,” Sheunda said.
