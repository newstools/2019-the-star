A nurse at Amref who went missing last week on Thursday has been found at the Coast General Hospital in ICU. The woman went missing from her home in Nairobi's Tena estate and was found in Mombasa unconscious. Margret Kilelu, who was wearing a black jacket and long grey dress, was found unconscious in a dera at the Mombasa hospital. A dera is a long loose dress associated with the Swahili culture. “She left her house on Thursday around 10 am and we don’t understand how she got to Mombasa. It is said that she was admitted on Saturday but no one can tell us what happened in the two days,” said a family member. "The hospital refused to give the contacts of the good samaritan who took her to the hospital on Saturday." Family and hospital sources told the Star that the woman was admitted on Thursday. The doctors said she has no injuries. The lady was last seen at Amref on Monday last week. "Amref wanted to airlift her to Nairobi but her condition at the moment does not allow. The family and friends now want to bring her to Nairobi using a ground ambulance," said our source. Click here for the latest political news
