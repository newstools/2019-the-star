The decision that students in secondary schools should keep all textbooks issued to them from Form 1-4 is a business deal to enrich publishers, MPs said yesterday. They said this has led to oversupply of books and wastage of resources that could have been directed elsewhere. The ministry has ordered that students proceed to the next class with the textbooks they acquired in the previous class and will be allocated new books for their new classes. They will return all books on completion of Form 4. But Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang yesterday defended the decision, saying it will ensure equity among students and will end the heavy burden of the cost to parents. Kipsang said the ministry wants to ensure a level playing ground among students as most day schools are understaffed, heavily populated and encounter problems in completing the syllabus. “It has taken the country more than 50 years to appreciate the correlation between availability of instructional materials and the learning outcomes,” the PS said. Kipsang said most students are day scholars. They don’t go to school at the weekend and it is important they get textbooks to be at par with those in boarding schools. Ministry of Education statistics show that 72 per cent of learners are day scholars. The rest are in boarding schools. The ministry says the decision on textbooks was reached after a meeting last November with secondary school principals. “If enriching a few people entails creating equal opportunities for our learners, so be it. Students in most schools are still struggling with inadequately coverage of the syllabus and even those that have completed the syllabus, the books will come in handy during revision,” Kipsang told the Parliament Committee on Education yesterday. He dismissed fears of oversupply of books as the ministry relies on data sent by school heads in procurement of the textbooks.
