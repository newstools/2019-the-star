Three
years after breaking up with gospel singer Hey Z, Mercy has come out to
disclose that her seven-year relationship with him drove her to
contemplate suicide. "I kept thinking he will change. That it will get better. I mean we have a child," she told Ebru TV. "Plus,
where am I going? What will people say? Oh my God, I will be judged. So
I kept going back and it just got worse and when I say worse, I mean it
was really really bad, to a point that I got suicidal." She says her now husband, Bobb, is a very supportive man."If you are in an unhappy space, leave!" she advised. Bobb is a creative producer alongside his partners, Phillip Karanja and Abel Mutua, at Phil It Productions.
