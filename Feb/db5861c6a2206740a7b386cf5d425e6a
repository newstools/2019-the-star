Police surveillance has been intensified on the Migori-Narok border after a land dispute between two communities. Arsonists set ablaze a home in Kilgoris, Narok, on Wednesday. Ghati Mugendi lost three huts, farm produce and household items. “I have lost everything. This is less than a year after my husband died in a similar attack,” a tearful Mugendi said. She was away when the huts were torched. Kilgoris police boss David Wambua said on Monday that the arson was due to a land dispute between the Kurias and the Kipsigis. “We are aware of the attack,” Wambua said police officers are on the ground and the situation is under control. “There is no tension at all. The situation is calm,” he said. The Kurias said they feared being attacked. They claimed the Kipsigis wanted them to leave and claim their land. “We fear we may be attacked anytime. We do not know where to run as this is the only home we know,” Sigore Weibe said. The Kurias claim they bought the land and it belongs to them.
