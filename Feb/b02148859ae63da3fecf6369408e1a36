A doctor has absolved The Nairobi Hospital of blame in the botched breast enlargement surgery which led to a woman’s death, saying she was in already critical condition when she was brought to the facility. In an affidavit filed in a suit yesterday, the medical director of Nairobi Hospital, Christopher Abeid, said the surgery that led to June Wanza Mulupi’s complications was done at a different facility. He pointed an accusing finger at colleague Stanley Khainga for allowing a medical officer to handle the patient’s file. He said Khainga was the patient’s primary doctor and he( Abeid) was only being informed of what was happening in the procedure that happened in his absence. He blamed the doctor for allowing the medical officer to handle the patient and document her file at the facility, saying he was unqualified. “The second petitioner (Martin Ajujo) is not a qualified plastic surgeon and it was unacceptable for the first petitioner (Khainga), who had primary care over the patient, to allow him to review the patient and document her file,” Abeid said. On June 6, 2018, Mulupi was referred to Nairobi Hospital by Surgeoderm Healthcare Clinic where she had undergone breast augmentation and liposuction. She had multiple dressings on bilaterial iliac areas which were soaked in blood, the hospital noted. After they discovered she was in bad shape she was moved to high dependency unit and after review she was moved to intensive care unit for dialysis, noting that she was going into cardiac failure. Abeid’s affidavit was filed in response to a case filed by the doctors. The case will be mentioned on April 16.
