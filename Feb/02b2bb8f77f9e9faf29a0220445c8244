Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti has urged elected leaders and residents to unite for development. The Supreme Court upheld his reelection two weeks ago. Awiti’s August 8, 2017, General Election victory was challenged by former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga. Awiti has also been out of the county for about six months due to illness. He returned to his office on Friday and extended an olive branch to Magwanga, urging him to help him shape up the county.. The protracted court battle, Awiti said, has hurt development for more than one and half years. He said there is no time to waste now that the case is behind them. “We want to recover the lost time to ensure Homa Bay residents get what they deserve. People have complained that we are slow in development,” the governor said. The county government has been described as moribund in services, accused of corruption and still faces court cases among its officials. Awiti said he holds no grudge against Magwanga and other opponents and he is ready to work with everyone to make a difference in six months. “The court case which deprived Homa Bay of the much-needed development is now behind us. We must dedicate all our efforts to the realisation of the growth agenda as expected by residents,” he said. Awiti said his administration is focused on services. Some of the projects in the pipeline are construction of Homa Bay town market, water supply, roads and improvement of agriculture. The governor was accompanied by Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata. Orata said the victory at the Supreme Court is for all residents. “Nobody was defeated or won since we all belong to Homa Bay,” he said. Magwanga has accepted the apex court’s verdict but urged Awiti to focus on his development pledges. “The Homa Bay government should embark on development and implement projects to benefit residents,” he said.
