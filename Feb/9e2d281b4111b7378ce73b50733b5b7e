His administration has not done much development but Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama has said he is determined to make a difference. “...the time to ensure
development is now and that is what I promise the residents to have in mind,” he
said in Nyamira town on Tuesday. Nyagarama was addressing residents, MCAs and Treasury officials during a meeting at a hotel in Nyamira town. They had gathered to discuss the county's expenditure. The governor defended himself after residents and MCAs raised concerns over the lack of development projects. Nyamira has for some time been listed among counties lagging
behind in development and mismanagement of funds from the national
government. In his 2016-17 report, the Auditor General highlights massive misuse of and loss of funds. Early this year he indicated that a number of projects had stalled, despite being allocated funds. The 2016-17 report showed that locally generated revenue had declined by Sh27.2 million from 2014-15. One reason for this, it noted, could be failure to automate. The report stated that under-performance in revenue collection
points to leakages or unrealistic revenue targets. The officers from Treasury were Bonface Nderitu, Alice Ngang'a and Samuel Towet. The officers said there is need for the county government to ensure resources from the national government are used wisely to enhance development. Nyagarama is serving his last term. Leaders have complained over the lack of development. “Mismanagement of resources, corruption and poor performance are among the key factors that have led to [us lagging] behind in development. We need these executives out so we can have
competent individuals [who are] ready to work,” nominated MCA Fredrick Mosiori said on Tuesday.
