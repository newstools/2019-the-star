Swimming ace Samuel Ndonga is eyeing to bring down two national records in the upcoming national trials in April. Ndonga is angling to lower Micah Fernandes’ national records in 50m and 100m breaststroke long course set at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. Fernandes’ records stand at 30.08 (50m) and 1:07.09 (100m) respectively. “There will be a lot of training that will go into this quest. My coach and I have to do more in both gym-work and swim. Even though my coach was away on national duty, I noted (and I’ll share with her) areas where I need to work on ahead of the trials,” said Ndonga who swept gold medals in the three breaststroke events during the national long course championships last weekend. Having timed 31.23 in 50m, clocked 1:10.82 in the 100m, posted 2:42.45 in the 200m and 25.48 in 50m freestyle (16 and over category) at the long course championships, the Otters Swim Club athlete acknowledges that he his work is already cut out. “It is not easy to demolish records, and especially in swimming. I know it might be agonizing but I am determined to hit my goal. There will be a huge balancing act between my training regime and my course work but I trust I can manage,” added the final year business and entrepreneurship undergraduate student at Edulink International College. Apart from breaking the records, Ndonga is also eyeing to make the Kenya team to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics during the April trials. “I am aiming to make the 2020 Tokyo Olympic team, and with Kenya swimmers based abroad coming to compete, my work is already cut out. The number of Kenya-based swimmers is Shrinking so I have to work hard to set an example to the upcoming generation that one can train in Kenya and make it to the Olympics,” continued Ndonga after observing that recently, most Kenyan swimming Olympians were based abroad. Meanwhile, Breaburn School’s Dale Mwangi who finished third (to Ndonga and Breaburn Arusha’s Ciaran Eddy) in both 100m and 200m breaststroke is keen to post a sub 2:30.0 in the latter distance. After posting 2:44.39 at the championships, Mwangi chooses to work with his personal best time of 2:38.00 clocked last October to achieve his goal. “Mine is already cut out. I have to do lots of gym work to get the power and high intensity (sprints and technique) swimming to achieve this,” said the swimmer who is coached by Doyle Finch.
