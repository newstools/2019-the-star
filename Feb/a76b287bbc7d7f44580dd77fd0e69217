Some time ago, while driving on a rough track in the Athi Basin, I noticed a large, predominantly green worm with beautiful markings on an acacia tree branch. After stopping and looking properly, we noted that it was the worm that eventually becomes an emperor moth. Then I thought, wow! Isn’t this an amazing part of creation? Eggs hatch and tiny worms emerge and then consume large quantities of leaves to grow into massive worms. The worms then make silky coloured cocoons, and after a short period of time, they change completely as they wiggle out their cocoons as flying creatures we call moths and butterflies. What an incredible metamorphosis to change from wiggly fat worms into magnificent winged wonders. Interestingly, there are many people who believe that humans are similar to greedy fat worms. Take… take… take, until we find the true purpose God has given us on Earth and discover who we are, then hopefully over a period of time, many people are transformed to use their gifts and talents for good purpose to make this world a better place for all to live together. Worms and butterflies are also a vital part of many ecosystems. Many birds and creatures feast on worms to survive. Butterflies land on flowers to suck delicious nectar through their proboscis, and accidentally gather pollen on their bodies as they rub against the anthers. The butterflies then rub some of the pollen on the next flowers they move to and then collect some more. Through this process, the butterflies are able to pollinate numerous flowers as they move along. Pollination allows plants to reproduce by producing seeds. The natural transformation of worms changing into winged wonders is an incredible part of what God has created.
