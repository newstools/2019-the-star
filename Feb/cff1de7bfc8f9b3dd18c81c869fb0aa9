Singer Size 8 has defended herself for supporting gospel artistes Hopekid and DK Kwenye Beat who have been accused of sexually exploiting a 20-year-old college student and allegedly infecting her with an STI. "The main reason I got involved in this story is because they are children of God and they also need to be loved," Size 8 told Word Is on Friday. Hours later she withdrew her support for the gospel artistes implicated in the salacious scandal. She released a statement that read in part: “I unequivocally reject his actions, and those by any person, that in any way inhibit the rights or safety of another human being. I further reached out to the lady in the story. We pray that justice may prevail and that the girl in the story shall get a full and comprehensive recovery, of both mind and body.” Instagram users asked Size 8 why she was only pushing for the artistes to be forgiven, yet there was a lady in the mix, who was sexually exploited. "At the time, I had not talked to her but later I talked to the lady and she said she is now feeling better. She will be opening a counseling centre where she will be talking to people about such matters affecting women in the society," the singer told Word Is.
