Newly elected Impala chairman Bob Asiyo believes the club can qualify for the Kenya Cup play-offs despite a poor run of form in recent weeks. Asiyo, who was elected unopposed over the weekend, said the short term goal for the new executive committee will be to ensure the former champions qualify for the season ending playoffs in April. He takes over from former Kenya Sevens coach Bill Githinji and will serve for one year. The Sarries have lost four matches consecutively including 41-10 to Kabras, 22-20 to Nondies 20-16 to Mwamba and 37-24 to Quins in the Ngong Road derby a fortnight ago. The club are seventh on the log with 20 points and face a stern test against Menengai Oilers on Saturday at the Nakuru show ground. Asiyo said they will take one game at a time as they seek to move up the table. “Our form has been poor of late but we have eight games remaining to see if we can cover ground and finish our season strongly if not win the title,” said Asiyo. Sources close to the team indicate that there has been player mutiny against certain management officials in the past two seasons but Asiyo said the new committee has taken note. “We are having our first meeting as the new committee later in the week and the issues raised by the players will also be addressed,” he promised.
