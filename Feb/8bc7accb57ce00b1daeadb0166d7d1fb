Police in Kwale are holding 14 youths suspected to belong to criminal gangs. County police commander Tom Odero yesterday said the group was arrested following a clash between youths from Likoni (Mombasa) and Waa (Kwale). They clashed at 4.30pm on Saturday at Waa Bweka borehole in Matuga. Police recovered crude weapons.“Three men from Likoni came to fetch water from the borehole but they met resistance. The Likoni team got agitated, called for reinforcements and a clash ensued,” Odero said. Police arrested the 14 youths from either side. “Most of them are teenagers and we believe they are members of criminal gangs. Some suffered injuries and were treated and discharged,” Odero said. The group was to appear in court yesterday. “We are pursuing others who may have escaped and we assure the public of security,” he said. Plans to set up a police post at Ng’ombeni are underway. Some gang members reportedly hide there. Some Sh2 million has been set aside by the Matuga CDF for the police post. A land has been identified. However, some Ng’ombeni residents oppose the idea. They say police will beat their children instead of enforcing security. But Odero told residents the police post is for their own good.
