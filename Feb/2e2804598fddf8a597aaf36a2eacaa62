Water taps will be dry in Guba, Wathorego, Alango, Gita, Ongadi, Mamboleo, Chiga and Migosi because of low levels at the Kajulu treatment plant. Kisumu Water and Sewerage Company on Friday said the long dry spell and reduced water volumes in River Kibos will also affect supply to National Housing Cooperation, Uzima University, Riat and Otonglo estates. Managing director Thomas Odongo said some of the commodity will be sourced from the Dunga water treatment plant. “More water is being pumped from the Dunga plant to Kibuye reservoirs for distribution to our customers,” Odongo said. Areas served by Kibuye reservoirs will receive normal services.
