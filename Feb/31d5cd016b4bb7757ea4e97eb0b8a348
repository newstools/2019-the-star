Mandera residents and their leaders yesterday said they will not support the scrapping or merger of counties. They spoke when the Building Bridges Initiative team was collecting their views. The team was in county on Tuesday and yesterday. Elder Mohamed Gasey said devolution is the best thing that has happened in Kenya for decades. He said they have been “hearing stories of merging counties and scrapping of others”. If there is such a proposal, Gasey said, residents of Mandera will oppose it. “From where we sit, devolution was a godsend. It’s the wearer of the shoe who knows where it pinches,” he said. Gasey said devolution has transformed the region after it had been marginalised for a long time. Halima Ahmed from Lafey said the government should increase resource allocation to counties. According to Halima, the current allocation ( 15 per cent of national budget) is little and cannot do much to improve people’s lives. “Infrastructure, health and water services have greatly improved. We believe a lot more will be achieved if the allocation is increased,” she said. Governor Ali Roba and Senator Mohamud Mohamed said the region does not support the reduction of counties or creation of more positions. They said the government should increase the Equalisation Fund to fast-track growth in underdeveloped counties. The leaders said northern Kenya has been marginalised by successive post-independent governments and it is time their counties are given priority to boost development. views from 13 counties BBI task force vice -chairman Adams Oloo said their agenda is not to amend the Constitution. Oloo said most of the views collected in the 13 counties the committee has visited are on amending the Constitution. The task force was formed after the March 9 ( 2018 ) handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga.
