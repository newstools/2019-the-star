Safaricom has entered the parking payments business following a partnership with Kenya Airports Parking Services. The firm is widening its revenue streams by riding on and consolidating the use of its M-Pesa platform which currently has more than 21 million users. In the partnership, KAPS has brought on board Safaricom to integrate its payment system with M-Pesa in its more than 60 stations across the country. KAPS has also expressed interest in taking over the collection of Nairobi County government parking fees three days after Jambo Pay announced its intention to exit City Hall. “We are looking forward to the opportunity...one of our main strengths is ticketing and we want to offer the service not just in the malls but also on-street,” KAPS CEO Bonnyventure Saronge said yesterday. Officials from Jambo Pay cited the reasons for not renewing the contract as political interference and intimidation. The e-payment service provider was contracted by ex-Nairobi governor Evans Kidero in 2014 to automate and improve revenue collection in the City. It’s contract expires on April 7, 2019. Last Saturday, City Hall published a tender notice seeking a private firm to install an integrated city revenue management system (ICMS). At the same time, Safaricom has said that it will work with whoever wins the tender. “We are a service payments provider and whoever wins the tender, we will work with them to provide a payment solution,” Safaricom chief financial services officer Sitoyo Lopokoiyoit said. He further hinted on cashing in on the more than 10,000 cars that pass through the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on a daily basis. Currently, KAPS manages parking at various airports in the country, shopping malls, and some major hospitals. For a start, KAPS CEO said the new Lipa Parking na Mpesa integrated into their system will be used in at least 50 locations inclusive of malls and hospitals.
