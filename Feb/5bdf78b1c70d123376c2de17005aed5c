Kengen yesterday ended a two-year streak of non payment of dividends to its shareholders after paying 40 cents in earnings per share to its members. The company paid Sh2.4 billion by cheque and M-Pesa to its individual shareholders, who hold a 30 per cent stake. The government is the majority shareholder, with 70 per cent of stake in the energy producer while some 190,716 Kenyans hold the remaining shares. The payment, a payout out of 33 per cent on its net earnings, is the highest yet in the company’s history; pointing to improved yields on the company’s counter at the Nairobi Securities Exchange. KenGen’s financial performance has exhibited stable growth with revenue having grown three-fold from Sh12 billion in 2010 to Sh36 billion in 2018. The  largest geothermal energy producer in Africa, is ranked ninth globally with the completion of the Olkaria V geothermal power plant in July this year set to raise that ranking even further.
