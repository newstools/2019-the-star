Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji wants technology used in the investigation and prosecution of corruption-related cases for a speedy conclusion. In a statement on Saturday, he welcomed Chief Justice David Maraga and judges' resolve to expedite hearingÂ graft cases. Haji appreciated the Judiciary for acknowledging the challenges the directorate experiences while building a formidable case. ".. we commend the Judiciary for acknowledging some of the challenges faced by the prosecutorial arm, such as the provision of witness statements which often run into thousands of pages in anti-corruption cases," the statement read in part. The DPP said his office will invest in technology to make the work easier and timely. "....the DPP shall strongly advocate for the use of technology in the investigation, prosecution, and adjudication [of the cases] without compromising the right to a fair trial," he said. Maraga met judicial officials on Friday to discuss the pressure on the Judiciary regarding it being perceived as a weak link in the fight against corruption. The CJ met the president of the Court of Appeal, the principal judge of the High Court, the presiding judge in the Employment and Labour Relations Court, and all presiding judges of superior courts in the country. The officials also discussed how to clear the case backlogs and how to have judges and magistrates actively manage cases they handle. The DPP emphasised the need to have the justice sector players to "collaboratively approach the fight against corruption" to ensure the result is in the best interest of the citizens.
