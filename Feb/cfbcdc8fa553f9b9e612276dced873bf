Kenya African National Union Party has expressed its concern over the disappearance of its national Youth Congress Chairman Billian Ojiwa. Ojiwa was reported missing from Sunday evening and attempts to reach him through his mobile phone have been unsuccessful. The party has urged its supporters to turn up at Kilimani Police Station on Tuesday morning in solidarity with the missing Kanu official. According to his wife, Nerima Wako, the CEO of Siasa Place, Ojiwa was last seen wearing a beige jacket, black button-up shirt and maroon trousers. “He has been missing for 44 hours. This is difficult and sometimes I have no words, but thank you for the prayers, support and good will,” she said. Kenyans have shown their solidarity with the family and friends of the Kanu official on twitter through the hashtag  #FindBillianOjiwa Ojiwa's disappearance comes barely a week after Caroline Mwatha, a human rights activist based in Dandora went missing. She had been documenting cases of enforced disappearance and police extrajudicial killings, including the cold blood murder of six Dandora residents in October last year.
