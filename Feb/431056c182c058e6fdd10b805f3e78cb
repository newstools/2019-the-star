Young MPs want DPP Noordin Haji to ensure all corruption cases are prosecuted effectively to ensure maximum convictions. Led by Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja, the legislators under Kenya Youth Parliamentarians Association (KYPA) challenged Haji to also ensure that stolen public funds are recovered. He said massive corruption had deprived youths employment opportunities. Sakaja also asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to ensure youths get their share in state appointments "The Constitution is clear that youth is someone between the age of 18 and 35 years. It is unfortunate that during governments appointments the youths are normally left out," he said. Sakaja spoke on Tuesday during a media briefing for the young parliamentarians in Nairobi. The MPs further asked the government to take seriously the input of youths in the Building Bridges Initiative. "Getting a job for the young people should not be dependent on someone's personal relationship. The youths have a right to get jobs and this is not a favour but government's obligation," he said.

"The amount of money being channelled to those positions can instead go back to the government and help the youth and other sectors where the money can be put into good use," she said. Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro in his remarks said the fine for corruption should be moved to at least one million to discourage those with intentions to benefit from proceeds of corruption. Nyoro said the jail term should also change to at least ten years of imprisonment. Click here for the latest political news
