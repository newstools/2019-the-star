An MCA has asked Governor Mike Sonko to cancel an insurance cover for City Hall staff and use the fund to improve services in public hospitals. Mlango Kubwa MCA Patriciah Mutheu on Tuesday said the AAR Kenya cover was too expensive yet the firm offers “poor services.” City Hall contracted the private health insurer in a deal worth over Sh1 billion. “It is absurd that the executive agreed to pay a lot of funds to private firms which charge high rates for services,” Mutheu said. She gave a notice of motion to compel Sonko to cancel the deal and instead channel the funds to building capacity in county hospitals. “The money can be used to buy drugs for dispensaries and hire more nurses,” Mutheu said. Mutheu, who is the chairperson of the Ward Development Fund, said it was wrong to enter the deal when health services were still poor. The AAR cover has come under serious scrutiny since the deal was signed with former Governor Evans Kidero’s administration in 2016. The firm earns between Sh1.06 billion and Sh1.3 billion annually in the deal. On Sunday, clinical officers said the deal should be cancelled and the contract awarded to the National Hospital Insurance Fund. “Makueni was able to equip a level 4 hospital with just Sh140 million. We can do a lot with the Sh1.2 billion,” Mutheu said. She said investing the funds in public hospitals will bring down the cost of services for residents. She said Nairobi hospitals were battling serious inefficiencies which can be addressed by the funds. “Our health facilities are reeling from congestion of patients, lack of medicine and essential equipment and frequent strikes by medical staff,” she said. The MCA said NHIF was a better alternative with a revamped health cover for all employees. “NHIF is relatively cheaper and will allow the county to cut costs and direct excess funds to proper use in the health sector.”
