Applications by graduates to become assistant chiefs in Malava have been rejected because they are “overqualified” The provincial administration is seeking to fill the position for Lunyinya sublocation. The vacancy attracted tens of applications, including those degree holders and those with superior qualifications. Samuel Injendi said he received a regret message informing him he was overqualified. Amos Shamala, the subcounty human resource officer said applicants with degree certificates were overqualified. “The advertisement dated December 31 was very clear about qualifications and degree was not one of them,” Shamala said. Residents have accused the official of plotting to have his preferred candidate given the job. Nancy Barasa said Shamala was deliberately confusing shortlisted candidates on the date of interviews. Twenty-six candidates from Lunyinya and Mwera have been shortlisted for the interviews scheduled for today and tomorrow. “Others have received misleading messages about the date, time and venue or no communication at all,” Barasa said. She is among those shortlisted. Shamala admitted some messages had errors “because they were sent without editing.” “Names of three successful candidates will be forwarded to the Principal Secretary in Nairobi who is the appointing authority,” Shamala said. “Our deputy county commissioner Patrick Messo and I have nothing to do with hiring the assistant chief.” He said letters inviting those shortlisted for the interviews were delayed because Messo had not signed them. Residents want the process annulled and Shamala investigated. “I have not received official communication concerning the date for interviews yet I’m one of the panelist. This process is suspect,” Levi Ondeyo said. He asked Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to intervene and stop juniors officers from imposing officials on residents.
