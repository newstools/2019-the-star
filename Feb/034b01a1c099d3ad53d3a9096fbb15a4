Controversial artiste Akothee 'Madam Boss' on Saturday introduced her parents to fans during the Valentine's beach party in Watamu. Sporting a white, short dress, she thrilled fans for nearly two hours in front of her parents Joshua Kokeyo, a former district officer, and Monica Yunita. “Many of you know me for doing lots of dirty things, but I would like to show you my parents who are here with me," she said. Akothee told fans that even though many know her for her ‘crazy behaviors’, she was proud to have been brought up by "rich parents". Her mother said Akothee was a third born in the family from Migori, and inherited her music talent from her father.
