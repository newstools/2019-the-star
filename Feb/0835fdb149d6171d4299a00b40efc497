Kenya Sevens’ winger William Reeves has been ruled out of the Las Vegas and Vancouver legs slated for next month with a knee injury Reeves picked the injury during the Hamilton leg and did not play at the Sydney tournament. He is expected to recover and be ready for the Asian leg in Singapore and Hong Kong in April. Head coach Paul Murunga said Homeboyz trio Cyprian Kuto, Bush Mwale and Mark Wandetto had minor knocks but should be fine for the trip to Vegas next month. “They picked a couple of minor knocks but with a bit of rest and recovery, they will be okay,” added Murunga. Murunga cited fatigue as the reason for the poor performance in Sydney, where Shujaa lost all five matches. “The boys were mentally and emotionally drained from Hamiliton and if you factor in the long flights, most of them are not used to it,” added Murunga. Kenya lost 24-14 to Canada, 41-0 to USA, 40-17 to France, 19-14 to Wales and 20-17 to non core side Tonga. Murunga said he has faith in the young charges and they will come good in the next leg in North America. “The team is learning and adapting very fast. The tournament in Sydney was setback and we will go back to the drawing board to see how we can improve in the next two tournaments,” added Murunga. Murunga said the kickoffs and defensive alignments are the two things the side will focus on once they resume training next week. “We have work to do on kick-off reception and our defensive shape and ensure we don’t concede so many point,” quipped Murunga. Murunga was non-committal on the senior players being available for the reminder of the World Sevens Series. “It’s up to the union and senior players to decide. As for me, I will pick players who are training,” added Murunga. On the pool in Vegas where Kenya face USA, Argentina and France, he termed the pooling tricky. “It’s a pool which can go either way. All the four teams there are competitive and we want to qualify for the main cup quarters.”
