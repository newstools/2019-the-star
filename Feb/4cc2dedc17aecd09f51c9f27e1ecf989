Here are the other stories making headlines in the Star this morning. How fake "Uhuru" conned Merali firm Sh 80 million They drive new luxury cars, wear designer suits costing several thousand dollars and live in palatial homes in high-end neighbourhoods. They ooze money and influence. They're well-connected in the corridors of power and have the composure and audacity to mimic President Uhuru Kenyatta's voice as they con gullible greedy people of millions of shillings. Seven people arrested by the DCI over the weekend have been running an elaborate tender scam in which several unsuspecting Kenyans lost buckets of money. _____________________________________________________ DCI summons big names in Sh90 billion dam probe Influential politicians and directors of top firms are among powerful individuals summoned by anti-graft detectives for questioning today over the stalled Sh63 billion dam projects. Three Cabinet Secretaries including Treasury’s Henry Rotich have already recorded statements over the issue. Today, DCI boss George Kinoti has summoned 107 firms and hundreds of their directors in an unprecedented move to tame “tenderpreneurship” seen as the biggest platform for sleaze. _____________________________________________________ Haji says Iranian envoy bribes Kenyans to aid terror convicts An Iranian diplomat offered a Sh150 million bribe to three Kenyans to facilitate the escape of two Iranian convicts. The Director of Public Prosecutions yesterday accused the senior diplomat at the Iranian Embassy of colluding with lawyer Robin Nyangaresi and Wesley Kiptanui and Shemgrant Agyei for an escape plan.

Children in such cases use section 26 of Mental Health Act, which allows the court to make orders for the management of persons suffering from mental disorders. The law allows the guardian to also take care of the well-being of the person with a mental disorder. To solve the trouble that comes with seeking guardianship order, there is a deliberate move towards writing what is called a living will. _____________________________________________________ Liquor maker’s accounts frozen over tax evasion Tycoon Humphrey Kariuki has suffered a major setback after the High Court yesterday froze three of his company’s bank accounts. Anti-corruption judge John Onyiego preserved the funds of Africa Spirits Limited, WOW Beverages and Wines of World Limited and directed the Kenya Revenue Authority to serve the companies with the court documents within three days.
