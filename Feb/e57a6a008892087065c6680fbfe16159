Keroka Athletics Training Club’s  Daniel Kayiok braved strong opposition to win the hotly contested 10km senior men’s race during the Kisii cross country championship at Tendere secondary yesterday. Kayiok ran behind race favourites Japan-based Josephat Ladema and Bernard Musonik before breaking away to win the race in 28:30.39. Ladema settled for the second place in 28:58.00 while Musonik came third in 29:18.22. “I decided to run behind them because I knew my finishing kick is strong. After 8kms, I decided to shake them off and go. I’m now focussing on the regionals next week,” said Kayiok. Ladema, however, said he arrived on Sunday from Japan and has not trained properly. “I will train for the next one week ahead of the regionals. My aim is to make it to nationals first,” said the student at Obirin University in Japan. Lenkai Olenkai (30:00.17) came fourth with Dennis Koech  fifth in 30:33.00 and Joseph Onsarigo sixth in 31:00.00. In the junior men’s 8km race, Japan-based Benuel Mogeni clocked 24:31.9 to win the race. He ran a tactical race, beating Francis Charito and Joel Moturi of St Peter’s Keberesi in the last two kilometres. Charito clocked 24:30.05 and Moturi 24:56.00. Felix Kaptui clocked 25:33.06 to finish fourth while Edwin Kennedy of Mogonga High finishing fifth in 35:37.04. “I can’t complain about the course because it was flat but the weather was a bit hot. I have been training in Kisii since I arrived in December,” said Mogeni, a student at Oltei Tomei High school in Japan.
