Kenya has been ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world according to a report by Transparency International. The report called Corruption Perception Index 2018 ranked countries on a scale of zero (most corrupt) to 100 (very clean). “Kenya scored a 27 which is below the average world score of 43 but an improvement from last year where our score was 26,”said Bernadette Musindi. In the list of 180 countries of the world, Kenya ranked at position 144 tying the spot with Nigeria which had a similar index score. Musindi who is the chair Transparency International stated that even though the progress was minimal, it meant the country was headed in the right direction. “Perhaps the most disturbing fact is that the vast majority of countries assessed have made little to no progress. Only 20 out of 180 countries have made significant progress in recent years,” the report read. Kenya has been marred by corruption cases including the latest National Youth Service scandal that saw five top commercial banks plead guilty to playing roles in the theft and loss of public resources.
