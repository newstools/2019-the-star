Lenny Kivuti given a state job after he lost the election petition he had filed against Governor Martin Wambora. Ruguru/Ngandori MCA Muturi Mwombo (above) yesterday said giving Kivuti a job will “heal” Embu county. The Supreme Court upheld Wambora’s victory on January 30. Mwombo said Kivuti and his supporters were bitter after the loss. He said the bitterness will cause tension and there is a need for all stakeholders and Wambora to heal the county. To hasten the healing process, President Uhuru Kenyatta should appoint Kivuti to a senior government position, the MCA said. He said this will calm Kivuti and his supporters and the county will be united again. “Healing does not take one day and it’s a process and if this is done, it will enable us move on as a county.” The ward representative, who is the County Assembly health committee chairman, congratulated Wambora for retaining the seat and urged him to extend an olive branch to Kivuti so they can work together. He urged Kivuti to accept defeat and join Wambora in developing Embu. Mwombo urged other ward reps to support Wambora and accord him space to work. He asked them, however, not to abdicate their oversight role over the executive.
