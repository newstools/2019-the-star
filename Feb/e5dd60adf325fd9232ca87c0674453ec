An Australian national was on Friday arrested by detectives for covering and switching off CCTV cameras at an apartment in Nairobi. Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti said the man is a resident at the apartment. He gave the name of the man as Benjamin Gsull. "Police had earlier received complaints of attempted housebreaking and were carrying out investigations when they discovered him in the footage," Kinoti said in a tweet. He did not give the location of the apartment. The man was found in possession of bhang and ammunition after a search was conducted in his house, Kinoti said. "He is currently in safe custody and will be charged with being in possession of ammunition without a firearm certificate among other offences," he said. The arrest came hours after another man was arrested in Mukuru in Pipeline after he was spotted with a gun. The man was photographed with a gun protruding from his waistband as he collected garbage. Kenyans on Twitter brought the matter to the attention of the DCI who moved in and arrested him. There has been heightened surveillance in the city following the January 15 terror attack at DusitD2 complex and an IED explosion at the Latema Road-Tom Mboya intersection. Police have since released CCTV footage seeking the public's help in identifying a man believed to have been responsible for the January 27 explosion. In the footage, a man of Somali descent is seen walking casually on the sidewalks carrying a small carton box. Detectives believe the luggage is what went off moments later after he left it in the custody of a trolley pusher. Two people were injured in the incident.
