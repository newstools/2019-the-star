Rongai residents on Friday confronted an AP officer whom they accused of soliciting a bribe from a matatu tout. They confronted the policeman after he kicked the tout for refusing to give him a Sh2,000 bribe. Locals said the officer attached to Tumaini AP camp has been extorting money from matatu operators who ply the Rongai-Bomas route. "This officer has been taking bribes from us daily and we have decided enough is enough," Simon Sitet, a tout, said. He claimed the officer became aggressive when they refused to give in to his demands. The officer's colleagues came to his rescue. The officers arrested the tout and his colleagues and took them to Ongata Rongai police station. Residents have asked Interior CS Fred Matiang'i to rein in the officers. In March last year, an EACC survey found the Interior ministry to be the most corrupt.
