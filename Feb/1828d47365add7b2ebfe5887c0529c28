Governor Ferdinand Waititu claims that the strike by nurses has forced patients from other counties to seek treatment in the county. As a result, Kiambu nurses are overworked and medicines are fast being depleted. Waititu said his government will employ more doctors, clinicians and nurses. The governor spoke yesterday in Kiambu after signing a return-to-work formula with the Kenya National Union of Nurses, Kiambu chapter. This resulted in the calling off of the work boycott slated for today. “We have our hospitals loaded with patients which means we are offering better services and we can not chase patients away. We sat down with our nurses and found an amicable solution to their demands and they will not strike as earlier indicated,” Waititu said. He said the county had set aside Sh30 million for nurses’ salaries and only waited for approval from the Salaries Remuneration Commission. “We will pay Sh3,000 in addition to the basic salaries this financial year, then Sh3,500 in the next financial year until we honour the agreement that was laid down through the council of governors,” the governor said.
