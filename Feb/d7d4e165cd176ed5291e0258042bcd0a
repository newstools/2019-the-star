The Judiciary was under fire yesterday over Sh310 million palatial Runda residence lying idle almost five years since its acquisition. The house has been subject of protracted legal battles. It was acquired in 2013 as the official residence of the Chief Justice. Chief Registrar of the Judiciary Anne Amadi yesterday surprised lawmakers when she said the facility on the upscale Runda estate was not in a habitable state and is currently lying idle even after all cases had been withdrawn. She appeared before the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee over the 2019-20 Budget Policy statement. The committee is chaired by William Cheptumo (Baringo North). MPs, led by Jenniffer Shamala (nominated) pushed the registrar to explain why the house is not used. “We spent money to buy a house in Runda and up to now nobody is occupying the house,” she said. Amadi said the last case on the facility was withdrawn last year, but the house requires “some work to be done” before it is occupied. She said the current war on corruption will be greatly hampered by the budget shortfall and urged the Treasury to consider more funding to the institution. The Judiciary requested for Sh6.2 billion for the next financial year, but the Treasury only approved Sh3.8 billion. Hiring of more judges, construction of new courts, completion of new ones, and automation of judicial services are some of the activities she said are likely to suffer if government does not allocate more funds. “For us to fast-track corruption cases, we need to increase the number of magistrates which we cannot do now,” Amadi said. “Kenyans will continue to walk for long distances to get to courts because with the budget cut, we cannot build new courts in the new financial year.” Click here for the latest political news
