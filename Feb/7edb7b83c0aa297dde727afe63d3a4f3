National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale has clashed with Deputy President William Ruto over his (DP’s) proposal to strengthen the Senate. The Garissa Township MP said framers of the Constitution did not contemplate a powerful and superior Senate that could control the National Assembly. Duale insisted that if there is any push to alter the roles of the Senate, it should be taken to a referendum for Kenyans to decide. “You cannot change the rules midway. If you want to deal with the Senate, let us put it among the questions in the referendum.” He spoke during a debate on the County Government (Amendment) Bill. Duale has vehemently defended the Assembly’s more powerful role and often warned the Senate against encroaching into the 349-member House’s turf. He has accused senators of failing in their role to defend and protect devolution. Ruto, while giving a lecture at Chatham House two weeks ago, proposed that Senate be given extra roles to distinguish it from the Assembly. He proposed its elevation to an Upper House, similar to the model in the United States. Click here for the latest political news
