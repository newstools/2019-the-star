President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday issued a directive for the creation of a single system of revenue collection to eliminate duplications and wastage of resources. He said the new system will be used across the 47 counties and will be integrated with National Government systems. President Uhuru said currently counties are using 11 different revenue collection systems, which are not integrated with those used by the National Government or even those used by other counties. “The bottom line is, this has severely limited the amount of revenue collected by the counties,” said the President. He spoke at KICC where he was updated on the progress of a multi-agency geospatial mapping project of Kenya. “To eliminate this duplication of efforts and waste of resources, I hereby direct the Commission on Revenue Allocation, the Council of Governors, the National Treasury and the Kenya Revenue Authority to form a Multi-Agency Team whose principal aim shall be to deliver on a single revenue collection system, that is integrated with National Government Systems and to be used across all 47 Counties,” the President ordered. He said the Taskforce working on the revenue collection system must take into account the work done by the Multi-Agency Team on Joint National Resource Mapping Project. The mapping task force did a presentation on the progress it has achieved so far at very minimal costs as compared to what it would have cost taxpayers if private firms were contracted for the job. ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru said the team has already produced 75 maps including some that will help the National Government and counties enhance revenue collection and utilization. "If revenue collection systems are integrated with the map, it will be easy, for example, to know who has paid land rates," the President observed. Click here for the latest political news
