Decaying meat yesterday made the Limuru law court a smelly place. A man was last Saturday arrested with the meat suspected to be destined for Nairobi. Flies buzzed around the Toyota Sienta that was allegedly impounded by the Kenya Forest Service officials with the suspected wild meat. People at the court had to cover their noses as the smell was overwhelming. On Saturday KFS rangers Joseph Kahoti, Johnstone Kitonga, Antony Maina and Daughlas Wafula stopped the car, conducted a search and discovered the meat stashed in bags. Suspect Simon Kariuki Njoroge denied three charges. He appeared before resident magistrate Frederick Koome. He was charged with being in possession of wildlife meat. The charge sheet stated that on February 2, he was found in possession of 600kg of zebra meat. The magistrate said the suspect will be released on Sh200,000 bond or Sh120,000 bail. The prosecution objected his release on bail. The magistrate ordered the suspect be detained at Tigoni police station for investigations to be complete. The case will be mentioned on Friday.
