African Club Championship returnees Kenya Commercial Bank women’s volleyball team have upped their training as they seek to win their second title on the continental stage next month in Cairo, Egypt. The side, under the stewardship of Japheth Munala and David Muthui, return to March 16-25 event after three years in the cold and have already moved their training sessions to the indoor facility at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The bankers finished second during last year’s Kenya Volleyball Federation national league play-offs behind champions Kenya Prisons’ to  earn a ticket to the annual event that will see the eventual winner book a slot to the World Club Championship. KCB coach Munala said early preparation gives them confidence ahead of the event, which they last won in 2006 in Mauritius. “After the play-offs, we returned to training and broke camp few days to Christmas before resuming proper training early last month. All these arrangements have benefitted the team even as we begun our indoor sessions on Thursday,” said Munala. He said the system of play is slowly but surely falling in place with the team planning to depart early to the host nation on March 8. “Myself and six other players came to KCB from Kenya Pipeline and it goes without saying that it takes time for some things to fall in place but so far, so good. The players have gelled well and we can only hope for the best,” said Munala, who doubles up as the national women’s team head coach. He added: “Our training is going on well and all the departments are working in unison. We are glad and happy that our management has made it easy for us to start indoor training that will help us adjust well ahead of the event, as compared to training at the outdoor facility.” The six players who decamped to KCB from Pipeline are Noel Murambi, Leonida Kasaya, Violet Makuto, Christne Njambi, Jemima Siangu and Truphosa Chepkemei.
