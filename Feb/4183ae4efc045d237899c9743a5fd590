The Director of Criminal Investigations has arrested four members of a gang that has been terrorising residents of Kilimani. They are Alex Nderi alias Ade, Peter Kaari alias Pinches/Walker, Lawrence Alusala alias Nico and Veronica Kamau alias Veroh. The suspects appeared in court on Monday. They were arrested after the DCI reviewed CCTV footage and trapped the suspects. “After the incidents were reported, DCI detectives launched investigations whereby CCTV footage was retrieved and analysed. A black Prado with fake number plates was identified and later traced to a broker who had hired it to some suspects. "A trap was laid and the four suspects were arrested,” the DCI said. One of the suspects led detectives to Kwihota in Ruiru town where a firearm and 14 bullets that had been stolen from a Chinese national were recovered. Detectives have also detained two vehicles that were being used by the suspects. Click here for the latest political news
