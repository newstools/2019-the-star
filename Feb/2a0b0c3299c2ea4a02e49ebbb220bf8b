Good morning Seven suspects accused of impersonating President Uhuru Kenyatta have challenged the prosecution to produce him in court as a witness. The seven - Joseph Waswa, Duncan Muchai, Isaac Wajekeche, William Simiyu, David Luganya, Gilbert Kirunja and Anthony Wafula told a magistrate the law does not bar Kenyatta from appearing as a witness or complainant in the case. Here are the other stories making headlines in the Star this morning. The flashy life of Uhuru mimic Waswa He has been running charity initiatives, driving high-end luxury vehicles and flying in choppers; and to many unsuspecting Kenyans, cutting the image of an established philanthropist. Not any more. The unmasked 33-year-old Joseph Waswa, who mimicked President Uhuru Kenyatta and conned businessman Naushed Merali of a cool Sh80 million, is a controversial and scandal-ridden fake millionaire. _____________________________________________________ Robbery victim hospitalised in KNH for two years A raid at his M-Pesa shop two years ago left Robert Wanyonyi paralysed, hospitalised and helpless. He is detained in the hospital because he is unable to raise Sh4 million hospital bill. He was discharged six months ago but his family has been unable to raise the cash. Wanyonyi was going about his daily routine at 6.30am on may 2, 2017, in Pipeline estate when three robbers stormed his shop.
