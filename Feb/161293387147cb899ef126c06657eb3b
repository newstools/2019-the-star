Bungoma MCAs have been urged to mobilise residents to take part in the August census. Governor Wycliffe Wangamati told a special seating of the Bungoma assembly that a high turn out of residents during the census will ensure more resources are allocated to the county. The governor urged the MCAs to take a keen interest in the proposed County Government Equitable Distribution of Resources bill now at the Senate. The Bill seeks to cure deficiencies that resulted in the annulment of Ward Development Fund and Community Empowerment Fund. Wangamati said that through the Bill, county assemblies will be converted into organs that determine the criteria of how money was allocated to wards-based projects.
