11 counties are set to start their strike Monday over the unsettled return to work formula signed between the government and council of governors. KNUN secretary general Seth Panyako insists that the strike is still on and they have not received any message from government officials nor the council of governors over it. The CoG has however distanced itself from the looming strike. In a letter to KNUN, governors have directed nurses to negotiate with various officials in affected counties. The government has however formed a committee to spear head talk with nurses. Panyako reiterated that the strike is still on, "Mgomo upo na hakuna kurudi nyuma," Counties to be affected include Kisumu, Nyeri, West Pokot, Taita Taveta, Kitui, Trans Nzoia, Elgeyo Marakwet,Wajir, Nyandarua, Kisii and Nairobi. The CoG on Saturday said it expects the nurses' strike standoff to be resolved quickly to avoid paralysing health services across the country. Labour CS Ukur Yattani appointed Harun Mwaura, Abisai AbengeÂ (FKE) and Benson Okwaro of Cotu as the lead conciliators in the pay talks. The ministry also asked the KNUN to call off the strike to pave the way for the conciliation process.
