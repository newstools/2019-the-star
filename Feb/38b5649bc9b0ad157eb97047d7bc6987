The Nairobi branch of the national nurses union has threatened to call a work boycott to protest against the assault on two of their colleagues at Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital last week. The senseless action by people who had taken a patient to the facility for treatment deserves unreserved condemnation. The assault comes two months after a similar assault took place at Kenyatta National Hospital, where a nurse was severely attacked, again by an outsider. This is a worrying trend. Hospitals are the last place where physical assaults should happen. Nurses, doctors and other health workers and their charges should never be subjected to violence. While the details of what precipitated the attack are still scant, security must be improved in all health institutions to ensure that caregivers are never again subjected to violence from whatever quarter. We understand and appreciate the feelings of the nursesâ€™ union. They have every reason to feel aggrieved. However, union leaders should let the law take its course. Already two suspects have been arrested. We should avoid pouring into the streets in protest every time we are aggrieved by those with a criminal bent.
