Mohamed Nurrow Mohamed, a suspect linked to last month's explosion on Latema road, Nairobi, has been remanded for three days to enable police complete investigations. Mohamed was arrested on Friday last week in Moyale at the Kenya-Ethiopia border. The Anti-Terror Police Unit says it is pursuing other suspects believed to have planned the explosion together with him. "The investigations are complex and require time since it involves a number of agencies," ATPU stated in its affidavit. ATPU had asked for five days to complete investigations but the court only allowed a three day detention. Officer Adan Hassan said intelligence reports show that Mohamed worked with accomplices to execute the blast on the night of January 26. Hassan said they are concerned that he may interfere with investigations if released. Mohamed is being investigated for conspiring to commit a terrorist act.
