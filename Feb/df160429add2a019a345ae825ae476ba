The tragic death of activist Caroline Mwatha, who died of a botched abortion — whether voluntarily procured or forcibly performed — should make us reflect of safe abortion. We should also ponder decriminalising the procedure in the first trimester, the practice in many Western countries. Opinion in Kenya is deeply divided. No one on either side of the debate likes the idea of abortion. Some are absolutely opposed, even in the case of a 9-year-old girl raped, made pregnant by her father and kicked out of her home. They say it's murder, even at the moment of conception, though the medical definition of pregnancy is embedding of a fertilised egg in the wall of the uterus. They further say that legalising abortion would promote promiscuity. Kenyan law makes abortion illegal in virtually all circumstances, unless a certified health professional says the life or health of the mother is in danger. In 2013 the  Health ministry withdrew guidelines on performing safe abortions, a simple procedure early on, and on handling botched abortions. It has banned health workers from training on abortion. This is wrong and hasn't stopped women from seeking and dying from back-alley abortions. Let's give thought to saving lives.
