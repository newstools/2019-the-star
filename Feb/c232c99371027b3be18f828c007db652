The Ministry of Lands yesterday denied claims by Nairobi county that it duped President Uhuru Kenyatta into presenting dummy title deeds to landowners in Embakasi last year. Lands Chief Administration Secretary Gideon Mungaro said all the beneficiaries got their documents and more titles are still being processed. “The ministry cannot produce fake titles,” Mungaro told the Senate Lands and Environment committee. “The claims are purely malicious and unfounded,” he said. The CAS said the titles were being issued from different departments, including the county housing department, National Social Security Fund and the National Health Insurance Fund. Last week, Lands executive Charles Kerich told the County Assembly and Planning Committee that only 50 of the 50,000 titles the President issued at Jacaranda Grounds last May were genuine. Mungaro, however, said more than 20,000 have been issued to legitimate land owners since the Nairobi Titling Programme started. Kerich had told the Assembly committee that only 623 title deeds had been issued to residents. The CAS said his ministry was tackling a stalemate over ownership of land, including the Embakasi Ranch whose real owners have taken a long time to identify. “We are doing Ruai-Embakasi ranch which has been in existence for 42 years, ” he said. The ministry has distributed 24,000 title deeds with 12,000 remaining.
