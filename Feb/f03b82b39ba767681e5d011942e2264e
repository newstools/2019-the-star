Former Moi University acting vice chancellor Prof Laban Ayiro has been appointed the vice chancellor of Daystar University. The university's council chairman Henry Thairu said the appointment takes effect from March 1. "The appointment of Prof Ayiro follows a rigorous process which started on December 5, 2018," Tahiru said on Friday. He said the council settled on Ayiro as the university's fourth VC after interviewing six potential candidates from 30 applicants whose names were forwarded by the human resource consultant, Manpower Limited. 'The new vice chancellor will be taken through an elaborate one-month induction, orientation and handover process by the acting vice chancellor Prof James Kombo," Thairu said.

Wachira was shown the door after chaos rocked the institution's twin campuses in Nairobi and Athi River in December 2017. Students accused him of misappropriation of funds and poor leadership. Until his appointment, Prof Ayiro was the acting VC at Moi University between September 2016 and March 2018. He replaced Prof Richard Mibey whose term had ended. Prof Ayiro was largely expected to take over as Moi University's VC after a rigorous interviewing process but was allegedly "rigged out" on tribal basis. Isaac Kosgey was then appointed to take over as the VC at the Eldoret based institution.
