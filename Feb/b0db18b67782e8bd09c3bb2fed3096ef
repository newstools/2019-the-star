A case in which a Chinese national is charged with killing his compatriot and critically injuring her husband failed to take off at the High Court in Narok for lack of an interpreter. The case came up for hearing on Wednesday before Narok resident judge Justice Justus Bwonwong`a. Senior assistant director in the department of public prosecutions Zachary Omwega applied for an adjournment since there was no one to translate the proceedings for the suspect Li Chanquing in Mandarin - a language spoken by Chinese. Omwega told the court that the interpreter they were expecting was held up with other emerging issues in Nairobi. His request was granted and the case will now be heard on February 18 and 19. Chanquing, 45, is charged with the murder of Jinli Liu, also 45 on August 8, last year at Keekorok Lodge in the Maasai Mara National Game Reserve. He faces another charge of causing grievous harm to her husband Yi Dong, 47, on the material day. Chanquing is alleged to have stabbed the Chinese couple after disagreeing on a seating arrangement. The suspect accused the couple of taking over his table. Chanquing, who addressed the court through a Chinese translator, has denied committing the offence and is out on a Sh1 million bond with a surety of similar amount. He was also required to deposit his passport in court. If found guilty, he faces the mandatory death sentence. Click here for the latest political news
