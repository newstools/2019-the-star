A one-week animal vaccination drive targeting cattle, dogs and cats has started in Kakamega. Sme 400,000 households are expected to be covered before the campaign ends of February 6, according to Deputy governor Philip Kutima. Kutima, who is also the executive for Agriculture and Livestock Development, spoke when he launched the drive at Matete market in Malava on Thursday. “We want to move with speed to prevent the spread of animal diseases,” he said. The drive is aimed at curbing the spread of diseases like foot and mouth, lumpy skin, East Coast fever and rabies in dogs and cats. The diseases are very rampant in the county. “We’ve more than enough vaccines so everyone who owns a cow, dog and a cat should present them for free vaccination,” Kutima said. He called on residents to adopt dairy farming and poultry keeping to improve their income. Chief officer Nelly Nelima said rabies is fatal and asked residents to ensure their dogs were vaccinated. “It’s cheaper to vaccinate a dog than to treat a person who has been bitten,” Nelima said.
