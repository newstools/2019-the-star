Good Morning. Kenyans go into the weekend a happy lot after the Energy Regulatory Commission slashed fuel prices further to push the cost of diesel and kerosene to below Sh100. With petrol now at Sh100.09, fuel prices hit a year's low giving more relief to motorists and households who started paying up to Sh10 less per litre in January. Here are the other stories making headlines in the Star this Friday morning. How police killed Baby Pendo in Kisumu Kisumu Resident Magistrate Beryl Omollo on Thursday graphically explained how police officers killed a six-month-old baby Samantha Pendo during protests in 2017 after disputed presidential elections. In a moment of wanton and unproved violence, police officers who had been given express orders to protect life and property had violated both the properties of the residents of Kilo Junction. In addition, they cruelly smashed the life out of an innocent and helpless infant Samantha Pendo with the court ordering Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji to take necessary actions against the officers. _____________________________________________________ Jubilee MPs dismiss Kuria's claim on Duale ouster A push by Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria to remove his Garissa Town counterpart Aden Duale as National Assembly Majority leader has triggered sharp reactions in Jubilee. On Thursday, Jubilee MPs dismissed Kuria’s bid to have Duale stripped of his powerful and influential position. The lawmakers who spoke to the Star accused the controversial Gatundu legislator of trying to trigger an implosion within  the ruling Jubilee Party. _____________________________________________________ Private security regulator disowns Fazul on call to arm guards A board charged with regulating security firms has disowned statements by its chief executive Fazul Mahamed that guards will be issued with guns in June. The Private Security Regulatory Authority (PSRA) says the plan to arm guards can only be effected after the law barring such a move is repealed. During a meeting at Railways Club in Nairobi last month, Fazul intimated that the agency would begin vetting guards to determine their suitability to handle guns. _____________________________________________________ Slums fear and revere ‘killer police squads’ In the dark underbelly of Nairobi’s slums, the rule of law is often enforced with ruthless abandon. From Benteke in Makadara to Blackie in Kibera to Rashid in Mathare, certain cops are a law unto themselves. While the general public refers to them as ‘Hessy’, slum dwellers know them as either super or killer cops. Here, they are dreaded and revered in equal measure. _____________________________________________________ Illicit cigarette trade denying KRA massive revenue -BAT Seven hundred million counterfeited cigarettes were traded in Kenya last year, according to a market research by leading manufacturer BAT.
