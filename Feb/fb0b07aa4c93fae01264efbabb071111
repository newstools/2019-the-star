Australian miner Base Titanium could lose over Sh10.23 billion ($102.2 million) in revenue if their expansion plans are stopped. Acting GM external affairs Simon Wall equated this to revenue made in the six months to December. The firm said it is struggling to begin exploration works in 136 square kilometres Vanga area after acquiring a prospecting licence approved by the Mineral Rights Board in December. The area covers a strip from Likoni to the Kenya-Tanzania Lunga Lunga border with a 10km distance between land and the coast. The company plans to start drilling in March. “No exploration has started in Vanga. Consultation with the community has proven difficult because we cannot get in touch with every person,but we are in the process of sensitising them on the economic impact of exploration in order to get the first level of consent,” Wall said. The company additionally applied and granted for a north eastern and south extension of the central mines which nears depletion with only four years left for mining. The south dune has only three months of mine life, but they have met opposition from the community in the north area. “The problem is access to drill. It is disappointing because we believe there are prospects of quality ore in the area. But if it is not possible then we will have no option but to pack and leave,” Wall said. The company has been unrelenting on its expansion bid despite a variance in ore mined to minerals obtained. In the second half of 2018, the company mined 11,333,000 tonnes of ore but only exported 609,000 tonnes of combined rutile, zircon and ilmenite minerals.
