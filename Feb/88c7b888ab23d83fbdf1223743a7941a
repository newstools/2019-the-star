Fast-rising left attacker Sharon Chepchumba is a surprise exclusion from the 22-member team that will represent Kenya Prisons at this year’s Kenya Volleyball Federation national league and the Africa Club Championship. Chepchumba made her debut at last year’s Africa Club Championships in Egypt, where Prisons finished fourth and went ahead to make her maiden appearance for the national team at the World Championships in Japan. The former Kwanthanze Secondary School player was also instrumental in reclaiming the KVF trophy for Prisons after five years of trying. Despite her short stint at the top level, the player is already being equated to former national team attacker,  Dorcas Ndasaba, owing to her hard-hitting spikes and the immeasurable confidence she exhibits. However, the left attacker has not been attending training sessions at Nairobi West grounds with sources hinting that the player might be on her way to Kenya Pipeline. Prisons’ head coach Josp Barasa confirmed that the player was no longer in his plans. Barasa said it will be unfair to enter a player for this year’s assignments when she has not been attending training sessions . He said: “Chepchumba is not in my plans. How do you field a player when you haven’t seen her in the training and when you don’t know her whereabouts.” Barasa, who doubles up as the national women’s team assistant coach, added: “She is a good player and there is no doubt about that. However, her absence in the team will give chance to other players to excel and so far, we are not worried. The training is going on well and we only hope for the best going forward.” In the absence of the Chepchumba, Barasa will have to work with experienced trio of Mercy Moim who is away for a short stint with Club Supreme of Thailand, Evelyne Makuto, Loise Jepkosgei, promising  duo of Pamela Masaisai and Meldine Sande and Yvonne Wavinya.
