Parliament has ordered the direct sourcing of an auditor to scrutinise the accounts of the Office of the Auditor General. Three previous attempts to hire a firm to audit the Edward Ouko-led office have failed after committees cited conflict of interest of applicants. In the last bid, RSM East Africa’s application was thrown out despite beating eight bidders. In a January 30 letter, Clerk Michael Sialai asked the Public Accounts Committee to hire an auditor from a Commonwealth country. The committee is chaired by Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi. The contractor is expected to study the Auditor General’s accounts for the four financial years from 2014-15. The Parliamentary Service Commission began the search for an auditor in June 2016 when four firms submitted their bids. An evaluation committee recommended that a M/s Baker Tilly Merali be awarded the tender since it was the lowest bidder. The commission notified the company of the tender award but the firm lost the tender after MPs raised issues of conflict of interest. The last attempt saw RSM Eastern Africa rejected, also for conflict of interest. The firm beat Kiarie Kang’ethe and Co, Grant Thornton, JG Bailey and Associates, Baker Tilly Meralli’s, PKF Kenya, Ronald and Associates, Nelson and Associates, and Walubengo and Associates. “In view of the said events, we have been unable to procure services of an auditor to scrutinise the accounts of the Auditor General on account of non-responsiveness and conflict of interest,” Sialai said.
