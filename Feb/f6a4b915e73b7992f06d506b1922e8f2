Former Jubilee vice-chairman David Murathe does not merit my response, Deputy President William Ruto has said. "I have not responded to Murathe in Kenya, I am not about to respond to him in Europe, he does not merit my response," Ruto said. Murathe resigned as Jubilee Party vice chairman on January 6 and has openly campaigned against Ruto's presidential ambitions in 2022. He maintains that the DP is unfit to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta after serving as the country's second in command for two consecutive terms.

"I am ready to respond to any allegation against my character or in anything I engage in. But the decision of Jubilee candidate is not a personal decision but that of a political party called Jubilee," he said. On Wednesday, Murathe said many popular Jubilee aspirants were rigged out during the 2017 nominations. He said a team was hell-bent on imposing its preferred candidates on voters. Murathe told Citizen TV in an interview that it was from the shambolic primaries that his woes with the DP began. Ruto spearheaded the primaries.
