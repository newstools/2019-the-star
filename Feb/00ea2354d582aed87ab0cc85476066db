A UN agency this year plans to treat 3,404 children suffering from acute malnutrition. The beneficiaries will be aged between six months and five years. In its Humanitarian Action for Children 2019 report released on Friday, Unicef said it also plans to save the lives of 325,000 children affected by acute watery diarrhoea, malaria or measles. “The global acute malnutrition prevalence rate remains critical, at between 15 and 30 per cent in Mandera, Turkana, Samburu and parts of Baringo and Marsabit,” it says. “Only 250,000 people have access to the agreed quantity of water for drinking, cooking and personal hygiene in Kenya. The plan will ensure 5,575 children (52 per cent girls) are provided with psychosocial support, including access to child-friendly spaces.” Another 59,000 children of school-going age, including adolescents (50 per cent girls), will be provided with formal or informal early learning, pre-primary, primary or secondary education. According to the report, children are at risk of immediate harm from targeted and indiscriminate attacks, as well as abuses such as sexual and gender-based violence, abduction and recruitment into armed militias and groups in cases of conflicts. Disease outbreaks continue to hurt vulnerable populations in Kenya, with Type 2 Polio virus reported in Nairobi, it says. This is based on the fact that Kenya hosts more than 468,000 asylum seekers, of whom 56 per cent are children. The country is also vulnerable to the havoc wreaked by heavy rains, which could lead to climate-related emergencies this year. The report says more than 800,000 people were affected by flooding March and September last year, including some 311,000 who were displaced.
