Governor Cornel Rasanga’s administration is on the radar of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission over allegations of illegal recruitments. The agency’s detectives were to pitch tent in Siaya from Friday to investigate. Regional manager Ignatius Wekesa on Thursday said they would look at the county budget, the lists of applicants, and shortlisted and successful candidates. They will also target reports and other documents by the County Public Service Board in relation to their interviews. On Thursday, the board disowned Rasanga’s chief officer nominees. The names were sent to the county assembly for approval. But board vice chairperson Florence Oketch told the assembly’s Committee on Appointments that they had no knowledge of the list. She dismissed claims by the governor that the board had vetted the individuals. On Friday, efforts to get the executive’s response were unsuccessful. County secretary Dave Anyona did not return calls or respond to text messages. Last week, West Asembo MCA Ambrose Akuno and Gem and Rarieda residents urged the assembly to reject the names, citing lack of regional and gender balance. Board member John Okere said the issues raised by the ward rep and the residents were “very genuine and the list must be thrown out”. Oketch said they were surprised to learn that one nominee is a member of the board. She expressed concern that illegal hiring is being carried out behind their back. “We don’t even remember any day we delegated recruitment duties to anyone for the list to be presented behind our back to the assembly for approval,” Oketch told the MCAs. Board member Ishmael Noor added, “The chief officers issue is just a tip of the iceberg on how the recruitment process in Siaya is flawed.” Assembly Speaker George Okoda said they will make the right recommendations.
