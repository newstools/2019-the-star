Nandi Governor Stephen Sang yesterday asked the state about a heroin ship blown up in Mombasa in 2014. It’s new twist in his war with Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho. Joho has sued Sang and three MPs — Oscar Sudi, Kimani Ichung’wah and Didmus Barasa — for defamation. In an application filed yesterday, Sang wants the state to reveal the owner of the ship that had carried 70.8kg of heroin worth Sh1.3 billion. The ship was blown up on August 29 off Mombasa as President Uhuru Kenyatta watched. The President violated court orders to preserve the vessel as evidence. Lawyer Danstan Omari asked for information on the Amin Darya/MV Alnoor, saying it will helpSang. Joho sued the four for allegedly spreading lies that he was a drug trafficker. He said they have maliciously and callously used falsehoods, gossip and slanderous language to maximise hatred against him. Joho said he has never been indicted for a drugs-related offence or raded in illicit drugs and narcotics, as alleged by the accused. Sang said information on the ship’s owner will vindicate him. “It will accelerate the fight against trafficking by promoting a society that is well informed, vigilant and protective of current and future generations.” Omari said. Sang has written to the EACC, Uhuru, CSs Rachel Omamo and Fred Matiang’i and DCI and the IG.
