Governors want to scrap the two-term limit so they can stand for election multiple times, the Star reported yesterday. Article 180 (7) of the Constitution prohibits a governor or deputy governor from serving more than two terms. A draft document by a special committee of the Council of Governors argues that it is unfair to limit governors to two terms when MCAs and MPs can repeatedly stand for election. Term limits protect us from incumbents. An incumbent president is very difficult to dislodge. An incumbent governor will also be difficult to dislodge because he controls the county budget. Governors and presidents are executive administrators. MPs and MCAs are legislators. They are different. MPs don't have the same power to influence elections so only 40 per cent get re-elected. We don't need term limits for MPs but we do need them for governors and presidents. Finally, if we abolish terms limits for governors, we will end up abolishing them for the President. Do we want a life President? It is a bad idea to abolish term limits for governors. Quote of the day: "If there were no bad people, there would be no good lawyers."
