The court has found five top police bosses who served in Kisumu during the 2017 general elections culpable for the death of a six-month-old Baby Samantha Pendo. The 31 officers will now be investigated by ODPP after being found to be persons of interest. Resident Magistrate Beryl Omollo ordered DPP Noordin Haji to take necessary actions against the officers. Baby Pendo died in August 2017 after she was clobbered on the head allegedly by police in her parents’ Nyalenda slum house. The five include former OCS John Thiringi, former county commander Titus Yoma, former OCPD Kisumu East Christopher Mutune, Inspector of police Linah Kogei and Benjamin Koima AP commandant Kisumu central. "Am so happy that at last justice has been served, let my baby rest in peace," baby Samantha Pendo's mum Lencer Achieng said. The officers were responding to the chaos that rocked the lakeside city after Uhuru Kenyatta was declared the winner of the August 8, 2017, presidential elections. Government chemist Joseph Gitonga brought to the court a report on the exhibits provided by IPOA investigator, including a teargas canister. During the inquest, lawyers said the police service should be held responsible for the child’s murder since it could not identify the individuals responsible.
