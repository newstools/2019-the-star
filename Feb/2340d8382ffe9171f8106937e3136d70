The woman who was arrested filming traffic officers harassing a female passenger in Nairobi on Tuesday will not be charged. This is after the office of the DPP at Makadara court rejected the charges against her. The prosecution said the woman had not committed any crime. "We cannot charge anyone just because the police have arrested her filming them do their work, we rejected the file since it is not a crime to take a film in public," one of the prosecutors told the Star. She said police need to have enough evidence to warrant the prosecution of an accused. We don't want to take cases in court without evidence or the ones the court might reject" she added. She said that DPP Noordin Haji has called for the file. Sophia Njeri was arrested and later released on a police cash bail of Sh10,000. She was to appear today at the court for plea taking on charges of obstruction to Justice. In a viral video, Njeri was seen filming the officers pulling a lady from the front seat of a matatu plying the Kasarani â€“ Nairobi CBD route. On Tuesday, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority condemned the arrest adding that they had raised the matter with Kasarani police station.
