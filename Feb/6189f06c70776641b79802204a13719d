DRC President Felix Tshisekedi has arrived in Nairobi for talks with President Uhuru Kenyatta after his inauguration last month. Tshisekedi arrived on Wednesday afternoon where he was received by Foreign affairs CS Monica Juma and Nairobi governor Mike Sonko at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Tshisekedi is on a maiden tour of three Africa countries and was in Angola before coming to Nairobi then head to Congo Republic. The new DRC President enjoys a special relationship with Uhuru who was the only Head of State at his inauguration last month. Uhuru and African Union Special Envoy Raila Odinga held behind-the-scenes lobbying for the region to accept Tshisekedi’s election as the DRC president. The two hitherto bitter political rivals-turned-friends played key a role in convincing the East African Community as well as SADC to recognise Tshesekedi’s disputed election victory. Following Uhuru and Raila’s shuttle diplomacy, Tshisekedi was on January 24 installed to succeed retired President Joseph Kabila as the Congolese leader. Uhuru, Raila and his Wiper counterpart Kalonzo Musyoka were among leaders who attended Tshisekedi's inauguration in the DRC last month. They were accompanied by Suna East MP Junet Mohamed and his Homa Bay counterpart Gladys Wanga along with senators Ledama Ole Kina (Narok) and Amos Wako (Busia).
