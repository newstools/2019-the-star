An emoji that will signify a tiny “manhood” symbol is set to hit your keyboard this year as the Unicode Consortium has announced 230 new emojis to be released. The nonprofit organization said the emoji will be of a hand with the thumb and index finger closing in on each other with the three other fingers curled back to symbolize a small male sex organ. According to emojipedia, the hand gesture is used to describe something very small. In addition, a drop of blood will also be part of the new emojis to be released signifying a woman who is going through her menstrual cycle. In order to cater for persons living with disability, there will be a person gesturing to their ear to indicate deafness, an ear with a hearing aid, someone in a wheelchair and a character walking with a cane. “The new emoji typically start showing up on mobile phones in September/October — some platforms may release them earlier. The new emoji will soon be available for adoption to help the Unicode Consortium’s work on digitally disadvantaged languages”, Unicode said. For those who love cooking or would like to write a shopping list for their partners, they should expect to see garlic, butter and onions among the new food emojis. Unicode added, the people holding hands emoji will have four combinations of gender and all the various combinations of skin tones, for a total of 71 new variants. Many people were surprised on Twitter with Kathryn Brandt‏ @KBtheFirst tweeting “Thank God! I’ve been hoping and praying that the tiny penis emoji would become a thing." HighlandFreethinkers‏ @Highlandfreethi tweeted “Whilst the 'tiny penis' emoji slips under the radar because it's ok to male bash" The new emojis are expected to roll out later this year on major platforms like Apple and Google products.
