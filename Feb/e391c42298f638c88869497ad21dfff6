The government will deal ruthlessly with those behind insecurity in Nyandarua county especially livestock thieves, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has said. He said dairy farmers have been reduced to paupers by livestock thieves. The CS was responding to leaders who pleaded for action on insecurity during the launch of a potato seed multiplication project at NYS Tumaini camp on Friday. Matiang’i directed security agencies in the county to end cattle theft. He said additional resources will be given to police this week and a quiet operation will be launched to stop the network behind the crimes. He advised the culprits to present themselves to the police before the government goes for them. “If you know those people, tell them to go to the police or we shall come for them,” he said. Matiang’i said cannot allow a situation where citizens spend sleepless nights due to cattle theft. The CS said two police patrol bases would be established in Nyandarua to enhance security. The bases will eventually be upgraded to police stations. He said soon the government will lease 300 vehicles for police officers.
