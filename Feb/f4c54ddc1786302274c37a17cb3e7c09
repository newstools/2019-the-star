Chief Justice David Maraga has told lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi to file a petition on the alleged bribery of some judges during the Wajir gubernatorial ruling. The Supreme Court overturned decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal nullifying the election of Wajir Governor Mohammed Abdi Mohamud on February 15.

"Corruption is endemic and it is there even in the Judiciary. In the last few weeks, Ahmednasir publicly claimed that some judges were bribed to decide the Wajir petition in the way they did," Maraga said. "I challenge him to file the petition at the Judicial Service Commission we will take appropriate action with the evidence presented." Maraga spoke when he released the 2017/19 annual report on the State of Judiciary at the Supreme Court. The event was graced by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto among other dignitaries. On Wednesday, Supreme Court Judge Mohammed Ibrahim wrote to Ahmednasir demanding an apology for publishing defamatory words against him over the Wajir petition. Justice Ibrahim, through his lawyer Wambua Kilonzo, gave Ahmednassir seven days to retract the words published on his Twitter account and offer an apology, failure to which he will move to court.
