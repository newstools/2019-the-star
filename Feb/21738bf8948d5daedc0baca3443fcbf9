The Kenya Ports Authority on Friday launched its five-year ( 2018-2022 ) plan to improve services at the Mombasa port. KPA managing director Daniel Manduku said there has been an upward trajectory of the port’s performance since 2014, when it first handled one million containers (Total Equivalent Units). In the last five years, container traffic has grown 28.71 per cent to 1.3 million TEUs last year compared to 1.01 million TEUs handled in 2014. Manduku said their target is to handle 1.599 million TEUs by 2022. “We have seen an upward trend in the port handling capacity in container traffic. Last year we handled 1.3 million TEUs and we are looking forward to handle 1.6 million TEUs by the year 2022,” he said. Manduku said the port, which currently collects about Sh40 billion in revenue, will increase gains to Sh64 billion by 2022. Speaking during the launch, he said transit cargo currently stands at 9.6 million Dead Weight Tonnes (DWT). The target is to have 11.5 million DWT in five years. Uganda is still the leader of Kenya’s transit market at 82.1 per cent, South Sudan 7.6 per cent, Rwanda 2.4 per cent, Burundi 0.2 per cent and others 0.1 per cent. Manduku said KPA is targeting to reduce turn-around time for all vessels from the current 3.4 days to three days in the next five years.
