The inauguration of a new Kerio Valley Development Authority board of directors has been put on hold amid investigation into two Sh65 billion hydropower dams in Elgeyo Marakwet. Board chairman Jackson Kiptanui was this week to convene a meeting where 21 members were to be inaugurated. Kiptanui and CEO David Kimosop could not be reached for comment on developments at KVDA. “We have been asked to wait until further notice,” one of the new board members said in confidence. The appointment of the new directors has raised more confusion after Regional Development CS Adan Mohammed appointed 21 board members in excess of the number required under the KVDA Act. Most of those appointed are politicians from the region and the parastatal will have to spend extra millions on monthly allowances, night outs and insurance covers on the bloated board, should all of them be inaugurated. Four of the appointees are from Baringo county, raising questions on the rationale of the appointments. West Pokot and Turkana community representatives, led by Paul Luturko and James Nakuleu, have written to the CS asking him to reduce the number of the members. Two weeks ago, the government appointed 10 new independent directors to the KVDA board to add to the three who had been picked last year and another eight who are representatives of line ministries. The ministries - with one representative each on the board - include Treasury, Water, Regional Development, Agriculture, Health, the Attorney General and Office of the President. The CEO is by virtue of his position also a director. CS Mohammed had gazetted the new names. They are Pauline Lenguris, Francisca Ereng, Andrew Karumbo, Adan Omar, Leonard Sang, George Irungu, James Kiprop, Grace Were, Eric Bett and Susan Chesiyna. Kiptanui was late last year appointed to be chairman of the board along with Dinah Chelang’a and David Komen as independent directors. This means the board has 13 independent directors instead of 10.
