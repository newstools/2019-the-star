Nurses in Nyandarua resumed work on Monday evening after an agreement with the county government on the implementation of the return to work agreement signed on November 2, 2017. Over 400 nurses had on Monday afternoon downed their tools accusing the county administration of dishonesty and lack of goodwill after a delay in holding talks aimed at averting the strike.

They asked their members to leave their workstations and went ahead to lock various departments at the hospitals. However, the strike was suspended a few hours later after union officials met with the county government officials and negotiated a solution to the stalemate. In a joint statement signed by Nyandarua county secretary, Hiram Kahiro and Kenya National Union of Nurses Nyandarua branch secretary John Gachara, the two parties agreed on suspending the strike. “The county government has directed the implementation of the Return to Work Agreement signed by the County Government, National Government and the Kenya National Union of Nurses on November 2, 2017, alongside salaries for March 2019," the statement read in part. The bone of contention was the uniform allowance and nursing service allowance. Gachara said this money will be paid in three instalments, from March 29, 2019.
