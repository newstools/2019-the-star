Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has accused Majority leader Aden Duale of frustrating most of his private bills by ensuring they do not get to the floor of the House. Speaking on Citizen TV on Wednesday night, Kuria also reiterated his earlier claims that Duale is plotting to have him de-whipped from both the Transport and Budget committees. "None of my legislative proposals has ever been brought to the House since 2014. From NGO’s Reform Bill (2014) to the Coffee Bill, the Interest Rates Bill and now the one he has sworn to defeat - Select Committee to support Matiang’i and his committee," Kuria said. He accused Duale of being arrogant and full of himself, adding that he is not fit to be the Leader of Majority. “So many MPs are very frustrated by Duale. He is always having extra time to make all sort of jokes when members do not even get one minute to talk. Let Duale remove me from the committees, then I will call for a leadership challenge and beat him heads down to become the Leader of Majority,” Kuria said. The outspoken MP, who also wants to run for the Presidency in 2022, also exuded confidence that he will beat Deputy President William Ruto in the polls. “I will beat Ruto. The DP will be a very strong second to me," he said. Asked whether he has the financial muscle to match the DP, he said, “It is IEBC that will announce the winner not the Central Bank of Kenya. “I am rich at heart. Ruto is only four years older than me…we are agemates,” he said.
