A Chinese contractor was yesterday told to hasten the construction of the Sh64 billion Thwake Multi-Purpose Dam as it was 12 per cent behind schedule. Water CS Simon Chelugui said only 7.4 per cent of the anticipated work has been completed against the scheduled 19 per cent. Chelugui, who was on a tour of the dam site, said the contractor had not mobilised enough machines and personnel. “We can’t expect progress with trucks in the parking. I have flown over the site and most of those I have seen are parked,” he said. The CS said he had asked the project management committee to write a protest letter. The tender was awarded to Ghezuba Company. It should be completed in the next 44 months. The CS was afraid the contractor might not deliver in time. He was accompanied by governors Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni), Alfred Mutua (Machakos) and Charity Ngilu (Kitui). The dam is at the confluence of River Athi and River Thwake on border of Kitui and Makueni counties. Chelugui faulted the contractor on job distribution, saying local people had been denied opportunities as sub-contractors. Mavindini MCA Jonathan Kimngo and his Kanyangi counterpart Andrew Ndisya complained about the “biased” hiring. They accused the contractor of hiring unskilled foreigners. Residents demanded the contractor sinks boreholes because some water points have been blocked by the project. Chelugui directed the project management committee to resolve the issues raised and file a report within a month. The CS said compensation of 186 landowners will be expedited. “You will be paid before the project is launched,” he said. Click here for the latest political news
