Kikuyu gospel artiste Ben Githae says the Tano Tena song changed his life financially. "The song did not leave me the way I was before financially because I got so many benefits that I cannot explain," Githae told Word Is on Tuesday. The song focused on the Head of State's development record, touching on various projects, among them the Standard Gauge Railway, roads and free maternity. Githae received backlash from the public, with many finding fault with him for taking a political stand, but he defended his move. “I strongly believe Kenya is a democratic state and everyone is entitled to support who they want," he said. Some churches even labelled Githae a divisive figure, whose song did not bring out the values of the institution. They accused him of selling his soul and prioritising money over the gospel. "We are living in a political world and even in the religious world, there is politics between God and Satan. We as Christians have chosen to be following God and his promises. You must be in one side because we are in a democratic world and there are consequences," Githae said. Githae said even in future, he will be supporting anyone who his heart will be attracted to. "For now, I have chosen to be a Jubilee campaigner because I stood with their policy. I will still stand with Uhuru to the end. Once he retires, I will again decide which side to support because it is my democratic right," he said. Declining to reveal how much he made from the song, he however said 'Tano Tena' was in his album and he expected no payment from the song. He just wanted to campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta. In 2011, when Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto were facing charges at the International Criminal Court, Githae used the song ‘Mabataro Makwa’ to show solidarity with UhuRuto. Ben Githae is currently ruling the airwaves with his new song titled 'Mwana wa Kahii' (Boy Child), which he says is a plea to the society to give equal opportunities to boys.
