Civil societies in Kisumu have said governors in the Lake Region Economic Bloc have done little to change the lives of their people. Pamoja Trust Executive Director Steve Ouma told the county governments to come up with clear mechanisms for spurring development to fulfill the dream of devolution. He noted that they were  deeply concerned that there is very little evidence of social transformation. He said the only possible exception is Kakamega county where there are reports of clear outcomes in developing feeder roads and healthcare. “We fear that unless the counties develop a clear mechanism for advancing change nothing much shall happen,” he said. He asked the governors to develop clear programmes     meant to empower youths and farmers besides the regional bank.     Transform Empowerment for Action initiative (TEAM) executive director George Owuor asked the  governors to prioritise on implementing development agenda in order to improve residents livelihoods.
