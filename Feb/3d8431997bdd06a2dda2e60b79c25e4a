A secondhand clothes dealer has been charged with stabbing his wife to death for allegedly threatening to leave him because he was poor. Paul Kimani denied stabbing Joyce Wairimu with a kitchen knife on January 8 at Masimba junction in Kayole. The mitumba seller appealed to Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga to be given lenient bond terms. He was freed on Sh500,000 bond. The couple had one child and lived separately. The court was told that Kimani visited his wife in Kayole on the material date. They talked and after dinner went to sleep. A quarrel ensued later after Wairimu allegedly threatened to leave him because she was unhappy living with relatives. Kimani is said to have left the house to buy rat poison and commit suicide. He returned to the house and consumed the poison before stabbing himself in the hand with a knife. When Wairimu tried to stop him he stabbed her in the abdomen. She screamed and relatives found her bleeding with the intestines protruding from her abdomen. They were both taken to Mama Lucy Hospital, where Wairimu was pronounced dead. The case will be heard on June 6. Click here for the latest political news
