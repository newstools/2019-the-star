Agriculture Cabinet Secretary wants tea farmers paid more for the green leaf, and has urged Kenya Tea Development Agency to increase the price of a kilo from Sh16 to Sh20. KTDA raised prices by a shilling from Sh15 last year but farmers are complaining that this is low compared to the billions of shillings the country earns for the produce. In 2018, farmers produced 1.2 billion kilos of green leaf and earned Sh62 billion. During a meeting with KTDA at Kilimo House, CS Mwangi Kiunjuri said farmers have also been complaining that the agency did not consult them before the one shilling increment. The price will be effective from next month. Kiunjuri directed KTDA to conduct a survey on prices within 60 days that will be implemented by July. “I have received a lot of memorandums from farmers complaining of low earnings despite good prices in the market. I give you two months to carry out the survey and involve all tea farmers in the country,” said the CS. KTDA chairman Peter Kanyago who was present during the meeting said they decided to increase the price to Sh16 due to inflation. According to KTDA, Kenya is the leading exporter of tea at 95 per cent while only five per cent is consumed locally. This, Kanyago said, greatly affects the market price which leads to low prices and hence low pay to farmers. The effect on the new pay will also be determined by the factory and region where each farmer comes from. The chairman also urged farmers to uproot old bushes and replace them with high yielding ones. The current bushes produce one to 1.5 kilos of green leaf per tree while the new variety yields three kilos per bush.
