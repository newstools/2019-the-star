Action is needed." @Oyaro Enock wrote," The best thing to assist here is Matiang'i to intervene, we are in danger now."  Police arrested the suspect who was photographed with a gun. /COURTESY In a photo that has been circulating on social media, the man is seen with a pistol at a garbage collecting site.
