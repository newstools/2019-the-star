A man freed by a Mandera court of sexual exploitation of a girl has been rearrested. This followed complaints by human rights activists that the case against Ibrahim Hassan had not been properly prosecuted. The case was withdrawn on February 6. Noor Abdow, the chairman of the Human Rights Network in Mandera, said a complainant has a right to re-file the suit if not satisfied with a court’s decision. Hassan was yesterday charged afresh with the offence. He denied the charges before Mandera resident magistrate Duncan Mtai. He was accused of transporting a 17-year-old girl  to Nairobi on January 9 for sexual exploitation and early marriage. He was arrested at Mandera airstrip in the company of the minor. The girls’ parents informed security personnel at the Mandera army barracks of the abduction before the suspect was arrested. Mtai released Hassan on a Sh500,000 bond with a surety in similar amount. The case will be mentioned on February 25. Child marriage is on the rise in Northeastern region where schoolgirls are married off for wealth.
