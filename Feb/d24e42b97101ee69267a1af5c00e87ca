The law setting operating hours of bars in Embu is causing alcohol abuse and hurtring projectivity, the county commissioner has said. Embu County Commissioner Abdullahi Galgalo says health and safety are compromised because bars open from 2pm and close at 5pm. This is as per the law that was passed by the county assembly some years back. The law contradicts the national one on alcohol control which states that bars should open from 5pm to 11pm. He said some people start drinking too early. Galgalo said he will talk to the county government to ensure the law is harmonised with the national. “I am new herer and I can’t work effectively for the local people alone,” Galgalo said. He was speaking during the launch of the National Integrated Management System program in Embu.
