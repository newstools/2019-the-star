Activist Caroline Mwatha died from excessive bleeding caused by a possible abortion, an independent pathologist has said. Details of the state of her womb revealed that the foetus was extremely dismembered while her uterus was raptured. A postmortem was done on the body at Umash Funeral Home, Nairobi, on Thursday.  It was led by Dr Peter Ndegwa and witnessed by a number of doctors representing the family, the Dandora Community Social Justice Centre and Haki Africa. “The uterus was raptured, causing more than a litre of blood to flow into the abdomen. The arms and the legs of the foetus are damaged,” Ndegwa said. He added that the head of the foetus is partly damaged and the body is pale white, signifying an excessive loss of blood. Caroline's husband Joshua Ochieng was 'surprised and deflated' by the outcome of the autopsy results. His family wants Caroline's body and that of the foetus to be preserved and carried in separate caskets. A DNA test will be done on the foetus and Caroline's body parts that were found to have needle marks will be sampled for toxicology analysis to determine the drug or chemical that was administered. The autopsy report appears to confirm the DCI's claims on Tuesday that Caroline died while undergoing an abortion at a backstreet clinic in Dandora Phase 1. Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti said the failed abortion was conducted at New Njiru Community Centre by one "Dr" Michael Onchiri alias Dr Mike and the owner of the clinic Betty Akinyi Nyanya alias Betty Ramoya. "Investigators believe that Caroline died in the clinic and the body was transferred to the Nairobi City Mortuary on February 7 at 4:42 am," Kinoti said. Click here for the latest political news
