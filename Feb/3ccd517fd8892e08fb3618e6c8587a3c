Nyeri town handcart pushers, known as beba beba, have introduced green dustcoat uniforms and job IDs to weed out criminals and improve their image. They have registered a self-help group for their welfare and plan to start a big income- generating venture and a sacco. This step is expected to help redeem their image, provide easy identification and improve the trade. The mention of beba beba brings to mind images of people who rarely bathe, who are drunkards, drug abusers, thieves and other criminal elements. Their secretary, John Mwangi, on Tuesday said they want to change this narrative. He spoke during a regular meeting in Nyeri town. Mwangi said their members have fallen victim to security officers’ raids as police believe criminals hide among them. They want to change this mentality, he said. The police, he said, have been having problems differentiating between genuine beba bebas and criminals. “We decided to form a self-help group to look into our welfare, provide green dustcoats and job identity cards for easy identification by security officers and customers,” he said. More than 70 members have joined the group. Members will be vetted to ensure they have no criminal records.  No one will be allowed to operate without the uniform and the card, Mwangi said. Chairman Nicholas Warui said many people exploit beba bebas and pay them peanuts.
