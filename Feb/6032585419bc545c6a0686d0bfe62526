Nakuru MCAs have opposed the 2019/2020 budget public participation forums that were scheduled to begin on Tuesday across 11 sub counties saying the process lacks transparency. The members argue that the 20 million allocated for projects in each of the 55 wards is illegal as the formula used is contrary to the County Revenue Allocation Act of 2018. Earlier on Monday, the MCAs summoned Finance CEC Joseph Kiuna to clarify the legal basis for the ongoing public participation forums. Kiuna said the misunderstanding emerged from a lack of a fiscal strategy paper that would put a ceiling on the allocations for each of the 55 wards. Addressing media after the meeting at the assembly, the MCAs led by Deputy Speaker Samuel Tonui, termed the exercise illegal. “The executive had approached the electorates with slashed allocations against what was agreed upon during the budget-making process and that is why we are disputing the public participation,” he said. Tonui said it was wrong for the executive to hold public participation forums twice during the same financial year yet the proposals made during the first forums were yet to be implemented. “A year down the line the county has nothing to show on physical projects. The delay has made the ground hostile for the members as the electorates demand projects," Stanley Karanja, Naivasha East MCA, said. Dundori MCA Michael Chege accused the county treasury of misleading Governor Lee Kinyanjui into participating in illegalities. Click here for the latest political news
