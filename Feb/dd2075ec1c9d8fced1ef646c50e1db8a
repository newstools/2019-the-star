Residents of Bangladesh slum in Mombasa county want a contractor to
speed up the construction of a flyover near their area to reduce accidents. On Thursday, a 34-year-old man was knocked down by
a trailer and left for dead. Ndune Mwachiro was crossing the road after
alighting from a matatu from work when he was hit. “I happened to be passing the area when I saw many
people. Upon inquiry I learnt that someone had been knocked down and was unconscious.
I quickly mobilised people and we rushed him to Coast General hospital,” Haki Africa rapid response officer Mathias Shipeta said on Friday. Mwachiro was admitted at the Pandya Memorial Hospital after being transferred from Coast General Hospital. He suffered severe head injuries and had to be taken to the ICU, his wife Lilian Owuor said. Shipeta said the incident was the sixth case in three
months. The road,which is part of the Mombasa-Nairobi highway, had
speed bumps but they were removed when
construction of the flyover began mid-last year. Residents say it is taking too long and they fear
many people could get killed. “So far, we have not received any report of deaths
but those who have been knocked down have serious injuries. Others are maimed,”
Shipeta said. “The government needs to put pressure on the
contractor to complete the construction of the flyover sooner rather than
later." In 2016, then Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar led Bangladesh residents in protesting against the rising number of accidents on that section of
the road. The Kenya National Highways Authority
officers visited the scene and installed speed bumps. Click here for the latest political news
