Back in June 2014, then Nakuru Governor, Kinuthia Mbugua, directed that illegal structures built on parking lots and road reserved areas be demolished. The governor defended his directive by saying that he was not targeting traders but he is only trying to decongest the Central Business District area of Nakuru town. Kinuthia's statement came a day after violent demonstrations and street riots hit parts of Nakuru town following the demolition of structures around Afraha Stadium.
