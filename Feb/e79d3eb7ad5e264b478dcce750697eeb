An Embu policeman was charged on Friday with kissing and cuddling a 15-year-old girl in a cell. Constable Lobolia Tobias denied sexually assaulting the minor before Embu senior resident magistrate Antony Kwambai. The officer is attached to Manyatta police station in Embu West. He was accused of touching the girl’s breasts on January 16 at Manyatta police station. “He took advantage of his position as police officer to sexually assault the girl by kissing and touching her breasts,” the charge reads. The prosecution said Tobias kept visiting the cell where the Form 2 student was held. The girl is said to have sought refuge at the police station after quarrelling with her mother. The mother chased her away with a kitchen knife. She was booked as child in need of care. After being put in custody, the officer realised that other remandees had left the cell and took advantage by pushing the girl against the wall and sexually assaulting her, the prosecution said. When she was produced before magistrate Jean Ndegeri a week ago, the girl said she was sexually assaulted by a police officer. The magistrate ordered investigations. Manyatta police station boss Samson Mukura led the investigation. He ordered all officers out on parade for the girl to identify who assaulted her. Tobias was released on Sh50,000 bond with surety in similar amount. He could post a Sh35,000 bail. The case is scheduled for pre-trial on February 6.
