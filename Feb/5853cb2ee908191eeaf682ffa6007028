Kenya’s youngest MP John Mwirigi has threatened a journalist over his story about residents’ claims that he is no longer in touch with them. During the last polls, Mwirigi, 24, beat the odds to emerge victorious as an independent candidate. He had campaigned on a bicycle — sometimes on foot. Residents expected he would remain down-to-earth and help them fix their problems. Many of them are complaining. They accuse Mwirigi of ignoring their plight. Koome Kimenchu of Royal Media Services had covered their complaints. On Saturday, Mwirigi was angry. He lashed out at Kimenchu for working at the behest of “my rivals”. Yesterday, efforts to get clarification from him were unsuccessful. He did not return calls. Mwirigi is no stranger to controversies. On November 26 last year, he was arrested for pushing away a police barrier at Mikinduri, Tigania East. On April 30, he was accused of physically assaulting a man for allegedly leading a demo over the poor state of a constituency road. John Gikunda, known as Wanugu, said the lawmaker manhandled him and squeezed his neck. The MP accused him of having a private agenda to tarnish his name, he said. At the Saturday event attended by Trade CS Peter Munya, residents aired their frustrations. They were outraged that the MP is allegedly intolerant of criticisms. One asked the legislator why he had pitched tent in Nairobi. “Are you looking for a wife? What are you up to in Nairobi?” he asked. Mwirigi dismissed the question, saying he visits the constituency every weekend to work for the people. Munya urged Mwirigi to focus on development. “When I was elected, I wasn’t married too, but I didn’t lose focus.”
