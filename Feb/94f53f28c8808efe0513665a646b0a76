A witness in the hearing of NYS Cluster Three yesterday was stood down because the prosecution had not supplied the defence team with documentary evidence they need. Joyce Nyamosi, an assistant director of the supplies chain at the Department of Public Works, was stood down after lawyer Stephen Ligunya realised they were not supplied with the documents she was relating to during the cross-examination. “Let the state supply us with all the documents they intend to rely on, including minutes of the twentieth Ministerial Tender Committee meeting held on March 18 and April 19, 2011,” he said. But Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Mercy Gateru urged the court to dismiss the application and order they proceed with the cross-examination. In a brief ruling, magistrate Lucas Onyina said it is in the interest of fairness that the defence is supplied with the documents. Nyamosi was stood down until further hearing on February 18. The NYS Cluster Three involves former PS Lillian Omollo, National Youth Service director General Richard Ndubai and 36 others. They allegedly conspired to defraud the NYS of Sh167,535,700. The offence was committed between April 2016 and May 2017. Read: Court rejects defence plea for adjournment of NYS case Click here for the latest political news
