Police officers, traders and farmers are part of a livestock theft racket in Nyandarua, county commissioner Boaz Cherutich said on Friday. He warned those involved that their days are numbered. Cherutich said they have established how the criminals operate. “This cartel has many players. Maybe there are some officers involved, businessmen and farmers, but we shall not be afraid. We shall go after them, whoever they are and wherever they are, because we must break this network,” he told journalists in his office. Six stolen cows were recovered on Thursday night at a Nyahururu abattoir. The suspected thief escaped. Police got a tip from wananchi. Residents had resolved at a meeting that no animal would be slaughtered at night. Cherutich said rustling has increased over the past three months.
