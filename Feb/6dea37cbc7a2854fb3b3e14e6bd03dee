Murang’a MCAs want the county to complete the Sh63 million expansion of Kirwara hospital in Gatanga. It has stalled for more than five years. In a report tabled by Health Services chairman Francis Githuka, the MCAs said the county started the project in 2014 but it stalled because of delayed payments to the contractor. The project was supposed to be completed in one year. The contractor, who was awarded the tender in 2014, said he left the site in 2016 because of non-payment by the county government. “By November last year, the contractor had been paid Sh27 million and is yet to be paid a balance of Sh11 million for the work done,” Githuka said. The building, Githuka said, was to create more space for improved services. It has all the facilities of a level 4 hospital, including a modern laboratory and X-ray machines. It lacks an incubator, incinerator, a functional laboratory, a morgue, a male ward and a dental unit. The maternity has no theatre beds. It has only one resident doctor.
