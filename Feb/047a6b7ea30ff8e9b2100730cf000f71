Embu Governor Martin Wambora and ward reps have been commended for reconciling after months of in-fighting. Former senate seat aspirant and contractor Munyi Mundigi said the fight between the executive and County Assembly had denied residents services with the Assembly refusing to pass supplementary budgets. Munyi called for the revival of stalled projects for the benefit of residents now that the disagreement is over. He asked both the executive and the legislature to iron out differences in future. “If the executive and the Assembly have seriously decided to work together as it has been reported, this is good. It is what we have been praying for.” The politician was reacting to media reports that Wambora and the MCAs met secretly in Nairobi on January 24 and ended their long-standing standoff. Wambora confirmed the meeting, saying they agreed to put their political differences aside and concentrate on fast-tracking development. “Let Kenyans know that we are not fighting now and that we shall be engaging in work for the benefit of the people,” the governor said.
