The Kenya Airports Authority needs to involve its employees in the planned privatisation deal with Kenya Airways, according to the International Air Transport Association. Under the proposed Privately Initiated Investment Proposal KQ plans to takeover operations at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. IATA vice president for Africa Raphael Kuuchi said dialogue will ensure job and business security at the airport. “The involved operators need to know what’s in place under the proposed PIIP to ensure businesses will not be disrupted and jobs will be secure,” he told the Star. Members of the Kenya Aviation Workers Union are today going on strike to boycott the proposal that KQ takes over airport operations. “We feel the takeover does not make business sense because KQ is a private entity and we as Kenyans will not have a stake in how the airport will be run,” Kawu secretary general Moses Ndiema told the Star. “The strike is still on.” Kawu has about 10,000 members including airport ground staff, cargo operators, flight attendants and other support service workers. Kuuchii said while it is not unusual for a national carrier to take charge of airport operations, the concerns being raised by workers and business operators are that the proposed PIIP could have negative competitive implications.
