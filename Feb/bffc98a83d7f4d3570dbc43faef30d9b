Environment CS Keriako Tobiko has directed that individuals, companies and public institutions discharging raw waste into Nairobi River be charged for the offence. The CS said on Friday that pollution of the rivers undermines the realisation of universal health and food security which is among President Uhuru Kenyatta's Big Four Agenda. Tobiko spoke when he visited Kirichwa Kubwa, Kinyanjui, Dagoretti, Kileleshwa and Westlands areas, where the river passes through. The CS's directive followed an inspection exercise where it was found that landlords and property owners in informal settlements empty raw sewage into the river instead of channelling it to the sewer line. Tobiko also inspected the ongoing cleanup of the river that involves removal of sludge, clearing of the banks, unblocking of waterways and reforestation. The project has engaged 600 youths on a casual basis. The 42km Nairobi river's source is in Kikuyu highlands. The river flows through Nairobi to Eastlands. The cleanup is part of an ongoing exercise aimed at restoring Nairobi city’s lost glory. Click here for the latest political news
