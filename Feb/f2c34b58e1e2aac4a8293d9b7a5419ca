Suspected contraband sugar worth almost Sh1 million was impounded by police in Garissa yesterday morning. The 360 bags of 25kg each believed to be from Somalia were to be sold in Garissa town, County Commissioner Meru Mwangi said. Mwangi alongside other security officers said the hunt for the owners of the consignment and the delivery vehicle was on. He spoke to the press after inspecting the consignment at the Garissa police station yesterday. A Probox that was in front of the lorry and which was believed to be carrying the owners of the consignment made a quick u-turn on seeing the police and sped off. Mwangi said the driver and the turn-boy are being held by the police as investigations on who the real owners of the consignment are and where they were destined for. “The owners of the consignment and the vehicle can run but they cannot hide. We will catch up with them soon. The good thing is that we already have the consignment,” Mwangi said. The commissioner said the state will not relent on its war on illicit goods that are denying the government revenue and also exposing Kenyans to health risks.
