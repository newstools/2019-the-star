The county government of Kiambu has extended the waiver period on all interest and penalties on land rates from January 21 to February 21, 2019. The defaulters are expected to pay the principle sum within the period given after which enforcement measures will be taken. Rate defaulters should note that the County Government has powers to recover all the outstanding rates plus accrued interest and/or penalties. It can also compel tenants of rate defaulters to pay rent directly to the county government until the rates and interests due are recovered fully. The county government may deny and/or decline to renew any licenses or permits sought by a rate defaulter. It may also withhold any development/approvals until outstanding rates are paid. Until outstanding rates are paid, the county government may withhold any development or approvals of defaulters. Defaulters can make payments in Kikuyu, Lari, Limuru, Thika, Gatundu North and South, Githunguri, Kabete, Kiambaa, Ruiru, Kiambu and Juja. Kiambu residents and MPs have opposed the increase in land rates. They criticised Governor Ferdinand Waititu’s administration for hiking parking fee in major towns—Kiambu, Kikuyu, Thika, Ruiru and Limuru. The county increased the fee by 100 per cent, from Sh50 to Sh100. During a meeting in Kiriko village, Gatundu North, the MPs faulted the county for overlooking public participation by implementing the “unlawful and improbable rates”.
