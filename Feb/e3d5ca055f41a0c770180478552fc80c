The water rationing programme for Nairobi residents will continue, Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company has said. Head of corporate affairs Mbaruku Vyakweli on Monday said due to the prevailing dry season, the rationing programme will be maintained as it has been. Vyakweli, however, dismissed fears that the rationing is likely to be rampant. He said rationing has always been there and there should be no cause for alarm as the current levels of water at Ndakaini Dam, though not enough, can push the city till next month when long rains are expected. "Currently we have about 68.5 per cent water levels at Ndakaini and we anticipate some short rains this month so that should be enough to push us for a few days," he said. Mbaruku said in January the levels had already dropped to 73.9 per cent compared to December when the levels were at 78.3 per cent. NWSC supply's the city with 505,000 cubic metres of water a day, against a demand of 760,000 cubic metres a day.
