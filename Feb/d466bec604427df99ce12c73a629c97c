International Justice Mission will on Monday hold a night vigil in honor of human rights defender who went missing on Wednesday last week. Caroline Mwatha disappeared from her home in Dandora under unclear circumstances. Her disappearance was reported on Friday at Buruburu police station. Mwatha is a founder member and caseworker with the Dandora Community Social Justice Centre which has been calling for police professionalism and an end to extrajudicial killings.

"The vigil will begin from 4 pm to 9 pm. Those interested should carry candles that will be lit during the night," they said via Facebook. In a statement on Sunday, Amnesty International Executive Director Irungu Houghton called on investigating agencies to move with speed and establish Mwatha’s whereabouts. Mwatha’s disappearance is quite sensitive considering the nature of advocacy activities she is involved with. Her disappearance evokes memories of the sad ending of the lives of human rights lawyer Willie Kimani, his client and a taxi driver. Click here for the latest political news
