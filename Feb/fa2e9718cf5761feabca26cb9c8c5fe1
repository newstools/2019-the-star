Fresh from bagging a paltry one point at the Sydney Sevens, Shujaa have been pitted against inform USA, France and Argentina in a tricky Pool ‘B’ for the Las Vegas Sevens next month. Kenya failed to win a match in Sydney, losing all five matches—24-14 to Canada, 41-0 to USA, 40-17 to France, 19-14 to Wales and 20- 17 to non-core side, Tonga Kenya will open their campaign at the sold out Sam Boyd Stadium to the hosts USA, followed thereafter by a tricky meeting against France. This will be the fourth meeting between Paul Murunga’s charges against the European outfit who qualified for the quarterfinals in Sydney. Kenya have only won once against France 19-15 in Hamilton. They have, however, lost three times 21-12 in Dubai, 19-12 in Cape Town and 40-17 in Sydney. Shujaa wrap up their preliminary round against Argentina.

Kenya lie 13th on the log with 12 points and arrive in the country today. Shujaa will have a one week break before resuming training on February 12 for the Las Vegas and Vancouver legs next month. The team will have a 10-day rest and recovery period. Head coach Murunga was adamant that there was room for improvement. “This was tough tournament performance wise. The boys gave it their all but the results were not good enough,” he added. Skipper Jacob Ojee said work needs to be done on ball retention, conditioning and efficiency in attack. “We have limited time in training but when we get home, I will try to work out things because I believe there are certain things we can do better,” added Ojee.
