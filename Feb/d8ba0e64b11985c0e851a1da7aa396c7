Gospel singer Willy Paul says he is not giving his heart to any woman. "I’m not in love, although I know how to compose love songs," he told Word Is on Tuesday. "Women are difficult to deal with. It is not me but life has taught me; I don't believe in love." This comes a few months after a woman identified as Mali said she is the mother of the singer's baby boy. She described herself as “always grateful” and “forever smiling”. Mali Queen even told slay queens and groupies to stay the (expletive) away from her man. “Yah’ll ladies he’s Fully taken and soon will be walking down the aisle with the Mother to his Most Adorable son #KingDamian…Keep away ladies don’t bring him temptations,” she wrote in a recent candid Instagram post. In the past, Willy Paul had also stated categorically what he thinks of marriage: “Marry a beautiful woman…gain praise from your friends. But cry every night in your own house.” Willy Paul has been in controversy many times because of the kind of music he is doing, which critics say is secular. "It is part of my talent to do such songs and it is not a sin. After all, God is love. There are people who still believe in love. Before you start throwing stones, remember you are alive as a result of love," he said. Willy Paul is promoting his two new songs, 'Harambee' and 'Bebi Bebi'. "Harambee is a song about a love life where you have a woman in life but you cannot afford to spoil her. So I am telling her, 'Nitafanya harambee because I have prominent people who will support me.' Then when I get money, I will spoil her," he said. "All my love songs are not about me. I do them because of the love my mum and my late dad had. It was genuine. Let love be love and I remain to be Willy Paul, but for now, I am only in love with God." Willy Paul will be spending his Valentine's with his mother because he says she is the only true love that he knows will never play with his heart.
