Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko will host this year's Good Deeds Day on April 7. "As the Ambassador of Good Deeds in Africa, I'll be hosting the Good Deeds Day on April 7 to promote good deeds in our society," he tweeted. He continued, "I'm appealing to other Kenyans to offer help to the less fortunate members of the society as a way of showing generosity." Last year, Sonko was named the Good Deeds Goodwill ambassador by Israel. The Israel delegation led by Good Deeds Global CEO Kaynan Rabino revealed this after paying Sonko a courtesy call at City Hall on December 2018. Rabino hailed the ongoing major beautification along Mombasa Road and also thanked the governor for his good support to various communities. He also added that Nairobi is a good city to invest in and do business. "We have been watching various videos on YouTube, you are a leader who should be emulated by many."

The baby's father was arrested on Sunday as he attempted to sneak out the baby hidden in a shopping bag to avoid paying the bill. After clearing the bill Sonko's team went to a supermarket where they generously shopped for the young family. The Governor also offered to give employment to the child's father.
