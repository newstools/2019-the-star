A conference about Roman Catholic priests and paedophilia has just ended in Rome. Pope Francis condemned child sexual abuse as ‘satanic’. Thank God he was honest enough to convene this conference with senior Catholics from 130 countries. The conference called Protection of Minors in the Church promised zero tolerance of abuse, mandatory codes of conduct for priests and training for people to spot abuse and inform police. These measures are positive but they won’t solve the problem because the root cause is celibacy. Celibacy cannot eliminate sexual urges. As a result, the sexuality of priests gets bottled up and emerges in unhealthy directions such as child abuse. The widespread gay culture inside the priesthood also becomes twisted because it is secretive and a taboo topic. The best way to eliminate sexual abuse in the church is to get rid of celibacy. Catholic priests could marry in the past and only in the last 1,000 years has celibacy been imposed on them. Let priests get married and live normal lives.
