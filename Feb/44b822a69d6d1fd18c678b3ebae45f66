Conflicts over grazing fields might recur this year because of pasture shortage. The latest forecast shows dwindling pastures in most of northern Kenya, where most people are pastoralists.“Food insecurity will be heightened among the poorest households as livestock increasingly migrate to dry season grazing areas. Increased resource–based conflict is also likely as livestock herders clash over rangeland resources,” the January -March prediction released by FewsNet says. The forecast March to May long rains will regenerate forage and water resources by mid-April and livestock are expected to return to wet season grazing areas, it says. FewsNet is a network of non-governmental organisations funded by the Usaid and receives input from Kenya’s Agriculture ministry. It says from April to May, livestock body conditions are expected to improve, leading to improved livestock value and milk productivity. “Yet these improvements would increase the likelihood for cattle raids,” it says. The report also predicts acute malnutrition in Mandera, Turkana and Samburu counties and in parts of Baringo and Marsabit, primarily driven by poor childcare feeding practices and limited access to health facilities.
