Kenya has begun investigating British music production company De Wolfe Limited over infringement on the national anthem. The Kenya Copyright Board yesterday said it is studying the terms and conditions on You Tube to find out if the company infringed on the anthem's copyright. "We'll request for all content offending the National Anthem by De Wolfe and others to be taken down," the board said in a statement yesterday. Kenya's National Anthem is over 50 years old and has fallen into public domain. That means it is no longer restricted. The length of time for which a copyright work is protected depends on the category or type of music. Copyrights for sound recordings such as National Anthem lasts 50 years. For literary, musical or artistic work other than photographs, copyright lasts for the period of the life of the author plus 50 years. Audio-visual works and photographs lasts 50 years from the end of the year in which the work was either made, first made available to the public, or first published, whichever date is the latest. The board however said Kenya's Anthem was still being protected given its significance. "Given the place of National Anthem in any country and the provisions of the National Flags, Emblems and Names Act, there is additional protection of the anthem against misuse and improper use."
