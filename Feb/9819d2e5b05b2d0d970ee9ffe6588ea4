The Supreme Court hasÂ upheld the election of Laikipia Governor Nderitu Mureithi and dismissed the appeal lodged against him. While dismissing the case on Friday, the judges said that the issue brought before them should have been handled by the disputes tribunal. Nderitu's Challenger had argued that the governor should not have been cleared to contest because he switched camp days to the election. The court also upheld the election of Shinyalu MP Justus Kizito saying that they saw no reason to overturn the decision of the Court of Appeal. The petitioner Sylverse Anami cannot be allowed to use the Supreme Court to review the IEBC decision which had found that Justus Gezito Mogali and Justus Kizito are one and the same person. Anami had argued that ODM cleared a different person under a different name in the register. Click here for the latest political news
