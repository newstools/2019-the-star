Muslim clerics in Lamu have protested the increasing trend by the national and county governments to hold official functions on Fridays which is their official day of worship. Majority of Lamu locals are Muslims who strictly adhere to their religious practices. They said the events have been disrupting their prayer schedules. Last Friday, Water CS Simon Chelugui was in Lamu to launch water projects in various parts of the county. Two weeks ago, government officials led by the Secretary of Administration in the State Department of Public Works Stephen Ikua was in the area to officially commission the Sh671 million construction and rehabilitation of jetties on a Friday. Imams and Sheikhs in the county are now accusing the national and county governments of trading their day of worship for ‘worldly functions’ a move they said is in contravention of Islamic teachings and doctrines. Speaking on Wednesday, Interfaith Council of Clerics - CICC chairperson Lamu branch Mohamed Abdulkadir said the trend was evidence that the national government was deliberately trying to shut out worship in the region by having events on Fridays. “Who doesn’t know that Fridays is our day of prayer? How then do we have official functions being held every single Friday? Don't they want locals to attend these functions?” said Abdulkadir. The chairperson of the Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya-CIPK Lamu branch Abubakar Shekuwe, however, said official events that have to be held on Fridays have to factor in time so as to ensure the prayer schedules of locals aren’t interfered with. “We just don’t want events on Fridays but if they just happen, then let them try morning hours so that the rest of the day serves its purpose. But generally, we need Fridays left alone,” said Shekuwe. Lamu elders said they will sensitise members of the public to snub all official events held on Fridays.
