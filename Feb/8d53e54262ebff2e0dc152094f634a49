Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong yesterday threatened to lead a demonstration in protest against Kenha’s failure to expand and repair the dilapidated Busia-Kisumu Northern Corridor B road. The governor said he has written many letters to have the road expanded and repaired. The road links Kenya and the Great Lakes region. Ojaamong said residents have been accusing his administration of failing to expand the road, yet it is the responsibility of the national government. “This is an international road with the county government having no mandate to carry any repairs on it. The British government donated Sh200 million towards the dualisation of the road from the border to Korinda and they should have started,” Ojaamong said in his office.
