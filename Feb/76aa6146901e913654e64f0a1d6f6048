The dream of having two desalination plants in Mombasa will soon be realised because of our work, MCAs said on Tuesday. The ward reps are claiming credit for the soon-to-be established water desalination plants in Likoni and Shanzu and the newly launched e-parking system. They were responding to accusations that they are dormant, “100 per cent Joho’s rubber stamps” and that they have nothing to show the electorate. Last week, former MCAs Riziki Fundi and Jabess Oduor said the current assembly is worse than that of their time. The first county assembly also had struggled to shake of the “rubber stamp” tag. On Tuesday, nominated MCAs Milka Moraa and Fatma Kushe said those who choose to be blind will not see anything they do. “Let them talk. We do not want publicity. We will only work for the Mombasa residents,” said Kushe. Moraa said: “We have just launched the e-parking system and this is the only county that has done that. Mombasa is on the move.” “Now we are doing the water desalination project. What are you saying? That is our project right from inside,” Maraa said. On Wednesday, Water executive Fatma Awale said they are finalising the finances to break the ground for the two desalination plants. “By June, we should have done the ground-breaking,” Awale said on the phone.
