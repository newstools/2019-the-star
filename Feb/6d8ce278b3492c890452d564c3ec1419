A German national was on Thursday arraigned in a Malindi court charged with sexually assaulting an 8-year-old girl. Karl Hein Otto, 70, however, denied the charges when he appeared before Malindi Chief Magistrate Julie Oseko. Hein was accused of inserting his fingers in the minor’s private parts on February 2 at Majengo area in Malindi subcounty. The second count stated that on the same day he inserted a plastic spoon in the girl’s private parts. Prosecuting counsel Alice Mathangani opposed the accused’s release on bail saying he was a flight risk. His lawyer, however, told the court that Hein had all the necessary documents including a passport and requested that he be allowed to pick them from his residence. The Chief Magistrate ordered the accused to be remanded at Malindi police station until next Monday when she will rule on his bail application. Click here for the latest political news
