Six houses belonging to an elderly man accused by Ndhiwa residents of protecting a killer crocodile in River Kuja have been torched. The Rachong villagers in Kabuoch claimed Gabriel Osaso, 79, uses the animal to practise witchcraft. On Friday, the crocodile allegedly attacked and killed Standard 1 pupil Veronica Achieng’ as she was crossed the river from Ombo Primary School. Osaso is said to have gone to where some divers and villagers were searching for the girl’s body and told them not to kill the reptile. Asked why the crocodile should not be killed, the old man allegedly refused to respond. “Osaso threatened to deal with people who could try to kill the reptile. Angry residents roughed him up and linked him with the death of the pupil,” a witness said. The old man allegedly said the crocodile had swallowed the body so there was no need for the search. Yesterday, chief Joseph Ogur said Osaso was almost lynched but police officers rescued him. He was stoned and hit with other objects. “The residents turned angry because of his utterances and threats,” Ogur said. On Friday evening, more than 300 residents marched to his home and set the  houses ablaze. “They also burnt down the mzee’s maize and sugarcane plantations,” Ogur said. His 42-year-old son Peter was also injured and was admitted to a nearby hospital. More officers were deployed to  defuse tension and protect the family’s remaining properties. Osaso was taken to Ndhiwa police station for questioning. “We don’t want to lose any life or damage property. Police are on the ground to deal with any eventuality,” police boss Dishon Chadaka said. By yesterday, the search for the body was underway. Click here for the latest political news
