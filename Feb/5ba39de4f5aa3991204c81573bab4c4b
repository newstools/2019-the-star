A city restaurant broke the lover’s day culture of February 14, by hosting orphans and vulnerable children from Kayole’s Vessel of Hope School for a brunch. “It is not only our way of sharing love with the less fortunate, but also a moment when I get to spend time with children and motivate them to believe in themselves,” said Obado Obadoh, owner, Café Deli. Obadoh said, he decided to turn a day that normally gives the restaurant big sales into a day that creates a great impact to the society. “Sales are higher than other days, but the impact made surpasses everything.”
