The sunny weather being experienced in most parts of the country will persist for the next five days, the meteorological department has said. Temperatures will hit a high of 27 degrees in Nairobi and up to 38 degrees in Mandera. In Wajir and Garissa, temperatures will reach highs of 37 and 36 degrees, respectively. In a statement signed by the acting director of the Kenya Meteorological Department Stella Aura, the weatherman indicates the Coastal strip will experience sunny weather of between 23 to 33 degrees. The five-day forecast, however, says that Central, Lake and South Rift Valley regions will receive light rains in the afternoon to enhanced rainfall in the evening. "There will be a possibility of wildfires in areas with dry vegetation and strong winds like Lodwar and Marsabit," the statement said. On February 13, a report by the National Drought Management Authority showed that drought is worsening across 13 counties owing to the prevailing hot weather conditions across the country.
