Meru Deputy Governor Titus Ntochiu has warned against inciting traders not to pay levies. He dismissed claims that the county has increased the amount paid for licences. “We’re using the 2014 Act. We are yet to revise, so people should not incite traders to hold demonstrations,” Ntochiu said. On Tuesday, Nkubu town traders held protests against alleged increase of licence fees. They disrupted business and transport for several hours. The protesters accused the county government of demanding more money but providing poor services. But Ntochiu, who is also the Finance executive, dismissed the allegations. He said those inciting the traders are interested in handouts. “They make a lot of noise during the day but at night make attempts to extort money from us through bothersome phone calls and messages. They request us to ‘buy’ their silence. We want to assure them that no amount of intimidation, threats or riots will slow us down from the goal of ensuring taxpayers’ money is used to bring equitable development to all,” he said. The deputy county chief promised to harmonise charges in all towns and trading centres. On Sunday, MCAs Ruth Kananu (nominated), George Muthuri (Maua) and a former MCA clashed over the levies.
