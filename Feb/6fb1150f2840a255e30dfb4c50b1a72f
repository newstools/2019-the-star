Three more peanut butter brands have been found unfit for human consumption. This comes three days after the government warned that Nuteez peanut butter is toxic. The three, namely; Mother Nature, Clover Nuts smooth and Clover Nuts chocolate were found to have exceeded the maximum limit of aflatoxins. While the Kenya standard for peanut specification limits maximum total aflatoxin content to 15 parts per billion, the three brands had levels reaching 27.26 ppb, 36.44 ppb, and 44.25 ppb respectively. In a statement to the public released yesterday, Kenya Bureau of Standards said they have suspended permits for the three firms. “Manufacturers whose products have been suspended are instructed to discontinue the manufacturing or offering for sale all substandard peanut butter,” KEBS said The bureau further insisted that the manufacturers should recall all the substandard product and institute corrective actions. Last week, a certificate of analysis by the Interior ministry revealed that Nuteez peanut butter failed to pass test analysis conducted on a sample taken to the government chemist. Yesterday, KEBS confirmed to have seized all the peanut butter at Jetlak foods limited. “ Tests undertaken on the samples have confirmed that the levels of aflatoxin is 25.13 ppb which is higher than the maximum limit allowed by the Standard,” KEBS acting managing director Bernard Nguyo said. Consequently, Nguyo said that the Bureau has suspended the permit to the company that allows it to use the Standardization mark for its Nuteez brand. The firm has also been directed to recall all the products in the market. International Livestock Research Institute notes that aflatoxins are toxic chemicals produced as by-products by fungi that grow on maize, cottonseed, groundnuts, and other food crops. Exposure to aflatoxins is associated with an increased risk of liver cancer.
