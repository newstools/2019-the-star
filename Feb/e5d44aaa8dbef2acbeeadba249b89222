World-renowned Bass-thumper Marcus Miller says music is very important to him, as it can change people's lives. "I started realising that you can change the world through music when I found myself doing music," Marcus said during a press briefing yesterday. The two-time Grammy award winner will make his first Kenyan debut as the main attraction of this year’s Safaricom Jazz festival. He will be performing on Sunday at Kasarani Stadium with his iconic bass sound. Jazz Festival aims to help vulnerable youth from poor neighbourhoods and impoverished communities through music. Safaricom chief customer officer Sylvia Mulinge said: "We have this event because of the children who are expecting their lives will be transformed from the streets by your support."
