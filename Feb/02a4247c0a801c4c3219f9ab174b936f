Sauti Sol have spoken out on the ownership of their brand name amid rumours there was a businessman behind it. The allegations arose after they opened a record label called Sol Generation. "We are main stakeholders of the name Sauti Sol," Bien told Word Is on Tuesday. "We own the title since the beginning in 2005, and now we have Sol Production, which we are financing using our own savings." The label will, however, get some partners. Sol Generation aims to mentor other artistes. "We did not want our record label to be named after us because we want our signees to feel the energy of something new," Bien said. The boy band was formed in 2005 in Nairobi by the vocalists Willis Chimano, Bien-Aime Baraza, and Savara Mudigi. The band was initially an acapella group and the guitarist, Polycarp Otieno, had been a member of the band before they altered the group name to Sauti.
