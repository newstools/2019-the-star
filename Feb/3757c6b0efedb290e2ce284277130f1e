The Public Accounts Committee will soon release a "damning" report on the conduct and expenditures of IEBC in the 2017 general elections, Chairman Opiyo Wandayi has said. Wandayi differed with DP William Ruto who last week commended the electoral body for conducting the last general elections as per everyone's expectations. He said Ruto's sentiments should not be considered by anyone as there is "more than meets the eye". "We are going to expose the rot in IEBC as soon as the house resumes this week," he said. He hinted that mismanagement and extravagant spending by the IEBC triggered the PAC to vigorously investigate the body from last year. "The investigations majorly dealt with the expenditure of IEBC during the last general elections and the glaring lapses in the last general elections," Wandayi said. Wandayi said IEBC is to be blamed for any misfortunes in the previous general elections for not conducting a free and fair elections dispute being fully funded. Addressing residents in Ugunja on Sunday, Wandayi said he will not argue with the deputy president over the IEBC's mess during the last general elections but release a report about the rot in the commission. Wandayi said all along, the Public Accounts Committee has been investigating the electoral body and the report is not appealing for the DP to defend the electoral body. "On February 25, my committee is going to release a report on IEBC and that report will supercede all reports that have ever been written about IEBC," Wandayi said. The Ugunja lawmaker told IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati to hold all his plans of revitalising the IEBC until the committee tables it's findings in the floor of the house. "Chebukati should hold his horse and adapt the reports' findings for the betterment of his tenure in office," Wandayi said. Wandayi said the report will give the way forward for the IEBC and perhaps the management of elections in the country. Click here for the latest political news.
