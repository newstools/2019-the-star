Interior PS Karanja Kibicho will on Monday launch the Huduma Namba’s National Integrated Identity Management Systems pilot programme at the ACK Nyandarua Faith Academy. If a person is not registered in the system, once it becomes operational, he or she will get government services, an ID, passport, driving licence or a birth certificate. NIIMS, which will capture data for persons from the age of six, will create and manage a central master population register. Each NIIMS registration will generate a unique number to be known as a Huduma Namba whose purpose will be to assign a personal unique identification to facilitate government services after capturing biometric data of all citizens and foreigners. The system will be the authentic source of identity of all persons residing in Kenya including foreigners, Kibicho said. It is a mandatory national programme for registration of all Kenyan citizens and foreign nationals in the country The pilot registration that will run for a month will be done in 15 counties including Nairobi, Uasin Gishu, Kajiado, Baringo, Marsabit, Embu, Makueni, Busia, Nyandarua, Kiambu, Kilifi and Tana River.
