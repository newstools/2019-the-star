A number of people have been killed and injured in a stampede at a campaign rally for Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, local officials say. The incident happened at a stadium in the southern city of Port Harcourt when the crowd surged towards a gate after President Buhari's speech. Nigeria holds an election on Saturday in which Mr Buhari is running for his second term. Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar is seen as Mr Buhari's main contender. The incident happened after President Buhari delivered his speech shortly after 15:00 local time (14:00 GMT) at the Adokiye Amiesimaka stadium, local media report. Most of the victims are reported to have fallen and been trampled as the crowd tried to force its way through a partially locked gate to follow Mr Buhari as he left the arena. Injured people were taken to a nearby hospital. Mr Buhari's office later said that the president had been informed about "the tragic deaths of several members of his All Progressives Congress (APC) party in a stampede".
