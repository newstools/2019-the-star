Police in Murang’a town have arrested four people suspected to be behind an upsurge of car break-ins in the town. According to Murang’a County Criminal Investigations officer Julius Rutere, the four suspects including three women and a man were arrested on Wednesday evening after two people reported that their vehicles had been broken into outside a hotel. Rutere said the two victims got out of the hotel to find their personal wares they had left in their cars stolen. “The two who were driving a double cabin and a Toyota Vitz lost mobile phones, necklaces and radio faceplates all worth Sh30,000,” Rutere said. The victims reported the matter to Murang’a police station and a search was immediately launched for the suspects. Rutere said the four suspects; Joseph Kuria, Rosalina Mwihaki, Jane Muthoni and Rose Kihato were captured on CCTV camera opening the two vehicles using a master key. He said it took about 15 minutes for the suspects to open the two cars and steal from them after which they immediately left the hotel. The police managed to track down the Toyota Fielder that the suspects were driving at Kasarani area in Nairobi. The car had been hired from a car-hire in Nairobi, he added. The police boss, however, said the stolen items, have not been recovered and the vehicle has been detained at Murang’a police station as investigations continue. Rutere said the four suspects who are all middle-age will be charged with stealing from parked motor vehicles. He noted that there has been an increase of break-ins of cars parked outside main hotels in Murang’a town, with the culprits stealing even spare wheels. Click here for the latest political news.
