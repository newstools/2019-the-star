A man suspected to have killed his estranged wife in a lodging has been detained for eight days pending investigations. Emmanuel Owuor is suspected to have killed Grace Adhiambo. They had separated for some time and were trying to reconcile. Investigating officer Joseph Wanjohi told the court that Owuor booked a room at GNK Hamza Hotel Lodge along Jogoo Road on February 7 and invited Adhiambo to meet him there. The woman checked in, but she did not leave. Otieno allegedly ran away after he discovered his wife had died. Police said Owour was arrested last Friday. Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga asked the suspect if he had an objection to the application and he pleaded to be released. “Please release me because I’m hurting too. My wife is dead. I did not kill her because she had hypertension and she just collapsed in the room,” Owour said. The suspect has been remanded at Buruburu police station. The case will be mentioned on February 22.
