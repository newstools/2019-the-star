Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu’s administration says it has rehabilitated 5,200 alcoholics and drug addicts since its programme started a year ago. The Kaa Sober initiative ended yesterday and beneficiaries were given Sh20,000 each. It was launched in Makwa village, Gatundu North, where illicit brews were being sold in large scale and many consumers had lost their lives. Some county leaders opposed it but the governor pressed on. A group of residents graduated under the programme in December. The rest graduated yesterday in Ndumberi Grounds, Kiambu constituency. Last November, they were enrolled for short courses in polytechnics across the county. They underwent three-month training in masonry, plumbing, bakery, beadwork, tailoring, electrical installations, hairdressing and welding, among others. “While campaigning, we could see many youths drunk. I saw it as a problem and decided to deal with it. I used money to rehabilitate them and show them a way to fend for themselves by giving them trainings in short courses,” Waititu said, adding the county will create ‘Jijenge Fund’ so they get business loans.
