Eldoret residents have protested the escape of three murder suspects from Uasin Gishu county government cells on Friday. The three were  freed by mistake and are still at large. Eldoret South OCPD Wilson Abduba says the suspects were mixed up with the petty offenders who were being transferred from Langas police station to the county courts. The three had been arrested for allegedly killing a boda boda rider at Kipkenyo in the town. Three walked to freedom unnoticed when the county released the petty offenders. Abduba said CID officers were still searching for them. “Action had been taken against the officer at Langas police station who caused the mix-up leading to the release of the murder suspects,” Abduba said. Sources said the officer who was in charge at the police station during the incident has been interdicted. Residents of Kipkaren Saturday protested and marched to the police station demanding that the  OCS in charge of the station be transferred. However Abduba said its was not the fault of the OCS , but a junior officer who had no authority to release suspects held in cells. “The OCS did not order for the release and we have already taken action against the officer who did the mix up,” Abduba said. The pictures of the murder suspects have already been circulated and police were making efforts to ensure they are arrested and taken back to court. Uasin Gishu County Commissioner Abdi Hassan said the county security team had instructed police to ensure that the suspects are brought back to face the law. “We urge residents to be calm because they will be arrested to face the law,” Hassan said.
