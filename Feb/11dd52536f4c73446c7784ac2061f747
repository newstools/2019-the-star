Three senior officials accused of defrauding the Nairobi County Government of more than Sh7.3 million have been ordered to be reporting to the DCI until March 5. Chief finance officer Stephen Mwina Mutua, his deputy Johnson Abwori and accountant David Wambugu appeared before Milimani senior principal magistrate Peter Ooko on Tuesday. They were ordered to deposit Sh200,000 cash bail pending investigations. This after the court dismissed an application by the prosecution to have them detained for five days after detectives said the had not tabled compelling reasons to warrant their detention. In an affidavit filed in court by Inspector Wilson Mwita, who is attached to the Criminal Investigations Department at City Hall,  he said that he is probing conspiracy to defraud. The suspects were arrested on February 26 following a complaint that they conspired with the directors of M/s Nunguni General Supplies to defraud the county of Sh7,396,552. The DPP informed the court that investigations are yet to be completed and the investigating officer intends to prefer charges against the suspects depending on the outcome of the probe. The court further heard that the State required more time to record statements. The case will be mentioned on March 5. Click here for the latest political news
