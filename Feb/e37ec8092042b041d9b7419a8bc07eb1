Four people were arrested yesterday in Machakos for allegedly diverting medicines meant for public hospitals to private chemists. The county administration had complained that patients were being referred to private facilities to buy drugs, yet it had stocked its hospitals.Residents had raised concerns and demanded action. DCI officers arrested the four at a clinic opposite the Machakos Level 5 Hospital. Drugs, X-ray films, reagents and equipment emblazoned with government batch numbers and labels were seized. Governor Alfred Mutua said he notified the Directorate of Criminal Investigations last week. The county referral facility had been losing drugs and supplies through theft, he said. He wants all clinics in the county investigated. “It’s a common trend for patients to be referred to specific pharmacies and laboratories adjacent to the hospital for tests and drugs after being told that our hospitals lack drugs, “ Mutua said. The county chief ordered the suspension of all security officers at the county hospital, pending completion of investigations. He also called for a crackdown on quacks operating clinics in the region, saying they endangered residents’ lives. The governor later made an impromptu visit to the hospital’s laboratory to assess its operations and equipment. Click here for the latest political news
