Jamaica's Morgan Heritage member Una Morgan expressed her gratitude after she was informed that Murang’a Senator had named his child after her. “I am so humbled by this. I’m grateful my family could have a positive impact on people’s lives and families. I cannot wait to meet her,” Una Morgan tweeted. Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata had revealed in an interview with Word Is that he is a great fan of Morgan Heritage and he named his son after the popular Jamaican reggae group. “I named my second child, Euna Morgan," he said, "Morgan Heritage’s songs really inspire people because they highlight challenges people go through in life. Issues like why the youth in the ghetto don’t get the education like those in urban areas among other real-life issues.” The lawmaker also narrated how his love for reggae music saw him become a DJ in his campus days.
