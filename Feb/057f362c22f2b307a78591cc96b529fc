An Embu executive has warned residents against carrying out the wishes of their dead mothers who supported FGM. Some women have been secretly backing FGM in keeping with the dying wishes of their mothers. They fear they will be dogged by misfortunes if they fail to have their daughters mutilated. But Gender, Culture, Children and Social Services boss Joan Mwende said on Thursday that the rite of passage is backward, no longer justifiable and must be fought by everyone. “We’re in a modern world where Christianity and other religions reign and curses don’t work,” she said. “No curse can befall a parent if she doesn’t have her daughter circumcised. Such traditions are outdated. Women in Embu should not use that excuse to have their daughters face FGM,” Separately, Maendeleo ya Wanawake Orgnaisation Embu branch called for prosecution of parents whose girls are mutilated. Chairperson Mary Kavinda said a precedent has been set by Runyenjes senior resident magistrate Beatrice Kimemia. Last December, Kimemia sentenced a couple to seven years in prison for subjecting their daughter to FGM. Sammy Nyaga, his wife Irene Kinyua, the girl’s grandmother Nizareta Rwamba and circumciser Mercy Munyi were convicted on December 11. The 15-year-old girl said her parents tricked her into undergoing circumcision on December 2 in Kigaa village, Embu East. Kavinda urged Woman Representative Jane Wanjuki to use the affirmative action funds to fight FGM. Nominated MCA Edna Muisyo urged parents to protect their girls and value their education.
