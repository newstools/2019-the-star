The Ministry of Education on Tuesday announced plans to roll out the new Grade 4 curriculum in 2020. Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang said on Tuesday the designs for the grade have been approved and are undergoing final editing at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development. Kipsang was responding to questions from members of the National Assembly's Committee on Education on the progress of the new competency-based curriculum. "We have started final interpretation of the design and KICD is finalising on teachers' book guide," he said. The PS said the books will be availed by August before KICD undertakes a review on teacher training manuals.

This grade involves more than one teacher and has a lot of technicalities that need keen observation," he said. He said designs for grades 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 will be finalised before the end of the year. "As we speak, we have been undertaking classroom observation to see how teachers in secondary schools can deliver of the curriculum under grades 10,11 and 12," Kipsang said. He said this aims at helping the Kenya National Examination Council to finalise the assessment of the curriculum to develop an integrated examination module. With regards to PP1, PP2, Grades 1, 2 and 3, Kipsang said, so far, four designs had been distributed to both public and private schools. Kipsang said 12.5 million English, Kiswahili and Mathematics books have been printed and distributed. "Printing of another batch of 14.5 million books is underway and the books will be unveiled by mid-March," the PS said. Click here for the latest political news
