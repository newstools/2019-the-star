The anti-graft agency yesterday arrested Wajir Clerk Osman Mohamed for obstructing justice in an investigation involving the governor’s relatives and close allies. This follows Tuesday’s court orders obtained by EACC to freeze three bank accounts and stop the transfer or disposal of the old Toyota Land Cruiser VX 8 LC 200 in a 26 million scam. “Osman has refused to give documents to EACC for the last one year following the scam,” EACC Wajir Regional Manager Phillip Kagucia said on phone. The vehicle price is believed to be grossly inflated and intended to deprive the county government of Wajir of the true value for its money. It has never been transferred to the county government and remains registered under COSMOS Cars Ltd. “The funds were disbursed to DAAYO Construction and General Supplies Limited whose Directors are Osman Abdi Jimale and Ahmed Abdi Jimale, believed to be related to the Governor Mohamud Mohamed Ali (pictured),” investigators told the Star. Sh14m was spent by DAAYO Construction and General Supplies Limited to purchase the used motor vehicle from COSMOS Cars. “The remaining Sh 12m was diverted to Fine Trust Construction Co. Ltd - whose sole Director is Yasmin Jama Abdullahi, wife to Osman Abdi Jimale of Daayo Construction & General Supplies - for no apparent consideration and the money is likely to be embezzled,” the EACC report said.
