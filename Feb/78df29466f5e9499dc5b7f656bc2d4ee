Residents were yesterday shocked when a 14-foot African Rock python was captured at Loboi village in Marigat, Baringo South subcounty on Monday. The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) snake handlers (below) captured the serpent said to have been terrorising villagers since last week. “Leave alone scaring people at night, the huge reptile has also been attacking our livestock in broad daylight,” Loboi farmer Nickson Cherop said, adding that it used to kill one goat every week. Cherop, however, commended the KWS team for taking away the stray beast saying they can now afford to sleep, “although we fear there are many such lethal species in the area but at least we are relieved of this disturbing one,” he said. The python, weighing 80 kilogrammes, was spotted by locals who alerted the KWS last Friday. Click here for the latest political news
