Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has expressed concerns on the manner in which the ‘collapsed’ Sh7.2 billion Galana Kulalu food security project was implemented. Kingi said the project was a scam and they ‘saw it coming’ right from the beginning after counties that were affected by the project were not involved in the process. In an interview with journalists in his office on Wednesday, the governor said the more than Sh5.9 billion used in the project had yielded minimal returns. The county boss said the government's flagship project has now become a white elephant. The flagship project was initiated by the national government with an aim of addressing food insecurity in the country. It falls within parts of Kilifi and Tana River counties near the Tsavo East National Park. Kingi said when the project began, the counties questioned the move as to why the national government was pouring a lot of resources to a function that was already devolved. “It's not that the county must be given the mandate to do agriculture, that mandate is already with us through the Constitution, it’s a devolved function. Sadly, the national government never gave answers to their questions regarding the project," he said. Click here for the latest political news.
