Anti-graft officers on Friday arrested Wajir Clerk Osman Mohamed for obstructing justice in a scam involving Governor Mohammed Abdi Mohamud's relative and close allies. Mohamed was nabbed after refusing to produce documents related to a Sh26 million car purchase scam. “Osman has refused to give documents to the EACC for the last one year,” EACC Wajir regional manager Phillip Kagucia said on the phone. The price of vehicle is believed to be grossly inflated and intended to deprive the county of the true value for its money, he said. The car has also never been transferred to the county and remains registered under COSMOS Cars Ltd. “The funds were disbursed to DAAYO Construction and General Supplies Limited whose Directors are Osman Abdi Jimale and Ahmed Abdi Jimale, believed to be related to the Governor,” investigators told the Star. Lady Justice Hedwig Ong’udi granted orders stating that the application must be given priority due to its urgency. Ong’udi froze the Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd account numbers 1220004286 and 1226968627 that belong to DAAYO and General Supplies Limited and Fine Trust Construction Company. The court also prohibited COSMOS Cars Ltd from selling transferring, disposing of, wasting, or in any other way dealing with the motor vehicle in question. It also froze account number 1220004286 operated by DAAYO Construction and General Supplies Ltd, and account number 1226968627 operated by Fine Trust Construction Co. Ltd both at the Kenya Commercial Bank, Wajir Branch, pending the conclusion of the investigation. Click here for the latest political news
