Kenya Judo Association (KJA) will hold  national trails between February 23-25 to select a team for the forthcoming Continental Cup in Cape Town, South Africa. The tournament, which will feature both gender,  will be staged at the General Service Unit (GSU) Training School in Embakasi. KJA president, Shadrack Maluki, urged their affiliated clubs to send their strongest participants as the association seeks to send a competitive side to the African championship. “We are requesting teams to prepare adequately ahead of the event since those who will be selected will participate in the Continental Cup which will act as an Olympic qualifier,” observed Maluki. At the same time, team managers have been urged to forward lists of their participants and their weight categories, which is a condition for the competition by today.  Participants are free to bring along their cadets and junior players but must adhere to the International Judo Federation rules and sport code. Clubs will pay Sh1,000 for every player entered.
