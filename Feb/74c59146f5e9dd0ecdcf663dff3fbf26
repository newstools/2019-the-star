Kenyans have been called on to rise up against terrorism and radicalisation. Nyeri County Commissioner Fredrick Shisia said on Monday that sympathisers have even infiltrated security agencies in the country and everyone should be worried. He spoke during the county prayer breakfast organised by the Nyeri Ecumenical Bishops Association at a hotel in Nyeri Town. Nyeri hit the headlines when it was reported that one of the Dusit Hotel attackers in Nairobi had lived in Majengo, Nyeri Town. The administrator said terrorism was not only a security issue but also an ideological and political problem affecting the entire fabric of the community. He said the problem is slowly sinking roots in the county. Radicalisation was also reported to be taking place in the county. “I am happy to announce that we have been working with the National Counter Terrorism Center. We are linking up with other international bodies,” the archbishop said. “Our young people are being use for evil here in Nyeri after being promised a false heaven and entering the world of evil,” archbishop Anthony Muheria of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nyeri ssaid. The county has received funding from USAID and a local NGO that will work both with national and county governments to start discussing and fighting the vice radicalisatin and terrorism.
