Wajir leaders have been warned against hate and divisive politics. Woman representative Fatuma Gedi yesterday accused politicians she did not name of using the Supreme Court ruling that upheld Governor Mohamed Gedi’s election to cause rifts. Fatuma had supported former Governor Ahmed Abdullahi. “We have leaders who pretend to preach unity while spewing politics of hate and division on social media. It’s my hope that they’ll style up and behave like leaders residents can look up to for guidance,” she said. “The ruling might not be the outcome we wanted or worked so hard for, but no other legal redress can be sought as the Supreme Court rulings are final. Life must continue.” She said there were no winners and losers “as some would want us to believe”. The lawmaker promised to ensure proper use of public resources so residents can get the services they deserve. “Our constitutional democracy demands our participation all the time so the government of the day can never compromise accountability.” Wajir has been rocked by graft claims. For several months, EACC officials have been investigating alleged mismanagement of funds. Several officials have been arrested. Elsewhere, Wajir East MP Rashid Kassim urged the county administration to deliver on its mandate. “We’re deeply divided but can achieve greatness through empathy, healing and forgiveness. So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole of Wajir.”
