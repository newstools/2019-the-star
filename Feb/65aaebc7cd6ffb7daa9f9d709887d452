KCB coach Curtis Olago credited his team’s strength in depth in ending Kabras’ 10-match unbeaten record in the Kenya Cup on Saturday. The champions beat the league leaders 44-20 at a packed Impala Club to move level on 49 points with the sugar millers having a superior points difference. Olago said he was satisfied with the victor. “Our second half substitution won us the game. It was competitive contest but I believe in the final 15 minutes our boys showed energy and drive to score the final two tries to seal victory,” added Olago The introduction of Kenya Simbas prop Moses Amusala and forwards Griffin Musila and Ian Indimuli turned the tide in the bankers favour in the final 15 minutes of the match. Olago, however, said his team cannot afford to be complacent after ending the sugar millers unbeaten run. “It’s only one game. We still have five more before we get to the playoffs and so the boys can only enjoy it for the weekend before we resume training on Tuesday for our next match against Oilers,” added Olago. The bankers earned a bonus point win with a try each from Oscar Simiyu, Michael Wanjala, Brian Omondi, Nelson Nyandat and Griffin Musila. Darwin Mukidza added three penalties and a conversion. Substitute Samuel Asati also added three conversions for the winners who led 16-13 at the interval. Ephraim Oduor, George Nyambua and Mario Wilson scored a try each for the visitors with Phillip Wokorach adding a penalty and conversion. Kabras coach Henley Du Plessis blamed the team defence and poor decision making for the defeat. “We did not play well today the boys made bad decisions in both attack and defence and our execution let us down we have to go back to the drawing board” he added.
