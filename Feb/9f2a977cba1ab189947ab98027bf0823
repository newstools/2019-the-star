Garissa town residents have been told to register their land and pay rates to the county. Addressing a stakeholders forum for leaders, elders and youth, Chief Revenue  Officer Hassan Anshur said the department will soon start mapping both registered and unregistered plots in Garissa town. The aim is to increase land rate revenue  and facilitate issuance of title deeds. Lands CS Farida Karoney visited the town and promised to issue 50,000 title deeds. Only those who pay land rates and register plots will have an advantage, Anshur said. He said enumerators will soon be employed and they will work with elders, youth and women in registration. The chief officer said the majority of residents evade paying land rates. The forum was part of a series of meetings held for leaders to increase collection of revenue, tax, land rates and land registration  in the county. He urged members to stop  cash payments and pay for parking fees, sand and gravel single business permits, advertisements, daily market cess collection and cost-sharing paid at Provincial Referral hospital and subcounty  hospitals. He said the M-Pesa paybill number is 209118 and the KCB account number 1140761625.
