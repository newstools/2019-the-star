The National Treasury is set to conduct a head count for all pensioners and dependants countrywide. This move is aimed at updating the department's personal data with the objective of cleaning the pension payroll. In a notice on Wednesday, the exercise will commence from February 11 to May 3 at Huduma Centers countrywide. Pensioners are required to avail themselves at any Huduma Center close to them with their National ID/Passport and Bank Plate/ ATM Card. Dependants will require their National ID/ Passport, Birth certificates of deceased pensioner's children and death certificates of deceased pensioners. The objective of the exercise is to ascertain database accuracy and integrity for improved service delivery. Last year, it was stated that county workers remaining with five years to retire will not be forced to join a new pension scheme if MPs pass a government-sponsored Bill before Parliament. The County Government Retirement Scheme Bill, 2018  which is awaiting MPs' final approval for President Uhuru Kenyatta to sign it into law, will see thousands of county workers have their own pension scheme.
