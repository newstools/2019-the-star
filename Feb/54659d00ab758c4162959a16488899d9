Khaligraph Jones' ex-lover Cashy says the rapper has been reaching out to her. "He tries but I cut the connection because I do not want to continue talking to people I know we can't be together anymore," Cashy told Word Is on Wednesday. The two have been taking subliminal shots at each other online after Cashy revealed that she broke up with her fellow rapper because of physical abuse. She also claims he released a song dissing her. "I left because it got messy to protect myself because you can’t let yourself be in a place you’re constantly unhappy. Stability mentally and physically comes first," Cashy said. Cashy urged her fans to stop associating her with the singer. She is promoting her new song, titled 'Naitwa Cashy.'
