The Garissa county government yesterday started a drive to vaccinate one million animals. Livestock and Agriculture executive Issa Yarrow urged residents to take advantage of the free two-month exercise. Thirteen teams will be in charge, each vaccinating 4,000 animals daily — translating into 52,000. Rinderpest and the Rift Valley Fever are serious threats and vaccination is necessary. All 27 wards will be covered. Governor Ali Korane said the drive has come at a good time. The county plans to build a modern abattoir to process 1,000 animals daily. “We must be ready to invest in livestock production. Otherwise we run the risk of starting an abattoir that may run short of animals,” he said. “Livestock rearing used to be a serious business, especially after Independence. But many families are opting out without an alternative source of livelihood.” Livestock keeping has been declining in Garissa and other parts of northern Kenya. Residents blame worsening climate and drought. Korane said they must tackle animal diseases through routine vaccination. The county chief said Europe and the Middle East are ready to buy their livestock products. But first they must ensure quality of meat satisfies their standards. “We’ve bought enough drugs and facilities to test and treat these diseases. All the farmers are required to do is avail their animals for vaccination,” the governor said. The county government has also invested in water projects to support livestock and residents. Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Amey welcomed the vaccination drive. He called for a campaign to raise awareness on radio stations so no farmer is left out. “We want this exercise to succeed 110 per cent, with no animal left out. As we all know, livestock keeping is the backbone of our economy, hence, we need to take vaccination seriously,” Amey said.
