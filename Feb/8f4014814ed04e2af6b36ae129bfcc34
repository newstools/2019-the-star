A furious Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has read the riot act to inefficient clerks processing birth certificates in Narok. He was shocked, after an impromptu tour of their offices, that there was a backlog dating back to April last year yet they had the luxury of enjoying long lunch breaks. “The delaying approach by these officers in acquiring the important document was to lure the residents to bribe them in order to be serviced which is against the law.” he said. His attention was caught by a long queue outside the birth certificate office, but was shocked to learn that the clerks had a habit of enjoying long lunch breaks. He accused the officers of serving only 200 persons per day a situation that has made it difficult for the residents to acquire birth certificates. The angry CS also blamed the officers for taking long lunch breaks making hundreds of residents to remain stranded outside their offices. He had earlier issued a seven-day ultimatum to chiefs and their assistants in Narok County to find 2,600 school children who sat for KCPE examinations last year and return them to continue with theirs secondary school education. Matiangi said it is sad that the kids are still at home while the rest of the students across the country are continuing with their education. Matiang'i made the remarks after he met the administrators at Ololulunga High School in Narok South Sub County on Thursday.
