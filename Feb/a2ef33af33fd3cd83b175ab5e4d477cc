Bandari FC suffered a major blow after striker Wycliffe Ochomo was ruled out for up to six weeks with a severe dislocated right elbow. Ochomo, suffered the injury after falling awkwardly during their 1-0 win against Kariobangi Sharks in the Kenya Premier League at Moi Stadium, Kasarani on Saturday. Ochomo, came in for Benjamin Mosha in the 57th minute but barely lasted three minutes, as he was stretchered off at the hour mark, after an aerial tussle under pressure from a Kariobangi Sharks defender John Kuol in the penalty area. Ochomo, who was agonizing in pain, was rushed to Guru Nanak Hospital, where doctors were trying to align the joint. Bandari team doctor Ferdinand Mwalumbo confirmed Ochomo was discharged yesterday and is on recovery path. “Ochomo suffered a severe dislocation on his right elbow and will be on a commercial splint for three weeks to ensure the tendon heals, before he embarks on physio exercises. The earliest we can expect him back to training is after six weeks,” said Mwalumbo The dockers’ top scorer with five goals in the league, becomes the second player to be sidelined after left-back Paul Nkata suffered a fifth metatarsal foot bone injury during their draw with Tusker at Ruaraka on February 7. Nkata is expected back after three weeks. Another casualty Wilson Obungu, Bandari team manager, missed the match with dengue fever, is also doing well and is expected back next week, after being discharged from hospital on Saturday. Meanwhile, Bandari head coach Bernard Mwalala, who was also taken ill a few minutes after the match is fairing on well and is expected to return to training tomorrow. Bandari assistant head coach Nasoro Mwaboka said Ochomo’s injury was a big loss but they expect Congolese import Yema Mwana to rise to the occasion in his absence. Mwaboka was pleased with the result which was a revenge for the SportPesa Cup final loss to Sharks three weeks ago in Tanzania.
