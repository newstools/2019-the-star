MUSEMBI NZENGU/Police are holding a female worker at the Ikutha Level 4 Hospital as they investigate her suspected connection with al Shabaab. A Kitui court on Thursday allowed police to detain Emily Diana Makau, aged 22, for 14 days. She was brought before the Kitui principal magistrate Johnson Munguti but was not required to plead to any charges. DCI officer Elkana Mogire to court Makau was being investigated for possible involvement in acts of terrorism. She is suspected to have collected information for the purposes of committing a terrorist act. Makau was arrested in Mutomo on Wednesday and police said they required sufficient time to conduct investigations. The court consequently allowed the officers to hold her until February 28 when she will be produced in court. “Owing to the weighty issues raised regarding alleged involvement with al Shabaab terrorism activities I grant the application for the DCI to hold you for 14 days for investigations,” Munguti said. Last month, a multi-agency security team investigating DusitD2 terror attack widened its investigations to Kitui county after local police arrested three foreigners and a Kenyan in two hotels suspected to be terrorists. One of the suspects, a man of Somali descent aged 47 years, had a British passport bearing the name Muhudin Hassan, which police suspected was forged.  The other two suspects did not have travel or identification documents.
