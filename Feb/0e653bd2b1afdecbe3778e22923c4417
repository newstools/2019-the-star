Bandari centre half Bernard Odhiambo is eager to follow into the footsteps of his sibling and Harambee Stars assistant skipper David ‘Calabar’ Owino in plying his trade abroad in the near future. Odhiambo has been outstanding for the dockers since joining the club in 2017 and he believes it is just a matter of time before he joins his elder brother who turns out for Zambian champions Zesco United in the growing list of Kenyans who have turned professionals. The hard tackling defender admits to have come of age and draws inspiration in his quest to go professional from the training sessions he has had with Calabar whom he described as supportive as well as the experience of playing alongside Congolese national Felly Mulumba. The partnership between the two centre halves was voted the best last season as they leaked fewer goals in the Kenyan Premier League and have carried the same form to the current season, where the club has conceded only 12 goals in 14 matches. “I am looking forward to going professional in the near future. It has been my dream to follow the footsteps of my brother who has supported me in my career this far. We normally train together when he is around and he advises me on several areas of play ranging from tackles, how to win aerial challenges and read the game. I also believe I have gained a lot from playing alongside Mulumba who has been in the game for long. He has taught me on positioning and ability to win tackles fairly.” ]Odhiambo began his football career at Kakamega Homeboyz in 2013 but found it tough to break into the starting team hence signed for then National Super League side Nakuru All Stars the following year. His exploits in the lower tier saw champions Gor Mahia win his signature in 2015, where he had the privileged to play alongside his brother. However, breaking into the starting team proved hard for him, forcing him to sign for Bandari in 2017.
