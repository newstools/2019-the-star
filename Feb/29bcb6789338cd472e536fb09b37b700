Interior PS Karanja Kibicho has given a break down on how the government will use Sh6 billion to register 50 million Kenyans for the Huduma Namba. Speaking in an interview with Radio Jambo on Tuesday, Kibicho said the programme has three phases. The first is buying the kits that cost Sh1.7 billion. Thereafter, 50,000 people will be hired to do the registration at Sh1,500 per day. "Every sub-location will have five kits and five registration officers," he said. "The other cost is buying software, but the government decided to use Kenyan professionals to come up with the software."

"Once you get the Huduma Numba, you will use it for life. It will have all the information about an individual," he said. Kibicho said Kenyans can be registered wherever they are. "People will be required to give information about themselves to the registration officers. Their photos and fingerprints will be taken. You can't be registered twice," he said. Kibicho refuted claims that a DNA test will also be done. "There is no way the government can keep blood samples for 50 million people," he said. The Huduma Numba will be used by Kenyans to access services like applying for an ID, passport, driving licence or a birth certificate. Click here for the latest political news.
