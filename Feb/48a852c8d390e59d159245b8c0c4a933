A former cop found guilty of bashing the skull of a Mathare egg hawker in 2011 has been released after paying Sh100,000 fine. Makadara senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji yesterday ordered Gregory Wabwire to pay a fine of Sh100,000 or serve three years in prison. But he’d already paid Sh100,000 bail in 2014 so he got off scot-free. The principal magistrate found the former Administration Police officer guilty of viciously beating up Dominic Munywoki, 37. He suffered grievous head injuries and a broken leg. The hawker was hospitalised for two months. Munywoki had declined to move a handcart parked by the roadside when Wabwire ordered him to. Wabwire assaulted Munywoki on December 31, 2011, in Mathare slum. In 2014 Kithinji had allowed Wabwire’s release on Sh100,000 bail. That was the first time the former cop was charged. Wabwire had been accused of slapping Munywoki after he declined to move the cart. The hawker tried to explain that the handcart did not belong to him. The officer roughed him up and took him away.
