The Kerio Valley Development Authority has refuted claims that the contractor for the Sh63 billion Arror and Kamwerer dams is not on site. The KVDA said Italian firm CMC di Ravenna Itinera has made tremendous progress in the construction of the two dams at the heart of investigations by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. The authority affirmed that the contractor has already carried out project surveys, geotechnical and seismic refraction investigations, quarry surveys and preparation of designs, among other activities. “The contractor has also mapped the industrial and site camps for the projects,” KDA said in a statement. The authority said it had as well obtained relevant approvals from various government agencies, including Nema, necessary to implement the project. “Valuation of the land and property has been done on the upper areas, including dam site area, as well as a private land for the two projects, and are valued at Sh7.7 billion,” KVDA said. The National Land Commission has already published a gazette notice for the notice to acquire land parcels and doing public sensitisation programmes, which are expected to be completed by March 19, according to the agency. The authority said it could soon face a land crisis after the Kenya Forestry Service Board wrote to them declining to cede some 400ha initially agreed upon. Some 2,400ha is required for the two dams. The authority said that on February 13, it received a letter by the KFS board confirming it will not allow the construction of a dam in its land. “KFS did not approve authority to access portions of the forest land for the construction of Arror and Mamwarer dam projects, as requested by KVDA,” said the authority in the statement. As a way forward, KVDA said, the decision should be rescinded to allow project activities progress smoothly, devoid of related damage claims that may arise from the contractor and the financier of the load that may frustrate the Big Four Agenda.
