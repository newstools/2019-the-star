The level of water at the Ndakaini dam is dropping fast, raising fears of intensified rationing. The level was at 68.5 percent on February 4, compared to 73.97 percent at the same time in January this year. The water level was at 78.36 percent on December 4, 2018. Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company Head of Corporate Affairs Mbaruku Vyakweli however allayed fears of intensified rationing. Authorities have been applying water rationing to bridge the gap. Nairobi gets slightly over half a million cubic meters per day against a demand of 700,000 cubic meters. This means there is a water deficit of approximately 200,000 cubic meters per day. "We have been having rationing going on, it will not intensify as we expect short rains,"Vyakweli told the Star on phone. The Ndakaini Dam can store 70 million cubic metres at full capacity. The dam is 2,041 metres above sea level and 65 metres deep. It has a 75-square-kilometre catchment area. It includes Kimakia and Gatare forests in the Aberdares. Thika, Githika and Kayuyu rivers feed the dam. The dam produces 430,000 cubic metres daily, 84 per cent of Nairobi’s supply. The ongoing dry weather could see the water levels drop. This means that the water being used is solely from the dam. February according to the weatherman is normally a dry month over most parts of the country. The forecast for February 2019 indicates that most parts of the country will be generally sunny and dry throughout the month. The Central Highlands including Nairobi (Nyeri,Embu, Meru, Nyahururu, Murang’a) are expected to be mainly sunny and dry for most of the month. Vyakweli said they have been carrying out a crack down on illegal connections that has seen water losses. The Company in October 2018 procured a new system aimed at eliminating fraudulent and inflated water bills. The company has been losing more than Sh3.2 billion every year. Vyakweli said those operating car wash will also be discouraged from using clean water.
