A month after his employment, Kenyan chest specialist Joseph Aluoch pocketed Sh960 as his first salary. While that is laughable by today’s standards, Aluoch was among the highest paid civil servants in 1968. “At the time, there were very few people in the so-called ‘four-figure bracket’, that is, earning more than Sh1,000,” he says. That was April, 1968. Dr Aluoch also saw medical services grow from a time when wounds were only stitched with nylon sutures. “The syringes were made of glass and the needles were blunt and reusable after sterilisation by boiling water on a paraffin stove. But they did the job nicely,” he says. Commonly known as the ‘father of respiratory medicine’ in Kenya, Dr Aluoch is still practising at the Nairobi Hospital. “The effects of these changes are exciting and bewildering. We delight in the successes of medicine- and at times oversell it,” he says in his latest book, Fifty years of Health Services in Kenya ( 1968-2018 ). The 372-page book will be launched by Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki in Nairobi today. Dr Aluoch launched his autobiography ‘In the Footsteps of My Father’ in 2015, in which he explores his life in medical practice since 1968 in detail. In the new book, he uncovers,then tackles head-on mostly ethical issues that have dogged Kenya’s health system since Independence. He has also dedicated ample space to 35 other leading medics who explore the evolution of interventions such as heart surgery, epilepsy treatment, kidney care and mental health in Kenya. These include Kenya’s foremost cardiologists Prof Peter Odhiambo and Dr Dan Gikonyo, Dr David Silverstein, Prof George Oyoo, Dr Frank Njenga and Prof Erastus Amayo. This is probably the first Kenyan medical history compendium written by veteran doctors . Lawyer Dr Ambrose Rachier has also penned a chapter exploring issues such as confidentiality in HIV care and sperm donation. Click here for the latest political news
