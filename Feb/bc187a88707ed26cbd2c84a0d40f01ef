Chief Justice David Maraga on FridayÂ met top judges from across Kenya following days of sustained pressure and accusations of being a stumbling block in the war on corruption. Speaking after a closed door meeting with the judges at the Milimani law courts, Court of Appeal president William Ouko said the meeting was centred on the recent criticism that the Judiciary is the weakest link in the war on corruption. Ouko said the Judiciary has come up with several measures to expedite cases, including adding 10 magistrates to the Anti-Corruption court. Maraga has also mandated the magistrates to sit beyond the stipulated working hours to complete cases. According to the judges, between July 2017 and December 2018, a total of 91 corruption cases were determined with 46 leading to convictions. Currently 94 cases are still pending at the courts. Last Friday, Maraga fought off claims the Judiciary is the weakest link in the war on corruption. During the swearing-in of new EACC chief executive Mbarak Twalib on January 14, Maraga said the fight against graft must be carried out within the context of the rule of law and the Constitution. President Uhuru Kenyatta has previously accused the Judiciary of slowing the tempo in the war on graft through lenient sentences, lengthy trials and releasing suspects on favourable bond terms. But Maraga dismissed this notion and told the new EACC boss to collaborate with investigative agencies to submit formidable cases to court when they are also satisfied that they have chances of nailing the suspects. "If you are also not sure that the cases you are bringing are strong enough to secure convictions, what else to do you expect? The result of such trials will be obvious," he said. The Chief Justice admitted that the time cases take in court is a challenge the Judiciary is working on. Read: Maraga defends Judiciary from weak-link tag Click here for the latest political news
