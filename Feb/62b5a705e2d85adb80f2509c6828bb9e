Narok County will host this year’s Madaraka Day celebrations after Kajiado failed to prepare the stadium in advance. A statement from State House stated that the planning committee was concerned by slow construction of the stadium in Kajiado which was meant to be the venue of the event. “The committee expressed concerns that the Kajiado stadium's construction may not be completed within the remaining three months as earlier envisaged. Consequently, the President directed that this year's Madaraka Day celebrations be held in Narok County,” the statement reads. “By moving the celebrations from Kajiado to Narok, the government seeks to ensure that the benefits arising from the hosting of the national event are retained within the same economic block in line with the established trend of hosting some national events in the Counties,” the statement further reads. On February 2, President Uhuru Kenyatta had picked Kajiado to host the event after he had arrived from Arusha, Tanzania, where he had where he attended the 20th Heads of State Summit of the East African Community.
