The National Land Commission has managed to recover 6,000 titles for public land that had been grabbed throughout the country. Chairman Muhammad Swazuri says he is proud of his tenure at the NLC and he has no regrets ahead of the end of his tenure next month. “People can say what they want, but I’m proud to have been the first NLC chairman. Even if there are those who don’t want to hear that, it will remain a fact,” Swazi said. He said he will exit NLC with a clean and strong legacy The NLC boss has listed many of his achievements and says the commission had facilitated 80 major public projects costing more than Sh40 billion. Swazuri was addressing the media in Iten town after meeting Elgeyo Marakwet leaders about compensation for families set to be displaced by construction of the Sh62 billion Arror and Kimwarer dams in Kerio Valley. Swazuri said NLC has managed to resolve many perennial land problems in the country although he says problems associated with land will always exist. The NLC, he says, worked with a low budget which hindered its work. The commission needs more than Sh 7 billion annually to facilitate its work but has been receiving about Sh2 billion. The NLC boss says he was fought by cartels but most people appreciate the work they have done. “Go to all areas where we have worked and no one will tell you that Swazuri is a thief. We have done good things for Kenyans and I will talk about it everywhere I go.” Swazuri ,who is a land economist, said he had always been driven by the fear and respect for God. “There are those who hate me because maybe we took away land which they had grabbed but largely we have served many Kenyans as per the will of God and respect for the law,” Swazuri said. He said latest move where an anti-corruption court has barred him from accessing his office was a plot to undermine his work. He and six others were arrested and questioned about irregular SGR land acquisition.
