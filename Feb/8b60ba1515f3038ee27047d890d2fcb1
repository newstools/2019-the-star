The search for a missing Dandora human rights activist has been extended to water bodies and forests in Nairobi and its vicinity. Caroline Mwatha, a senior official at Dandora Community Social Justice Center, disappeared last Wednesday. She had been documenting cases of enforced disappearance and police extrajudicial killings, including the cold blood murder of six Dandora residents in October last year. The centre has tried in vain to locate the mother of two in hospitals, police stations and morgues within the city. Coordinator Wilfred Olal said they have written to relevant bodies to grant them access to forests and rivers. “We are now focusing on forests of Karura and Ngong,” he told the Star on phone on Monday. Olal said the search will also be conducted in Nairobi river. Mwatha's family is now worried that she could be part of the statistics she has been documenting. Olal said a vigil will take place at the centre on Monday from 4 pm.
