As the world marks Valentine’s Day, hundreds of flower farm workers in Naivasha have complained ofincreasing job losses. In the last three years, more than 6,000 workers have lost their jobs and others fear the numbers could rise due to harsh economic times. Flower farm owners have blamed a poor market, the high cost of labour, a rise in electricity charges and ‘punitive double taxation’. Last month, the Court of Appeal threw out an appeal by Karuturi Flower Farm. That cost more than 2,500 workers their jobs, barely a year after Oserian laid off a similar number. The Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Workers Union says tens of other workers have been sacked and contracted afresh at lower salaries. Secretary general of the union’s Naivasha branch Ferdinand Juma said in the last financial year, the sector earned Sh153 billion, up from Sh115 billion in the previous year. He said there were low wages, poor working conditions, lack of protective gear, sexual harassment and exposure to dangerous chemicals. Loss of jobs was the biggest problem, he said.
