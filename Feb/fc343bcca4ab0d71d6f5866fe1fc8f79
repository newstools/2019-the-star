A government official yesterday identified an axe used by a woman accused of hacking her mother-in-law to death three years ago. Henry Sang, a Government Chemist analyst, told Justice Christine Meoli in Kiambu that he received the axe on September 29, 2015. He was testifying in a case in which Caroline Wanjiku is charged with killing her mother-in-law, Ann Nyambura, on September 21, 2015 in Gishobo village, Kiambu. Wanjiku has denied the charges. Sang said he also received bloodstained swabsticks and cotton wool. The bloodstains were from Nyambura. “The DNA profile generated from the bloodstains on the axe and swabsticks matched those from the blood sample of Nyambura,” he said. Nyambura’s family lawyer Paul Elkington applied to visit the crime scene before the prosecution closes the case. The judge said she will first analyse the evidence in record to see whether it is necessary to visit the scene. Witness David Njenga, a boda boda operator, said Wanjiku called him at 10am to her matrimonial home. She told him to take her to her maternal home. The boda boda rider ferried her “without knowing what she had done”. Wanjiku said she was “driven by Satan”, who also wanted her to kill her mother and sister. She told investigators she saw visions of snakes coiled round her waist. “They asked me to kill the three relatives,” Wanjiku told the police. Police said she struck Nyambura in the head with an axe. The hearing continues on April 3.
