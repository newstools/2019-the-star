Two men have been charged with assaulting nurses at Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital. David Oyaro and Fredrick Onyango were accused of assaulting Christian Nyabera and George Mwangi on Sunday. The prosecution reports indicate that the nurses had reported to duty at around 7pm at the emergency and accident department. The police said Nyabera was in the minor theatre attending to a patient when Okeyo and Onyango brought in their relative who had facial injuries. They demanded that the relative be attended to immediately. The nurses said they had other emergency cases. They allegedly pounced on them with kicks and blows. Yesterday, they denied the charges before Makadara senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji and were released on Sh20,000 bail.The case will be heard on June 5. On Sunday, nurses’ union officials condemned “rising cases of attacks on caregivers”. Kenya National Union of Nurses Nairobi secretary Edia Muruli said health professionals give their best and must be respected and protected. “Many nurses have been injured and others killed, leaving a gap that we don’t know how the authorities will fill. We need to address this issue with the seriousness it deserves,” she said at the hospital.
