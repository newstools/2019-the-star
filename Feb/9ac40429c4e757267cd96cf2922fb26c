A food security technical team is touring Garissa’s subcounties to assess the extent of the drought now ravaging the region. The team, comprising Kenya Food Security Steering Group and Garissa technical officials, will determine the extent of the drought and analyse the impact of the 2018 short rains, according to Garissa coordinator of the National Drought Management Authority Abdinoor Dubow. Dubow said yesterday the experts will after the week-long tour advise on appropriate response mechanisms by the agriculture, livestock, water, health and nutrition, education, peace and security, and markets and trade sectors. The visit covers Fafi, Balambala, Lagdera, Dadaab, Ijara and Holugho. Dubow said emphasis will be given to water as most areas are experiencing acute shortages. “The overall objective of the rapid assessment is to determine the extent of the adverse effects of the drought,” he said. He added that the experts will present a report that will point out the way forward in the county’s five livelihood zones. The short rains season ended in December, according to the Drought Situation and Early Warning Phase Classification. SCHOOLS AFFECTED The average greenness as per the vegetation condition index for three months upto December reduced from 43.46 to 30.37 and falls on the moderate vegetation deficit category. Separately, Kenya Livestock Marketing Council vice-chair Dubat Amey said, “Forage is decreasing by the day, deteriorating livestock body condition. A significant number of animals has already started showing signs of emaciation.” Garissa Kenya National Union of Teachers executive Abdirizak Hussein said many children are still herding livestock and are yet to report for the first school term. “Learning institutions, especially boarding schools, have water shortages, posing a threat of an outbreak of diseases related to poor hygiene,” the Knut executive said.
