Singer Bahati's wife Diana Marua has finally addressed the drama around Mr Seed's controversial departure from EMB Records, which he blamed on the couple disrespecting his pregnant wife. Marua wrote on Instagram: "Pillars are meant to stand strong… When God Blesses you, you owe no one an explanation." In another post, she added: "Being taken to levels I never thought I’d get to because I was made to stand out, not to fit in." In a previous interview, Seed opened up on the eviction from Bahati's concert. "I got a call from my wife saying, ‘Babe, bouncer and police have come to beba me'." Mr Seed's exit was a blow to EMB, coming in the wake of the departure of another talented artiste, David Wonder.
