The Beyond Zero Half Marathon slated for March 10 at Nyayo Stadium is targeting 25,000 participants this year. Speaking yesterday at State House, event organiser Peter Gacheru said online and manual registration is ongoing with elite athletes expected to part with Sh2,500 and other participants Sh2000. Gacheru said the event will feature 21km, 10km, 5km, a special 2km race for pregnant women as well as Paralympic race for T11 , T12 and T13. There will also be a 21km wheelchair half marathon event, 21km tricycle half marathon as well as the 10km corporate event. “For this year’s event, we have introduced special race for the pregnant women as well as well Paralympians and we expect good turnout across all race categories,” added Gacheru Winners in the 21km race will pocket Sh250,000 with the second-placed finisher pocketing Sh125,000. Third placed will pocket Sh75,000 richer. In the 10km race, the winner will go home with Sh100,000 with the runner up settling for Sh60,000 and the third placed finisher bagging Sh20,000.

The tricycle winners will pocket similar amounts for the first three places. Gacheru said they will set up camp at this weekend’s national cross country championships in Eldoret in a bid to register more athletes. “ We are in Eldoret this weekend and we want to get as many athletes as possible from that region,” he added. Former world marathon champion Douglas Wakihuri, who is the First Lady’s trainer for the event, said preparations for the event are going on smoothly. “We have trained well for the last fortnight and we do have three weeks to go.” This will be the fourth edition of the event.
