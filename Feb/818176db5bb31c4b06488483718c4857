Construction of the road connecting Thika Road and Nairobi-Nakuru highway is yet to begin since it was commissioned last year. Residents say one week after the road was commissioned by Deputy President William Ruto on June 22, the contractor came with earth movers, removed the old tarmac and left. Motorists Peter Kimani yesterday said the road is now dusty, potholed, gets muddy and slows movement when it rains. “We are suffering more than we used to when it was tarmacked with potholes. During the dry season, the road is dusty. Women living next to the road wash clothes and hang them inside since the dust makes them dirty again,” he said. The 47Km road, which cuts across Lari, Githunguri and Ruiru constituencies, was commissioned at Kwa Maiko in Githunguri and will cost Sh4 billion to build. It is popularly known as Uplands-Githunguri-Ruiru road. Ruto was accompanied by Infrastructure CS James Macharia and MPs Gabriel Kago (Githunguri), Jonah Mburu (Lari) and Jude Njomo (Kiambu), among others, when he commissioned it. China Guansu Engineering Company said it removed the tarmac to pave way for construction. Engineers Joseph Theuri and Njoki Mungai recently told residents that once clearing is complete, the actual construction will begin and run smoothly. Residents, however, criticised the contractor for the slow progress and urged the Kenya National Highways Authority to investigate the company.
