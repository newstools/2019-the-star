Kenya AutoBazaar Association has written to President Uhuru Kenyatta over the age limit of second-hand vehicles. In an open letter on Tuesday, chairman John Kipchumba asked Uhuru to hold talks with Trade CS Peter Munya over the National Automobile policy. The policy among other issues limits the age of imported used cars into the country from the current eight years to five years. The policy also states that the number of years will be reduced to three years by 2021. Kipchumba wants the age limit to stay at eight years without any deductions. "We strongly feel and believe that this policy is very discriminative and solely designed and motivated to frustrate and completely destroy the used car import business in Kenya," he said. Kipchumba noted that they contribute Sh49 billion in taxes annually and provide jobs to thousands of Kenyans. "Your Excellency, we are disheartened by the fact that the ministry deliberately chose to put us aside during the development of this vital policy," he said. The chairman urged the Ministry to involve them while coming up with the policies adding that Munya should put on hold the implementation and instead convene new consultative programs. Last week, the government reinstated its plans to cap the age limit of imported cars to five years. Munya said the policy would apply for vehicles with an engine capacity of above 1,500 cubic centimetres, will be implemented on July 1 and reduce to an age limit of three years by 2020. The government’s decision is guided by the East African Community that recommends slashing of the age limit to five years by 2021, in a raft of measures intended to promote local manufacturing industry in the region.
