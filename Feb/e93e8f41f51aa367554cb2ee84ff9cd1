Anti-graft officials yesterday questioned Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud over alleged embezzlement of Sh26 million in a car purchase scam. EACC detectives say taxpayers' money was wired to Daayo Construction and General Supplies Limited, whose directors are Osman Abdi Jimale and Ahmed Abdi Jimale, believed to be related to Mohamud. The investigators say Sh14 million of Sh26 million was spent by the company to buy a used vehicle from Cosmos Cars Ltd. The car's registration number is KCQ 004U Toyota Land Cruiser VX 8 LC 200 Series. The vehicle is believed to be grossly overvalued and intended to deprive the Wajir government of the true value for its money. "The commission notes that the vehicle has never been transferred to the county government of Wajir and remains registered in the name of Cosmos Cars Ltd," a source at EACC told the Star yesterday. The high-end vehicle, which has since been seized by EACC, was bought in July last year. The commission also noted that the remaining Sh12 million was diverted to Fine Trust Construction Co Ltd, whose sole director is Yasmin Jama Abdullahi, wife of Osman Abdi Jimale of Daayo Construction & General Supplies Ltd. The detectives who have been investigating the matter says that there is no justification as to why the amount was wired to the company and the money is likely to be embezzled. Two weeks ago, EACC lawyer Phillip Kagucia successfully applied to the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Court to prohibit the transfer or disposal of the vehicle and also the freezing of the accounts operated by the two companies, pending conclusion of investigations. The accounts, according to EACC, are held at the Kenya Commercial Bank, Wajir Branch.
