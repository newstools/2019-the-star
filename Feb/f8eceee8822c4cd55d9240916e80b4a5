Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and a refugees team will run for the first time ever at the national cross country championships-cum-trial set for Eldoret Sports Club next weekend. Athletics Kenya (AK) will be seeking to select Team Kenya to do duty at the world Cross Country Championships set for Aarhus, Denmark on March 30. Evans Mayaka will lead the KWS senior men’s team that also has Eliud Mutahi, Mike Boit, Bernard Kimeli, Kiprono Kimei and Cornelius Kosgei as they seek to make debut not only at home but at the World Cross. However, they will not have an easy ride as they compete against seasoned athletes led by world champion Geoffrey Kamworor of National Police Service, Kenya Prisons, Kenya Defence Forces as well as teams from the regions with North, Central and South Rift expected to be a handful. Over 110  senior men will compete for the six positions available for the trip to Denmark. AK president Jack Tuwei said the move is aimed at opening the sport to more athletes thus increasing competition with the ultimate goal of selecting the strongest team for the global showpiece. “We have brought the cross country championships to the owners. This will be an electrifying moment in Eldoret with many runners coming from this region. We want to ensure that the event is successful,” said Tuwei. Refugee team will be led by Dominic Lokinyomo, Paulo Amotun, Simon Ayon, Pur Biel, Dominic Lokolong, Ubaa Dinta and Ukuk Uthoo. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, the host and sponsor alongside Lotto Foundation, promised to market and hype the event to ensure that many fans turn up come net Saturday.
