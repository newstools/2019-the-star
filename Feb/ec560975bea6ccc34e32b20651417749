Are you planning to tour Uganda? Well, I guess you have to identify the sites where you are supposed to visit. There is a new tourist product in Uganda which you need to know. Tourism Minister Godfrey Kiwanda unveiled an initiative to recognise curvy and sexy ladies as part of tourists products. 'Miss Curvy Uganda’ was launched to select sexy curvaceous women and the finalists will be selected in June. According to Daily Monitor Uganda, Kiwanda said Uganda has naturally 'endowed nice looking' women that are amazing to look at. "Why don’t we use these people as a strategy to promote our tourism industry?” Kiwanda wondered, pointing at “a sample” of beautiful women at the press conference on Tuesday. Most tourists visit Uganda to tour national parks for diverse wildlife species such as gorillas, birds and other animals. They will also have an added advantage of viewing curvy and sexy Ugandan women. Kiwanda said Uganda has long appreciated smaller bodied women as a hallmark of beauty and the curvy pageant is just another campaign aimed at appreciating beauty in diversity.
