23% of the total deaths that occur in Nyamira county are as a result of suicide cases within families. This has been said by Nyamira county Commissioner Amos Mariba who said the cases are from either frustrations among other issues. "We have experienced a number of people dying very funny ways in the county and we want to urge them to seek counseling in matters that affect them so that they can be able to stay alive and take care of their families," Mariba said on Thursday. The administrator further noted that there is fear that the cases may rise from the current percentage if a serious step is not going to be taken to curb the rising cases of suicide in the county saying many families are suffering as a result of losing their beloved once to suicide. We have fear that if we are not going to have measures undertaken to do away with the suicide cases,then we must be prepared to lose many lives,that is why we have to guide our people against going for suicide since it may not solve some of their problems in this live," he said. According to World Health Organization (WHO) report released in 2014,reveals that a person dies after every 40 to 55 seconds in the world as a result of suicide and that majority of the suicide victims are youths between 23 to 31 years whereby unsolved depression among the youth is cited as the major cause followed by alcohol and drug abuse. He cited the production and consumption of illicit brew as one of the many contributors to the suicide missions since once an individual is drunk and has some issues with his family or he is facing challenges it is the time the individual will make uninformed decision and go for suicide,where he discouraged the production and consumption of illicit brew. One among the major contributors of the suicide cases in the county is the continuous production of illicit brew because once someone takes the brew he cannot be able to make informed judgement and that is why many families end up breaking or such related cases are experienced.Therefore as government we will continue to fight production of illicit brew so that we can have sanity in our society," the security officer said.
