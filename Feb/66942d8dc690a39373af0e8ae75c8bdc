Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula wants the IEBC to hold a free, fair and credible by-election in Wajir West constituency on April 25. The Bungoma Senator said the electoral body must ensure the election is conducted with integrity to give the residents of Wajir West their preferred candidate. “This is another litmus test for the Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission. I urge the electoral body to ensure the election is devoid of any irregularities,” he said. Wetang'ula was speaking at the party headquarters after receiving Nairobi businessman Daudi Muhammed Ali's credentials to vie for the seat. “We have today received our candidate for the Wajir West by-election, and we are confident he is a sure bet for that seat,” Wetang'ula said. The seat fell vacant following a ruling by the Supreme Court, which established votes were manipulated in favour of Mohamed Kolosh of ODM during the August 8, 2017, poll. This followed a petition by voter Ibrahim Mohamed Abdirahman. “Ford Kenya will marshal enough resources to ensure our candidate wins. People know our party brags of good leadership and honesty. We are here to serve the people and that is why our party is popular everywhere,” Wetang'ula said. Clan politics plays a central stage in Wajir politics with Degodia and Ajuran clans forming the major voting blocs. Daud Mohamed is the only candidate among the majority Walemege subclan of the Ajuran clan. Click here for the latest political news
