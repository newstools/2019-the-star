A woman from a remote Turkana village has given birth to twins through caesarean section. The successful operation was the first of its kind at Lorugumu Subcounty Hospital, Loima. Previously, pregnant women from Loima had to endure long travels to Lodwar County Referral Hospital if their conditions demanded they undergo C-section. Many died on the way while others had stillbirths. This will now change. On Monday, Dr Ekiru Kidalio of the Lorugumu Subcounty Hospital, Loima, dared to change the situation. The operation marked a turnaround. “It wasn’t something strange to be done. Only that the environment in which we carried out the first caesarean operation wasn’t ideal. But as Nelson Mandela once said, it always seems impossible until it’s done,” Kidalio said. “Generally, the experience was the first caesarean section surgery done successfully in a remote facility.” The delivery came barely three weeks after the county, the Centre for Public Health and Development, the International Rescue Committee and the UKAID launched a solar-powered comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care unit at the hospital. It is meant to improve access to mother-child care. Health executive Jane Ajele said they are out to reduce maternal deaths. She said a mother is four times likely to die giving birth in Turkana than in most parts of Kenya. The county is committed to registering positive statistics. Loima medical officer Gertrude Nasike said the operation was a milestone.
