Nairobi County Executive Committee members will be impeached if they ignore summonses from assembly committees. Governor Mike Sonko yesterday gave MCAs the go-ahead to take action against defiant executives and urged the legislators to help tame graft at City Hall. He was responding to concerns by Majority leader Abdi Guyo and Majority Whip Waithera Chege. Sonko said county assemblies should be empowered to carry out their oversight mandate. The governor, however, cautioned the legislators not to take advantage of their role to undermine or blackmail his executives. “To my CECs and chief officers, if you are summoned, honour the invitation. But respect is a two-way road, so my officers must also be respected,” Sonko said.
