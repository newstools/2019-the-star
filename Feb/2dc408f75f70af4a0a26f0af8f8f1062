Mandera Governor Ali Roba wants the national government to stop duplicating functions meant for the counties. He wants at least 50 per cent of revenues collected in the previous year allocated to the counties — not 15 per cent of the last audited accounts. Roba accused the government of withholding a lot of cash. He presented his memorandum to the Building Bridges Initiative task force in a Mandera hotel. Roba cited agriculture whose functions were devolved, yet a lot of resources are still held by the central government. “If water is devolved, the resources allocated to water should go to the counties directly. The impact of the little resources received through devolution is extremely apparent in the counties and evidenced by the results over the first six years of devolution,” he said. “Institutions like Kerra and Kura have no roles to play. They have no plan for the budget they are allocated.” He said Kenha should take charge of all national roads and given more funds.
