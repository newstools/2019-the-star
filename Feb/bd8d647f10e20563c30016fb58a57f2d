The court will tomorrow watch a confession video of one of the suspects in the murder of lawyer Willie Kimani. Justice Jessie Lessit yesterday adjourned the hearing after defence lawyers said Chief Inspector Geoffrey Kinyua was reading the confession yet it had not been supplied to them. Assistant DPP Nicholas Mutuku admitted they had not supplied the video. Suspects in the murder are police informer Peter Kamau and AP officers Fredrick Leliman, Stephen Cheburet, Sylvia Wanjiku and Leonard Mwangi.

Tomorrow, Kinyua is expected to take to the witness stand again and read the confession. Before he was stood down, he said he recorded the confessions on August 9, 2016 in his office. He said Kamau was in his office and asked to write his statement in the presence of his brother. Police called the brother. The statement was recorded in English. Kinyua said Kamau asked him to write the statement for him and that he would read it when complete and sign. “Police have reasons to believe Kamau was connected with the murder and that’s why he confessed,” he said. The court also heard that Kamau was warned about the seriousness of the offence and reminded that his confession would be used as evidence. Kinyua said Kamau agreed and signed the statement using his thumbprint. “Most accused persons often deny their signatures so we use the thumbprint because it is authentic,” Kinyua said. The prosecution is expected to close its case next week. More: Slain lawyer Kimani’s car seen on highway minutes after abduction Click here for
