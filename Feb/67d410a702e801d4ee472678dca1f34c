The delayed merger between Ford Kenya and ANC is strategic and not a sign of collapse, Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula has said. The Ford Kenya leader said yesterday that he, his ANC counterpart Musalia Mudavadi and other leaders were working behind the scenes to achieve Luhya unity. “The 2022 election is still three years away and if we announce any unity pact now it will be infiltrated and collapse before the election,” he said. Luhya leaders will make their 2022 plans known a year to the election, Wetang’ula said on Radio Jambo.
