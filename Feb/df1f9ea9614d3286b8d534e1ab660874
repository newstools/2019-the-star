The Mandera county government has extended its sanitation programme to the subcounties. The exercise was launched in October last year by Governor Ali Roba who said it was meant to ensure people live in a clean environment. Devolved chief officer Yussuf Didow urged residents to do their part to keep their environment clean. He spoke in Kutulo town on Saturday where he launched the sanitation programme. Mandera is grappling with increased solid waste especially plastic bottles littered everywhere. The waste clogs drainage systems causing flooding during rainy seasons. Didow said garbage partly contributed to disease outbreaks. “I want to appeal to Mandera residents to be responsible and stop dumping litter everywhere. Every person has the right to a clean and healthy environment as enshrined in Article 41 of the Constitution,” he said. In 2006, Mandera was hit by chikungunya and cholera outbreaks that killed 19 people. Two weeks ago, Deputy governor Mohamed Arai flagged off new sanitation trucks for the seven subcounties to be used for garbage collection. He warned that any person caught throwing litter anywhere instead of depositing it in designated places will be arrested and charged. Governor Roba’s administration has hired 342 sanitation staff across the county. Most of them are women and the youth who are selected by communities through public participation in the seven subcounties.
