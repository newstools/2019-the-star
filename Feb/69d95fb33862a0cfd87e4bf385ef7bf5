Kenya Power has assured Kenyans that there won't be a national power outage as has been reported on social media. In a statement, the power supplier said the misleading information is a misinterpreted alert it issued for specific areas where it plans to carry out routine maintenance. "The information is misinterpreted from a regular alert on routine scheduled preventive maintenance carried out by the company issued to customers prior for planning purposes." "As such, normal service continues as we endeavour to keep lights on for our customers," the company said in a tweet. Kenya Power routinely issues alerts whenever it plans to interrupt power supply to carry out repairs, upgrade or transfer power lines or connect new customers.

In Nairobi for instance, the company said the shutdown on Sunday would affect Westlands, Parklands, Runda, Evergreen, Karura, CID Kiambu Road, Loresho and Kabete between 9am -5pm. But the alert issued on Saturday appeared to have thrown a section of Kenyans into panic mode. Some started circulating messages on social media asking friends and family to charge their phones ahead of the scheduled outage. "Charge your phone because Kesho hakuna stima Kenya mzima," reads one of the messages. Click here for the latest political news
