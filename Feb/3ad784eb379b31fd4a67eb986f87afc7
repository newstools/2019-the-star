Environmentalists have warned that industrialisation is becoming a big threat to the marine ecosystem in Mombas Major projects such as the Dongo Kundu bypass could cause ecological ruins, for instance in the Mkupe Creek where a bridge will be built, they say. The Kenya Maritime Authority says the country has lost 18 per cent of its mangrove forest over 25 years at an annual average rate of about 0.7 per cent. Director general George Nyamoko said mangroves are cleared for other land uses that lead to pollution. On Thursday, Mombasa Kilindini Community Forest Association treasurer John Nyamwaya said the bypass could turn into a curse to the Tsunza community if the problem is not fixed. The authority has launched tree planting and called for strict adherence to maritime safety guidelines.
