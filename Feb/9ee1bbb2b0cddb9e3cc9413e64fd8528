The Kenya Wildlife Service has issued an alert on increased incidences of human-wildlife conflict. In a statement sent to the newsroom on Saturday, KWS said the ongoing dry spell being experienced in most parts of the country is displacing wildlife from their traditional habitats in search of pasture and water. “This has increased conflict as the wildlife comes into contact with the public and human activities. KWS wishes to inform the public that as the dry spell progresses, the risk of human-wildlife conflict is expected to increase until the country receives the long rains,” said Paul Gathitu, KWS corporate communications officer.

Kenya region. He said members of the public should report to KWS offices whenever incidents occur or when wildlife is sighted. “The public is also advised not to set fires close to protected areas as these fires are likely going to cross over into the protected areas and further worsen the conflict as wildlife exit to public areas,” said Gathitu. “In the meantime, KWS has enhanced surveillance to ensure that the public is protected from wildlife. Foot, vehicle and aerial patrols have been intensified to manage the situation.” Also read; Conservationists partner to end human-wildlife conflict Click here for the latest political news
