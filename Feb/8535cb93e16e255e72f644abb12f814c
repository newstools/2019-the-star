A former OCS found guilty of killing an inmate in December 2013 will be sentenced today. In a High Court ruling by Judge Stella Mutuku in December last year, Nahashon Mutua was found guilty of killing Martin Koome Imanyara, an inmate at Ruaraka police station. He tried to frame Kevin Odhiambo, another inmate at the station, for it. Koome was a miraa trader at Baba Dogo shopping centre in Ruaraka, Nairobi. He had returned home drunk after the day’s work and is said to have “normal” domestic squabbles with his wife. He then threatened to jump from their storeyed house while carrying their three-month old baby. The wife screamed, calling for help from neighbours, who in turn called the police. Officers arrived and arrested Koome and booked him at Ruaraka police station. At the station, he refused to enter into the cells, arguing he did nothing wrong that warranted his arrest. It was at that point that the OCS intervened, beating him until he passed out, court papers showed. He used a ridged metal pipe to pound Koome, inflicting fatal injuries. Rights group International Justice Mission took up the matter alongside the Independent Policing Oversight Authority and documented the evidence that eventually nailed the former cop. The prosecution showed the trial court how Mutua went to a great lengths to obstruct justice, even offering a Sh1 million bribe to investigators besides trying to frame Odhiambo. Read: Ex-Ruaraka OCS Nahashon Mutua convicted of inmate's murder “After committing the murder, the accused took steps to cover up by intimidation, issuance of threats and framing PW5,” court papers said. Odhiambo was a robbery with violence suspect. He was later released as the prosecutors nailed the officer. The case is the first high profile conviction of an officer accused of extrajudicial killing. The punishment the court will proffer is expected to give a serious boost to the anti-extrajudicial killing crusade in the country. Click here for the latest political news
