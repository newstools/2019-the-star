When a parent leaves home to go and collect money, his family waits for his return, hoping that the cash will alleviate part or the whole of its financial challenges. However, this is not the case for a family in Bushiangala village, Ikolomani, Kakamega. Hannington Kaluna, 84, left home on January 24 to collect his Sh2,000 monthly government stipend for the elderly in Kakamega town. He is yet to return home. Kaluna did not reach the bank. The family is now searching for him across the county. The old man retired from the Kenya Defence Forces in 1986 and since then has been serving as a lay leader at Bushiangala Church of God. Daughter Judith Luyundi said they suspect that he may have suffered memory loss because of age and forgot to trace his way back home. “When he did not come back, we went to check in the bank to establish whether he had reached there. It turned out that he never transacted any transaction on that day, confirming he never reached the bank,” Luyundi said. Another daughter, Adelite Khakai, said their father got lost because there was no one who could escort him to the bank to get his money. “We as daughters have already left home and gotten married and it then forces the old man to come to Kakamega on his own regardless of his advanced age,” Khakai said. Khakai now wants the government to change the approach and pay the elderly their stipends closer to their homes where they don’t need escort. The elderly, aged 70 and above, get Sh2, 000 monthly from the government programme. The family has reported the disappearance at the Malinya police station. Last year, Labour and Social Protection CS Ukur Yatani said the old card system had been scrapped. Beneficiaries are paid through Cooperative, Equity and KCB banks as well as Post Bank of Kenya.
