Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter and nominated senator Gertrude Musuruve have separately demanded answers from Education CS Amina Mohamed over delays to disburse funds to schools. Keter sought to know the sustainability of the 100 per cent transition to secondary school. He wants Amina to explain to Parliament if there are adequate facilities and teachers to cater for the students. “Schools do not have resources and facilities to handle the situation,” the legislator said. Musuruve was also asking the CS to explain what has lead to delays in disbursing funds meant for free primary and secondary school education. “There has been an outcry that some head teachers are not able to manage the day to day running of the schools simply because the funds have not been disbursed in good time,” she said. Keter said some schools have exceeded the appropriate number of streams and students per class and have not adhered to the recommended teacher-student ratio. He argued that Treasury has delayed in disbursing National Government Constituency Development Fund. Last month, the Ministry of Education issued a directive that all the 993,718 candidates who sat last year’s Kenya Certificate of Primary Education should proceed to secondary school.
