Catherine Kamau, popularly known as Kate Actress, says her son's pleas for spacious and joint housing pushed her to work harder. "My son would call me and ask me if I had gotten a big house so I could stay with him," Cate told Massawe on Thursday. The stylish mother of one says her mother helped her a lot in bringing up her son after she moved out. "I started living in a bedsitter, but I would make sure I visit my son at my mum's house, and on weekends, have him stay at my place," she said. Her son always asked her why her house was small, and that motivated her to keep working hard. "'Why don't I live with you?' he'd say. I would cry every day and tell God to let this be my motivation," she said. She is now married to Philip Karanja for almost two years. The two, who started off as actors on 'Mother-in-Law' on Citizen TV, just cannot stay away from each other. "He was my director in the show and really helped me package my career. I love him because he is an organised person with a lot of potential," she said. The worst trolls she getsÂ are when she posts pictures with her husband and "people write ugly things about us". "It feels so bad, knowing that my life has been a journey, and some even involve my son," she said.
