Seven suspected thugs were on Sunday night shot dead by police in a botched robbery at a warehouse in Industrial Area, Nairobi. The seven are said to have tried to steal gas cylinders from the go down when an alarm was raised alerting police. Five other suspects were arrested in relation to the incident and recovered the cylinders on a canter. The gang had apparently gone to the Softa go down and held two guards on duty hostage before they started to load the cylinders onto another lorry. Richard Kerich, the Nairobi Deputy Police Commandant said police officers were alerted and managed to kill the seven on the spot. The bodies were moved to the City Mortuary.
