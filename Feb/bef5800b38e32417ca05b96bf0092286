Former
Kisumu assembly Budget committee chairman Steve Owiti is contesting his removal. Respondents in the case are Speaker Onyango Oloo, the assembly clerk and the Public Service Board. Owiti told the Star on Tuesday he wants the court to block the decision last Tuesday to swear in Judy Ogaga as the
new budget chair. He said he was removed as a "sacrifice" because he opposed irregular spending of county founds. Owiti said procedures were not followed in removing him and he was never given a reason. The court hearing will begin on March 6. On Tuesday last week, some MCAs shouted, pushed and pulled prevent Ogaga from being sworn in. Speaker Oloo adjourned the assembly for 15 minutes to restore calm. Immediately the session resumed, Oloo approved the swearing-in and chaos erupted. The sergeant-at-arms guarded the area while Ogaga took the oath. Owiti told the Star that when the assembly reconvened on Tuesday from recess there was notice of a Budget committee meeting, but no agenda. The meeting didn't happen as the Order Papers called for swearing-in  a new chair. Owiti Said he is not opposed to removal but said a valid reason must be given and procedures followed. He blamed Oloo. Majority leader Kenneth Odhiambo said, "I am dismayed by what transpired today. The speaker is partisan and if this continues, he will be blamed for not exercising leadership." Liaison chair Roy Samu disagreed and said Owiti's removal was a committee matter, a petition was presented and discussed and a vote of no-confidence taken. Oloo told the assembly that physical violence and assault are forbidden and told unruly members to behave themselves. The Speaker said that on January 1 he received a notice signed by 10 Budget committee members stating they had no confidence in Owiti and were considering his removal.
