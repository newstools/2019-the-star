A Kibera court on Friday sentenced a 52-year-old man into life imprisonment for defiling his teenage daughter. Senior Residence Magistrate Irenee Kitagwa convicted Francis Mutemi after she found him guilty of the offence. Kitagwa ruled that the prosecution had proved that indeed the accused committed the offense on his 16-year-old girl. “It is the responsibility of the father to protect the child in all manner and circumstances, however the accused person who is the father to the defiled child did not protect her and instead preyed on her sexually, therefore the court has found him guilty and sent him to life imprisonment, such people should be omitted within the society,” said the Magistrate.
