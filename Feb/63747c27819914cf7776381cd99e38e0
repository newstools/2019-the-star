We sat on the open verandah at the impressive Ole Sereni Hotel, as we looked out over the expansive plains before us that form part of the Nairobi National Park. Some buffalo drank at a waterhole located directly in front of the hotel. A large herd of bohor reedbuck grazed and rested nearby, with some Coke’s Hartebeest. In the distance, a herd of giraffe was feeding on acacia trees. A large variety of various species of birds was also visible, and we were also able to witness a beautiful sunset over the Ngong Hills, as we dined on a fine selection of great-tasting food and drink. As we looked out over the wonderful natural scene in front of us, it was almost hard to imagine that Nairobi megacity was behind us. Like a protected cocooned capsule, the Ole Sereni Hotel is well positioned for people who want to visit Kenya for various reasons. Businesspersons will find that the hotel is perfectly located to be able to move easily onto the main transport road network, while tourists going on a Kenyan safari will find the hotel to be a refreshing stopover, as they arrive from the airport and prepare to drive elsewhere within East Africa. Guests feel secure and cared for, as the staff are friendly and professionally efficient. We really enjoyed our breakfast, as we sat on the open terrace and were surrounded by the sights and melody of many wild birds. Yes! The Ole Sereni is unique in that it is the only hotel worldwide that is located in a major city, and yet bordering directly next to an incredible national park. The entire experience was indeed a “Sereni scene”, definitely a venue to recommend for any event, business or leisure.
