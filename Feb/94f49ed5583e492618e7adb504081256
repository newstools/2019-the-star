The Kyome-Thaana Nzau ward MCA, Alex Wambua, is accusing the Kitui department of infrastructure of failing to pay 91 his people Sh300,000 for clearing bushes last November. In a press conference in Kitui town on Friday, Wambua called on the governor Charity Ngilu to inter to have the people who worked for 10 days and on a daily stipend of Sh350 be paid immediately because they were pestering. The ward  representative faulted Kitui county executive for inhumane and unfair treatment of his poor people by failing to pay them for the work they executed under the supervision of village administrators. “It was a youth and women empowerment programme that was supervised by the village administrators who did a lot of donkey work and were too not paid. If the governor means well for the people, let her intervene and make sure the people are paid,” Wambua said. But in his  response, the Kitui  county chief officer  for lands and infrastructure, Christopher Syengo, called on the MCA and the people from his area who worked in the bush clearing project to be patient as they will soon be paid their money. “Tell the MCA his people will be paid. In fact those who worked in the project in other areas of the county have been paid. I will make sure  the contractor pays the people of  Kyome-Thaana as the payment programme in  currently on course,” he said when we reached him for comment on phone.
