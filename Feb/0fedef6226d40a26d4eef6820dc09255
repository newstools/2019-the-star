A Kiambu court on Friday declined to grant police three more weeks to continue detaining a taxi driver linked to the murder of Midred Odira. Chief magistrate Patricia Gichohi released David Ochieng Sh200,000 bail, pending completion of investigation. She ordered the suspect to report to the DCI office in Kasarani three times per week until detectives complete their investigation. Gichohi directed that in case Ochieng fails to raise bail, he should be remanded at Kasarani police station for 10 days until March 4. The magistrate said she considered the fact that the suspect has been in custody since February 4. Gichohi said she also considered the right of the suspect and that of Odiraâ€™s family. The prosecution had earlier informed the court that investigators are seeking three more weeks since the previous 14 days granted to them expired before completing investigations. The court heard that detectives are still waiting for DNA results from the government chemist before making a decision on whether to charge the suspect with murder or to release him. The magistrate said the prosecution is unsure whether it has evidence to prefer against the suspect until it gets the DNA results. The deceased worked as a switchboard operator at the Nation Media Group, seconded by Foresight company. She was last seen with Ochieng as he drove her to hospital. Odira disappeared on January 29 and her body was found at City Mortuary six days later with injuries to her head, abdomen and legs. Click here for the latest political news
