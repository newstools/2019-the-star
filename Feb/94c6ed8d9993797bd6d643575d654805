Wrangling between various factions at the LSK intensified yesterday ahead of today’s emergency meeting. The meeting seeks to iron out sharp differences that emerged between LSK membership over the search for a male representative to the Judicial Service Commission. The feud comes even as a section of members seek to push out LSK President Allen Gichuhi. On Friday, Gichuhi said three senior counsel will give guidance on the controversial matter following flawed vetting exercise. On November 13, last year, LSK called for eligible candidates to apply for the position. Applications from Alex Gatundu, Tom Ojienda, Macharia Njeru and Charles Ongoto were received. Gathii Irungu made the application on December 11, a day after deadline. “Tom Ojienda had submitted a court order, regarding his dispute with KRA,” Gichuhi said. The society formed committee comprising senior counsel Prof Kameri Mbote, Kenneth Akide and Joyce Majiwa, IEBC and secretariat to vet the candidates.
