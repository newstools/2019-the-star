A 13-year-old girl from Kitaima village in Bomet East constituency is recuperating in hospital after she was raped by a gang of 10 criminals on Saturday. The victim is currently receiving treatment at Longisa Referral Hospital. Bomet sub county police commander Geoffrey Walumbe said they were following leads which would assist in arresting the culprits. He said already one boda-boda rider has been arrested and is assisting police with the investigation. The girl had been sent to a nearby shopping centre by her mother at around 7 pm on Saturday when the gang pounced on her. “Our men are on the ground pursuing investigations to ensure that the victim gets justice,” Walumbe said. Medical Service and Public Health CEC Dr Joseph Sitonik said the girl was undergoing treatment and is responding well but she has to undergo counselling following the incident. Kitaima residents said the gang had been terrorising them for months. “They are feared by locals and no one will dare to report them to police for fear of reprisal. The gang hides behind the boda boda business,” said a local who sought anonymity. Click here for the latest political news
