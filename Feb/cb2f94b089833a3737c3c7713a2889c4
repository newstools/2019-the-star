Squatters in Cherangany, Trans Nzioa, are bitter with the government for delaying their resettlement. Some 120 families are encamped in makeshift shelters at Bonde in Trans Nzoia East. They complain that the land they were offered for resettlement has not been demarcated. Their chairman, Reuben Kebo, told journalists on Saturday they live in deplorable conditions. “The kind of the environment that we have been subjected to is not conducive for any human being. The population is growing and families are fighting over space in the temporary houses which are dilapidated,” he said. Kebo said the tents they were given two years ago are worn out and they fear for their lives when the rainy season starts. He said poverty had led to teenage pregnancies and many girls have been forced to leave school. He urged the government to consider their plight and demarcate the land they were given to cultivate and transform their lives. He said the land falls under four farms with a total of 300 acres. The squatters were moved to Bonde as internally displaced persons in 2012 from Patakwa farm in Mt Elgon. They were displaced during the 2007/2008 post-election violence. From Patakwa farm, the group briefly settled at the Kitale ASK showground before they were returned to Patakwa by the government.Later, the government bought the land in Bonde to resettle them. Trans Nzoia East deputy county commissioner Abed Malwa said the land was about to be demarcated. He said the physical plan had been completed. “Each squatter will get their portion and title deed once the surveying is completed,” he said.
