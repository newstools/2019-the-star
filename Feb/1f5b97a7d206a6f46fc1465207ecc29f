The woman who was arrested filming traffic officers harassing a female passenger in Nairobi on Tuesday will not be charged. The DPP at Makadara court yesterday rejected the charges pressed against her. The prosecution said the woman had not committed any crime. “We cannot charge anyone just because the police have arrested her filming them do their work. We rejected the file since it is not a crime to take film in the public,” one of the prosecutors told the Star. She said police need to have enough evidence to warrant the prosecution of an accused. We don’t want to take cases in court without evidence or the ones the court might reject, she added. She said DPP Noordin Haji has called for the file. Sophia Njeri was arrested and later released on a police bail of Sh10,000. She was to appear yesterday at the court for plea taking on charges of obstruction of Justice. Njeri filmed the officers pulling a woman from the front seat of a matatu on the Kasarani- Nairobi CBD route. When the officers learnt she was recording, they are seen threatening her but she continued filming. The video went viral. On Tuesday, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority condemned the arrest, adding that they had raised the matter with Kasarani police station. Click here for the latest political news
