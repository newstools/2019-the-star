Moringa School on Tuesday awarded the Inaugural Kenyan Coders Tuition Scholarship to Wilstan Onditi, one of the best science students in last year’s KCSE exams. Moringa School is an intensive tech education program offering a five-week prep and five-month course. It is a world-class coding accelerator with a direct education to the employment model. The focus is to enable a whole generation of high-potential, pro-active young people who are passionate about technology. Half of the ten scholarships for 2019 are designated for students living in informal settlement areas around the city. The school is looking to roll out the scholarship across the country in the near future. "Inclusivity is something that is key to Moringa's operations. In order to reach our goal of transforming Kenya and eventually, the continent, it is important for us to break down the barriers to quality higher education," said Nelly Agyemang-Gyamfi, Senior Access Manager at Moringa School. Kibra MP Ken Okoth commended the school for the initiative. "We are delighted that the Moringa school, known for producing young Software Developers, has chosen to invest in our students. This Scholarship is an excellent launch pad for our best students as they prepare to launch their tech careers in universities locally and internationally.” The move will see students with grades as low as D and E join tertiary institutions, government partly paying their fees and just like their university counterparts they will access loans to cater for the remaining fees. Ministry of education estimates this to cost about Sh20 billion. This means those headed to TVET institutions will access higher education for free. The school fees in TVET institutions currently stands at Sh56,420. Read More: Students in college to study for ‘free’, state to pay tuition Click here for the latest political news
