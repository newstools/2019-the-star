A Baringo family has resorted to burying the hand left behind after their 11-year-old son was attacked by a hippo in Lake Baringo last month. The family lost hope after a two-week search and decided to bury the boy’s right hand in Forest village, Baringo North subcounty, on Saturday.

Since all efforts bore no fruit, we had no other option than to bury the hand,” the father, David Kiplagat, said. Kemboi's grandfather, Charles Chelagat, was also attacked and killed by a hippo in 1993. Kemboi and his friends had gone to fetch water on January 27 when a hippo attacked him, bit off his hand and threw it on the shore. The boy was a Standard Five pupil at Kapsoi Primary School. Deputy head teacher Reuben Kapkiai eulogized Kemboi as clever and hardworking. Mourners who attended the funeral called for the family to be compensated. They also called for piped water. “We also want a Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) post installed at Kampi ya Samaki so the officers can hold constant security patrols around the lake,” resident Charles Muchinga said. He said residents would kill crocodiles and hippos and feast on them if their concerns are not addressed. Saimo-Soi assistant county commissioner Mohamed Sheh said action will be taken to curb attacks. Click here for the latest political news
