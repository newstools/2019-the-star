Health workers in Gilgil Subcounty Hospital say mentally ill patients are increasingly abandoned at the facility. The hospital has 50 patients. It is the second-largest mental institution after Mathari Hospital Teaching and Referral Hospital in Nairobi. Staff workers said the number of abandoned patients is increasing by the day. The hospital is unable to care for them because of lack of facilities and an inadequate budget. The hospital has been turned into a dumping ground by relatives who leave the patients there for good. A senior health worker, who declined to be named, yesterday said a majority of the patients are elderly. Some cannot remember their where their homes are. “This is the second largest mental institution, facilities are archaic and we need a modern unit,” he said. He said the facility is overstretched and many patients share beds, despite their medical conditions. “They have to share the little space we have since we cannot chase them out of the hospital,” he said. Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui on Wednesday said he has held talks with Health CS Sicily Kariuki about the institution. The county has set aside Sh40 million to modernise it. The county chief said they were seeking a special allocation from the national government to treat the growing number of psychiatric patients. Click here for the latest political news
