The government has released Sh5 billion for the purchase of 2 million bags of maize from farmers by the National Cereals and Produce Board. Chairman of the Strategic Food Reserves Fund Noah Wekesa says the board will only be able to buy 2 million bags out of the more than 40 million bags produced by farmers. “We are only buying maize for strategic reserves so that when we have calamities like famine we can be able to feed our people,” Wekesa said. He was  was speaking at the NCPB depot in Eldoret on Friday. Wekesa said due diligence will be followed in the process of paying farmers. “We are thinking that we will pay after every two weeks, but I can assure farmers that they will be happy this time,” Wekesa said.
