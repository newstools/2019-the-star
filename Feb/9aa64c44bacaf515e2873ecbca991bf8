Past winners headline the cast for the sixth edition of the Mau-Egerton Cross Country set February 9 at the Egerton University grounds in Njoro, Nakuru County with organisers targeting over 5,000 participants. Bernard Kipkemoi (men) and Caroline Chepkoech (women), who won the 2015 and 2016 editions respectively are among the top runners expected. And with the World Cross Country trial set for February 23 in Eldoret, some elite athletes are expected to use this year’s Egerton-Mau race as part of their preparations as they seek a slot in Team Kenya to the World Cross Country Championships set for March 30 in Aarhus, Denmark. The race got a boost following APA Insurance’s partnership for a sixth consecutive year, with the company injecting Sh300,000. “We are committed to protecting and conserving the environment and we are happy to have been the event sponsors since its inception. Our objective is to plant and maintain at least 1,000 trees every year,” said APA Insurance Nakuru Branch manager Meena Shah when she presented the sponsorship cheque to Egerton University Vice Chancellor, Prof Rose Mwonya. Participants will compete in 10km for both senior men and women as well as 8km for juniors with winners receiving Sh50,000 prize money. Other events lined up include a 4km race for corporate teams, Egerton university alumni and men over 45 years, 2km race for women above 35 years and children between 5yrs and 8yrs and 1km race for class 1-4 pupils and Egerton university staff above 55years. The Mau-Egerton University Cross country was created to raise funds for rehabilitation of Mau ecosystem and Njoro River which feeds many residents in the community. River Njoro, christened Ndarugu River, is the main feeder to Lake Nakuru. Over the past five years, APA has also partnered with Egerton University to plant indigenous trees at the Ngongeri Park as part of restoration of the riparian forest vegetation along the middle section along Njoro River.
