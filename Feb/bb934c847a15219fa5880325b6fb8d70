Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr yesterday said he will take on KWS rangers suspected of killing a Form 4 student at Tsavo West National park. “I’m waiting for their arrest so that we meet face-to-face in court. They must explain why they killed a boy who cannot carry the weight of a gun,” he said. Benedict Kyule was shot dead on February 15. A postmortem at Makindu Subcounty Hospital last week showed the 17-year-old died of excessive bleeding from gunshot wounds. The bullets entered through his chest, damaging his lungs and main artery. “The velocity of the bullets that went through the chest led to the collapse of the lungs. What followed was excessive bleeding. The chest cavity was filled with blood. This is what killed him,” Makindu medical superintendent Kasanga David said. The postmortem results also indicated the boy was shot four times; two at close range. Kyule was buried on Saturday at his father’s farm in Mang’elete village, Kibwezi East. His parents rejected plans by the community to hold demos on the burial day. Kyule was a KCSE candidate at Kiuani Secondary School. “It is wrong for someone to think that animals have more value than human beings,” Mutula said. He told the Star he will support any action the community will take to protect themselves against abuse by the rangers. The senator said he is in talks with Interior CS Fred Matiang’i, DCI George Kinoti and DPP Noordin Haji to ensure Kyule’s family gets justice. Kyule’s father, John Kioko, said his son used to help him water vegetables on his farm. Kyule’s classmates eulogised him as humble and hardworking. They saidhe never argued with anyone. Neighbours said the boy would sometimes skip classes to look for money to pay his school fees.
