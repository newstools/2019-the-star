Rufftone says marrying his best friend helped keep their union together. "I find it easier to work with my wife, more so because we are in the same industry," Rufftone told Word Is last week. Rufftone and Krystal (Susan Njoki) tied the knot at the Kenya Assemblies of God, Buru Buru, four years ago, and are blessed with one child. "I am enjoying my marriage to this lady God has blessed me with because I don't know if there is anyone else who would be able to handle Rufftone," he said. "She has a strong personality. She is my friend and therefore, we understand each other and sacrifice for each other." Rufftone said his wife is cautious and thatÂ "keeps me in check."
