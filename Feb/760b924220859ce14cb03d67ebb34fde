A class six pupil on Friday evening drowned at a Dam in Musikoma ward, Bungoma County. The 10-year-old boy was swimming with his colleagues when the incident occurred. Residents blamed the county government for negligence at the dam. Elijah Buteyo, a teacher, told the Star that the dam has previously claimed other lives and demanded action be taken. "Many of our people have died. We need action now or we shall open the dam to save our people," he said. Wafula Muyala, a resident, said that it was time for an AP camp to be constructed near the dam to secure saying it will prevent loss of lives. The body of the deceased was taken to the Bungoma hospital mortuary. Namasanda sub-chief Josephat Khamala warned residents that they will take legal action against parents who allow their children to loiter around the dam. He added that security measures, including fencing of the dam, will be put in place to prevent more deaths. Click here for the latest political news
