Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana on Sunday visited ODM chief Raila Odinga at his Karen home amid the wrangling in his Wiper Party. Without giving details, Raila tweeted about their meeting, indicating that they discussed the state of devolution "and related national issues." It was not immediately clear what were among the national issues they discussed, and if the squabbling the Kalonzo Musyoka-led party formed part of the issues. Kibwana is Wiper's chairman. He tweeted, "Makueni County’s @governorkibwana called on me at my Karen home this morning for a discussion on the state of devolved governments and other related national issues." Governor Kibwana alongside his Ukambani colleagues; Machakos' Alfred Mutua and Kitui's Charity Ngilu have been on the warpath with Kalonzo and the Wiper Party. Mutua and Ngilu were elected of the Maendeleo Chap Chap and Narc party tickets, respectively. They accuse Kalonzo of "monarchical hold" of the region and have said that his time is up.
