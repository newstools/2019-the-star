A 95-year-old grandmother was raped and killed in Githunguri last week. The crime was committed in Raiyani village in Kwa maiko area. The woman, Peninah Njoki, may also have been doused in acid. Her daughter-in-law, Edith Njeri, said that after church on Sunday, she visited a neighbour but did not return. Some children later called Njeri to go to the riverside and see what was happening. She found Njoki lying dead with deep scratches all over her body. She appeared to have been raped. “I was shocked to find my mother (in law) dead. She was light-skinned but she was all dark, as if she had been burnt. I fear she might have been raped due to the position I found her in. She had scratches on the face and backside,” Njeri said. She said Peninah used to visit all homes in the neighborhood and she was loved by her neighbours and had no enemies. “My mother is loved by fellow villagers as she was used to visiting them and they would also treat her well. I wonder who would do the heinous act on a harmless old woman,” Njeri said. Stephen Ngotho, Peninah’s son, said the police collected the body and no one had been arrested. The family is awaiting a postmortem.
