The DCI is investigating corruption claims at the ongoing gun licensing verification process. This comes after activist Boniface Mwangi shared on Twitter a complaint raised by one private gun owner. "Bonnie you should tweet that there is corruption at the gun verification vetting at CID," the tweet said. "Files are disappearing until you remove Sh1000. mzungus (Whites) and muhindi's (Asians) are allowed to keep all their weapons as Africans who have gone through several trainings are being stressed." In a quick rejoinder, the DCI firmly stated they are looking into the matter and asked the public to reach out with any more information that could help with the investigations. "Good afternoon @bonifacemwangi. We have received this complaint and are currently investigating the matter... Thank you," DCI said.
