Upper Hill High School has revived its old boys’ association. At a special annual general meeting held on Saturday, Robert Yawe was elected chairman and Stephen Keya vice chairman. Nicholas Kangeth’e is the new secretary, Kangesa Owuor (assistant secretary), Stephen Makau (treasurer) and Stephen Lamba (assistant treasurer). Committee members are Dick Omondi, Kiryungi Gathogo, Alex Kamau and Franklin Juma. Yawe said former Upper Hill students should be proud of their school and step out to give back. The boys’ boarding school was established in 1956 and was initially named Delamere School after British settler Lord Delamere. The members resolved to offer mentorship to current students, improve facilities for nurturing and mentoring talent, support ongoing projects and provide internship to form four leavers. They will also support the endowment fund, improve teachers and workers’ welfare and actively participate in the Board of Management. Click here for the latest political news
