Nairobi City Stars assistant coach John Amboko is confident of halting their four-match win-less run when they confront a promotion chasing Ushuru in the 16th round of the National Super League today at Camp Toyoyo. The former Kenyan Premier League outfit have recorded three one-all draws against Thika United, Administration Police and Nairobi Stima before losing 2-1 to FC Talanta in their last four matches but Amboko is hopeful they will overpower the tax men and arrest their poor run. Similarly, Ushuru have also stretched their win-less run to four matches following their 2-1 loss to Talanta and draws to Kisumu All Stars(1-1), St Joseph Youth (0-0) and Coast Stima(1-1) which have seen them fall five points behind league leaders Wazito. Ahead of the match, Amboko counts on his players to deliver the win which will see them stretch their tally to 14 points and scale past the red-line as the club currently sits 17 on the log. “We have not been doing good of late but today we will give our best and stop the taxmen. I have talked to the boys and we have resolved to solely go for the three points.” In other matches, Thika United will be eying recovery following their Monday 3-1 loss to Wazito when the host Shabana at the Thika Sub-County Stadium. The former Kenya Premier League side who are under the tutelage of Gabriel Kingi sit 12th with 19 points while Shabana, who thrashed Green Commandos 7-2 are placed seventh with 22 points. Kingi cited lack of funds as Thika’s main undoing, saying theyb hardly train as a unit in readiness for their matches. Kibera Black Stars will be hoping to register their third win of the season when they play third placed and a unbeaten Nairobi Stima at Camp Toyoyo. Kibera upset Administration Police 2-1 in their previous match to rise to 16th with 11 points and will be out to end replicate the same and scale to a safer rank.
