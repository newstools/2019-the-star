Nyeri town traders have raised concerns over increased robbery. On Sunday night, several outlets were broken into. Cash and goods were stolen. Investigations are underway. Cyber cafe owner Maina Ndung’u was one of the victims. His electronics were stolen. The robbers also took the Sh800 that was left in his cash box. In another store, the burglars drank soda and left empty bottles. “We’ve been reporting all the incidents to the police, but no action has been taken to intensify patrols to prevent further theft or have the criminals arrested,” Ndung’u said. One trader lost wheat flour, cash, cooking oil and a gas cylinder. In December, several businesses were raided. Traders lost Sh300,000 and goods. Ndung’u called for action to stop investors from fleeing. “We even fear to invest more money as our stock may be stolen. Some of us are contemplating leaving the town to invest elsewhere,” Ndung’u said. Nyeri police boss Paul Kuria said they will increase patrols and warned residents against idling near businesses, especially those at the town’s bus park. “Some people pretending to be touts at the upper bus park are the ones who go back to steal from the shops at night. We’re in the process of clearing them from that stage,” he said.
