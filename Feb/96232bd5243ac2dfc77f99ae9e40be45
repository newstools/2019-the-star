Three murder suspects were on Friday released after a bizarre mix-up at the Uasin Gishu County cells. They walked to freedom in a case of mistaken identity after they were mixed up with petty offenders. Eldoret South OCPD Wilson Abduba said the murder suspects were transferred together with the petty offenders from Langas police station to the county courts. He said the three were then released with the petty offenders and walked free, unnoticed. Abduba, however, said DCI officers have launched manhunt for the escapees. The incident comes on the day an Eldoret court sentenced a man to 15 years in jail after he was found guilty of being an al Shabaab member. Chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa said Ramadhan Adam Athman was found in possession of a mobile phone with videos, images and articles on terrorism. Athman was found in possession of the material in Kipkaren area, Uasin Gishu county, on June 16, 2016. He was also found guilty of being in possession of bhang.
