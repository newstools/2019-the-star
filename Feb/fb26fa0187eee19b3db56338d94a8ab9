Tourism Cabinet secretary Najib Balala has challenged coast counties to resolve the 40 year beach boys menace if they want to reap from beach tourism. The Kenyan coastline has five major beach destinations in Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale and Lamu Counties but beach boys have dominated the beaches harassing tourists.The coastline is believed to hold about 10,000 beach boys from Lamu in the north, to Diani in south coast. “Our plan is to define the coast and market the beach destination as a distinct product. To enable us, not only increase the numbers, but improve on the clients’ experiences,” said Balala during the Coast Tourism Stakeholders Summit at Neptune Hotel at Diani.. “County governments must come up with strategies to ensure these individuals get employment so that they do not go around chasing after our guests,” he said. The newly established Coast Beach Destination Working Group, chaired by Pride Inn Managing Director Hasnain Noorani, will come up with a strategy paper on resolving issues facing the sector. “We only need political goodwill and affirmative action to address youth unemployment at the coast. The county government must also come up with policies that govern this sector,” said Sam Ikwaye, coast executive director of Kenya Association of Hoteliers and Caterers. “It is time for us to start destination marketing. We have seen other countries doing it well, Morocco markets Marrakesh, South Africa markets Cape Town, Mexico markets Cancún and even our neighbours Tanzania market Zanzibar,” said the CS. Ministry of Tourism has developed a Kenya Tourisms Blueprint 2030 which is anchored on four key pillars including product development strategy, marketing strategy, investment strategy and tourism infrastructure strategy.
