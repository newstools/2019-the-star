Fresh from a dominant victory against bitter rivals Impala last weekend, Quins turn their attention to the Ngong Warriors in the first round of the Enterprise Cup at the RFUEA ground today. Quins start the match as overwhelming favourites as they seek to progress to the pre-quarter final where holders Homeboyz RFC lay in wait. Charles Cadovillis will ring the changes in the Match Day 23 and keep his big guns fresh for the Kenya Cup clash against league leaders Kabras next weekend. Traditionally, the Enterprise Cup is played after the end of the Kenya Cup season but has been brought forward this year to run alongside the league. Quins will rely on the fringe players in the squad and will see the likes of Edward Oseko, Elijah Koronya, Melvin Thairu, Dan Suchi, Matt Wanjia and Jasper Ochen alongside Frank Wanyama start for the home side. Assistant coach Benjamin Ayimba said they are taking the competition seriously and want to go on good run in the competition. “It’s a chance of winning silverware and we want to go all the way. We have not won it in long time so we must be at our best to win it,” added Ayimba. The tactician said they will not underestimate their opponents for the match. “We don’t know anything about Ngong Warriors but this being a knockout competition, we have to treat them with the utmost respect and be competitive,” he added.
