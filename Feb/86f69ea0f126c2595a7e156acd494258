An angry mob on Thursday lynched a man linked to the gang that killed a woman and gang-raped her three granddaughters in Litein, Bomet county. The suspect was beaten and lynched after he was found in possession of a mobile phone that belonged to the deceased. "The man was positively identified by one of the granddaughters. He lives a few kilometres from their house," a witness told the Star on Thursday. Other witnesses said the suspect confessed that he was part of the four-member gang who committed the crime after he was positively identified. After the incident, Kapsoit MCA Paul Chirchir and other leaders demanded an overhaul of the entire security team in Kericho county. County police commander James Rugera confirmed the incident and said the man's body has been transferred to the Kapkatet Hospital mortuary. Earlier, DCI detectives arrested a man believed to be part of the gang. The 30-year-old suspect was arrested and positively identified by three victims of the attack.
