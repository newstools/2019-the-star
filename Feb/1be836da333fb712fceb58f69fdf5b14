An international water association delegation is touring the region to assess its ability to host the 2021 IDA World Water Congress. The International Desalination Association delegation landed on Thursday. The team is led by IDA secretary general Shannon McCarthy. They toured several beach hotels in Mombasa and Fort Jesus in Old Town. Mombasa has been shortlisted among four world cities to host the 2021 IDA World Water Congress. It is a biennial meeting widely recognised as the premier global event on desalination and water reuse. Also shortlisted to host the congress are Melbourne and Sydney in Australia and Daegu in South Korea. If Mombasa wins the bid, it will be the first time the congress will be held in Africa. It was started in 1985 and has been hosted in 17 cities in 12 non-African countries. “We are glad to be here in Mombasa, we have toured several areas to see if the region matches the requirements we need to host an IDA Congress,” McCarthy said. The congress is expected to bring together more than 2,500 global experts on water desalination. Mombasa Deputy Governor William Kingi said the conference will not only be about the water desalination, but the country will earn foreign exchange from the thousands of delegates attending. “This also boost tourism, because all guests will need accommodation and they will tour attractions,” he said.
