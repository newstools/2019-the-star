A tout was on Monday stabbed to death by unknown assailants at a bar in Kasarani during a party organised by his girlfriend. Job Misati, who worked with ZamZam Sacco, had attended a party organised by his girlfriend only identified as Liz at Piper's pub. Five men entered the pub at 3am and confronted Misati before killing him. They did not injure anyone else and Misati's friends who attended the party say they suspect the woman is behind the murder. â€œAll was well until at some point when his [Misati's] girlfriend started behaving funny then a group of five people came and killed him instantly. They didn't harm the lady as she vanished from the scene. We could not react by then," one of Misatis' friends told the Star. The touts mourned Misati as a hardworking colleague who was focused. His body was taken to Nairobi City Mortuary. Police said investigations into the killing are ongoing. Click here for the latest political news
