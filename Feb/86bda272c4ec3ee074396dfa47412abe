Homeboyz winger Cyprian Kuto has been ruled out of the Vancouver and Las Vegas Sevens tournament next month. Kuto sustained a knee injury in Sydney and has been advised by the medical team to sit out the next two legs by the mediacl staff. Kuto joins Quins fullback William Reeves, who has a similar injury, on the sidelines. Former Kenya Sevens utility back Michael Agevi and KCB’s Peter Kilonzo will most likely be considered for the North American trip owing to the two injuries. Agevi, a younger brother to Collins Injera and Humphrey Kayange, had a stint with the team between 2012-2015 but shoulder and knee injuries have limited his playing time in the last three years. The team resumed training yesterday after a one week break and team manager Eric Ogweno said it will be crush training programme to correct the errors from Sydney, where the team lost all five matches on tour. “We only have seven to eight days of training before we travel to Las Vegas. It’s short training period and the boys have to adjust accordingly,” added Ogweno. He said kickoffs and defence patterns will be the priority areas this time round. “This two areas have been our biggest headache this season especially with new young players learning. We hope as the season progresses, we can get better,” he added. Ogweno is confident that the the young side will not be relegated at the end of the season. “The boys are showing improvement and with a bit of game management and good defence then we will survive,” added Ogweno. Kenya face USA, Argentina, and France in Pool ‘B’ in sand Ogweno noted picking 8-10 points will be the target for the reminder of the season. “ We don’t want to burden this young team with high expectations if we can get points in the challenge trophy it will be good for this team as they grow in the circuit,” added Ogweno. The team is expected to be named next week and will depart the country on February 23.
