Three senior City Hall employees have been accused of conspiring to defraud the county government of Sh7.3 million. Finance chief officer Stephen Mutua, accountant David Wambugu and deputy chief finance officer Johnson Abwori were arrested yesterday and taken to court. Police sought to detain them for five days to complete investigations but magistrate Peter Ooko declined to issue the order. He said the state failed to give compelling reasons why they should be detained. Ooko said they can be released on Sh200,000 bail. They were ordered to be reporting to DCI-City Hall daily. The case will be mentioned on March 5. Court documents show the suspects conspired with the directors of M/s Nunguni General Suppliers to defraud the county government of Sh7,396,552.
