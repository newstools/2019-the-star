Upper Hill’s skyscraper dotted neighbourhood has cemented its place among the world’s most notable architecture pieces after Britam Tower received the Emporis Skyscraper Award. This is a first for a building in Africa in the decade old awards. The building, developed by Britam Properties, is also the tallest building in East and Central Africa, standing at 200 metres. It sits on a 1.5 acre piece of land, and has two buildings, including a 15 floor parking lot and 31 storey office tower. Winners of the The Emporis Skyscraper Award are chosen by a jury of architecture experts from all over the world, while the nominated buildings are judged based on their achievements in functions and aesthetics. “The building had to make sound commercial sense to the investor and tenants alike and add value to the precinct in which it is situated,” Triad Architects said in a statement. It said the theme of a multi-tenanted iconic office building that embodies the qualities of strength and stability, is timeless and ages gracefully is well captured in the building. Traid said the tower also serves as an inspirational and environmentally responsible place, both inside and out.
