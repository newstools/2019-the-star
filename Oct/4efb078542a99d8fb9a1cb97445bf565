Two receptionists at a gym were on Monday charged with stealing more than Sh1.4 million from their employer in Pumwani, Eastleigh. Emily Achieng and Priscah Musembi, alongside Eunice Atieno who is still at large, allegedly stole Sh1,496,240 from the owner of Fitness Training Centre between January and September. They denied the charges before Makadara principal magistrate Steven Jalang'o and were granted Sh200,000 bail each, pending the hearing of the case next year in February. They are accused of stealing by failure to drop the levies collected from clients into the cash box, fraudulent diversion of funds and falsification of records. According to the prosecution, the suspects were stealing money by writing different M-Pesa deposits.Â  The director, who had been away, later noticed the gym was not doing well. It was incurring losses. After investigating, he found the accused were stealing from the business. He reported to the Pangani police station. Edited by R.Wamochie
