The Employment and Labour Relations Court has suspended the appointment of former Othaya MP Mary Wambui as chairperson of the National Employment Authority. This is after Kenya Young Parliamentarians Association moved to court to block the former legislator from taking office. Justice Hellen Wasilwa on Wednesday allowed their application and suspended the gazette notice that appointed her into office. “That interim orders suspending the implementation of the appointment of Mary Wambui are granted pending the hearing of the application,” the judge noted. The case will be mentioned on November 14 for interparty hearing. In the case, KYPA argues that the qualifications of a person to be appointed the chairperson of the authority are provided in the National Employment Authority Act. It provides that one should have at least seven years' experience in Human Resource Management or its equivalent. They claim Wambui is not qualified under the law, policy and best practice, adding that the qualifications are mandatory. “The impugned directive of appointing Wambui is not only retrogressive, arbitrary and stale but also attempts to uncharacteristically undermine the principles of public participation and guiding principles of leadership,” their petition reads. Through lawyer Duncan Akhulia, they allege that Wambui has - on several occasions - personally admitted that she possesses a limited educational background "which makes her unqualified and unsuitable to conduct the affairs of the Authority". They add, “...appointing her will disfranchise the Kenyan taxpayer given the very strategic nature of the position..." They further said there is no other law upon which the Labour CS can base his decision to appoint Wambui other than the provisions the National Employment Authority Act. Edited by R.Wamochie
