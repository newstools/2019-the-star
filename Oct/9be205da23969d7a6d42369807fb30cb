Petroleum and Mining CS John Munyes has extended the appointment of Hudson Andambi as the acting managing director of the Kenya Pipeline Company until the firm finds a substantive head. The CS, in a statement on Friday, said his decision was reached after wide consultation, giving the board enough time to continue with the ongoing recruitment. Munyes said Andambi has made tremendous progress in revenue collection since he was appointed. The board and the entire KPC management team have been asked to give Andambi full support in the office. This is the second time Andambi's appointment is being extended. Andambi's appointment was to run until October 6. The CS said the company has put in place measures intended to streamline the procurement process and the restructuring of the company's human resource. Andambi was named as the interim managing director of KPC in December 2018. This followed after the arrest of then MD Joe Sang and other top managers on allegations of corruption.
