A date has been confirmed for Eliud Kipchoge's INEOS 1:59 Challenge in Vienna, Austria. The challenge will take place this Saturday. The final start time will be confirmed on Friday afternoon by the INEOS 1:59 Performance and Meteorology teams. Robby Ketchell, who is leading the weather analysis for the INEOS 1:59 Challenge Performance Team, said they have looked at the weather patterns for Vienna coming through and the current conditions are looking to be optimal for temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation for this Saturday morning. "We are currently looking at less than 2 m/s wind speed on the start location on the bridge and a temperature of between 5-9 degrees Celcius from 5AM-8AM on Saturday. After 8am, the temperature is looking like it will rise slightly, and humidity will drop slightly. For the Challenge we need a 24-hour window of no rain to keep all the surfaces dry and that is currently looking to be the case for Saturday too," Robby Ketchell said He added, “Weather analysis, as one part of the Challenge we cannot control, has been the subject of much hard work from the team over the past few months and with the best knowledge we have right now Saturday 12th October is looking to be the best conditions we could have hoped for.” Kipchoge will be attempting to run under two hours in a 42km race. The Olympic marathon champion left for Vienna on Monday night aboard Sir Jim’s Gulfstream G280, which was flown by two pilots from his British base to fly Kipchoge to the Austrian capital. He arrived in the Austrian capital on Tuesday and was delighted and looking forward to the historical event. "I am very excited to be here in Vienna. I have now seen the course for the first time and it looks great. I can't wait to run on it and hopefully I will see you all there this weekend," noted Kipchoge. The INEOS 1:59 Challenge will be streamed live by YouTube on the INEOS 1:59 Challenge page.
