Fast-rising stars Ochungulo family say they have just started and aren't ready to change their tone. Speaking to Word Is on Tuesday, two members of the group, Benzema and Nelly The Goon, said contrary to reports, Gengetone is not ending anytime soon. "When we started, we didn't know we were going to come this far. Even though many of us are doing this genre, we are here to stay. Our industry is not saturated. As you've seen, Kenyans are now playing our own, thanks to Gengetone," they said on Tuesday. The genre has, however, been criticised for vulgar language. "As much as our kind of music sells, we have our own audience, the people who want to listen to that kind of content," Nelly said. "Through this music, we've also been able to pay a whole year's fees for Happiness, the girl who came with the slang 'Mbingijii imekulwa na ndongii'." Benzema said on a lighter note that he wanted to view for MCA in Lang'ata in 2022. "I will vie in 2022. When that happens, I'll legalise weed," he said. The group will be performing in Nakuru this weekend for Kenya Cane Mashujaa party. "Let's party together and if you have talent, feel free to come to the event and talk to us. We are willing to hold your hand. In fact, we are looking for a vocalist,"Â  Nelly The Goon said.
