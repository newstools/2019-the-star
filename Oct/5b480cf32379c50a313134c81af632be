Police in Embu are hunting for a suspected thug who broke into an 80-year-old womanâ€™s house while it rained heavily and raped her. The woman was allegedly raped at Ngerwe village in Embu North subcounty on Thursday night at around 3am as it rained. The woman reported the matter to Kibugu police post. Police visited her home and commenced investigations. Embu North subcounty police boss Ben Murilo confirmed the incident, saying the octogenarian was shocked to realise the man was already in her semi-permanent house moments before he raped her and escaped. He said they are carrying out investigations to try and arrest the suspect so as to prosecute him. The woman said after eating supper she went to sleep and that later in the night it started raining heavily. She said as she slept the man broke the door into her house but owing to the loud noise caused by the rain on the roof, relatives and neighbours did not hear anything as he broke the door. The elder said she tried to scream but the man held her by the neck and threatened to kill her if she refused to cooperate. She said the man raped her and escaped while it still rained before she alerted relatives and neighbours about her ordeal. The granny reported the matter to the Kibugu police post which is under Manyatta police station. She was issued with a note to seek treatment at a public hospital before she could be issued with a P3 form as the police started investigations.
