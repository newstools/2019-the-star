Uasin Gishu and Nandi Counties will mount big screens in strategic points in Kapsabet and Eldoret towns to stream live the Eliud Kipchoge’s INEOS 1:59 Challenge in Vienna, Austria on this morning. In Eldoret Town, a big screen, which is used to advertise various county services will be used to view the race as world marathon record holder seeks to run under two hours in Vienna. The same mega screen, located between the Eldoret-Uganda Highway and Eldoret-Iten road, has been in use for the past three years for public viewing including all World Marathon Majors. In Nandi, the county government will install three viewing points for the INEOS Challenge among them Kipchoge’s home in Kapsisiwa Village. “The county government of Nandi through the sports department will set up two screens to enable Nandi residents to watch the world’s greatest marathoner Kipchoge making history in Vienna. The first screen will be set up at the Sports department grounds while the other will be erected at Kipchoge’s home village in Kapsisiwa,” according to Nandi County sports department headed by Elly Kurgat. “The Department of Sports invites athletes and residents of Nandi to witness the historic moment,” added Kurgat. This will be the second time the Olympic marathon winner will be attempting the sub 2 hours in history. He tried in 2017 at the Monza in Italy, where he ran 2:00.25—missing the Under-2 hours mark by 26 seconds.
