A man accused of using contemptuous language against Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok on his social media page was on Tuesday charged in a Bomet court. Dominic Kiplangat, 31, was charged with two counts of publishing obscene information in electronic media and undermining the authority of a public officer. The court heard that between September 22 and October 14 within Bomet Central, without lawful excuse published on Facebook "Does your boss knows he is the kabana because of our beloved late mother's death certificate? That he pays now without pain a single conjugal to a tune of Sh2 million." The charge sheet stated that the message was circulated to undermine the lawful authority of Barchok, a public officer. Kiplangat was also charged that during the same period, he posted similar information on his page which were aimed at defaming the governor. The accused was arrested on Monday by detectives from the Bomet DCI office. Appearing before Bomet senior resident magistrate Kipkirui Kibelion, the accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the two charges. His lawyer Geoffrey Kipngetich asked the prosecution to offer him favourable bond terms arguing he was an orphan and a firstborn whom his siblings depended on. "My client lives within the jurisdiction of this court, he is not a flight risk and we are asking that you give reasonable bail or bond," Kipngetich argued. In his ruling, Kibelion released him on a Sh30, 000 cash bail. The case will be mentioned on October 31.
