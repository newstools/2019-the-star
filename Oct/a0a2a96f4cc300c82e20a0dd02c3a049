Nakuru county is targeting 43,000 girls aged 10 years for vaccination against human papillomavirus in October. HPV is sexually transmitted and can cause cervical cancer or genital infections. The vaccine will be given to all girls of 10 years (born in 2009) and will be administered in two doses  six months apart. It will be offered free of charge as part of routine immunisation through public, private, faith-based and NGO-run health facilities. County Health CEC Gichuki Kariuki said his office has already mapped schools close to health facilities to offer the vaccine. “We have mapped out schools to be used as venues to vaccinate the  girls. To achieve the targeted number, we have collaborated with school heads and are now training teachers on the benefits,” said Kariuki. The announcement comes after delays occasioned by opposition from religious groups led by the Catholic Church. The rollout across the country was approved by Parliament two weeks ago and will cost Sh475 million. Kariuki urged residents to ignore rumours about the vaccine. "There is no research evidence that the vaccination is associated with early initiation of sexual activity or risky sexual behaviour," he said. Nakuru chief officer for medical services Solomon Sirma said the county is ready for the HPV vaccination.
