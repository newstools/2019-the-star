Isiolo Governor Mohamed Kuti has urged the state to help the county address the effects of heavy rains. He said Ewaso Nyiro River broke its banks and submerged Iresaboru village. “The roads in the area have been cut off and 10 livestock killed. It's hard to deliver food to the people there,” Kuti said. He spoke after touring the area to access the damage. He said that if the rains continue, other areas will also be affected. The county chief urged the national government to assist his administration airlift food and provide water purification materials. Kuti further appealed to the national government to partner with his administration in the roll out for a countywide Rift Valley fever vaccination to avert the loss of human lives. He urged residents living along river banks to move to higher and safer grounds. Isiolo South MP Abdi Koropu said the only borehole in the area is inaccessible. “Those people need food and mosquito nets and water treatment tabs,” he said.
