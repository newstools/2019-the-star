A Facebook post claiming that the Teachers Service Commission has sacked 36 teachers for professional misconduct is TRUE. The post adds that the information was communicated to the public through a Kenya Gazette notice dated October 4, 2019. The post was shared on the official Teachers Service Commission Twitter and Facebook pages. The commission said that it had deregistered 36 teachers for professional misconduct after a disciplinary process were initiated in conformity with the TSC Act and Code of Regulations for Teachers. Section 30 of the Teachers Service Commission Act gives the commission power to deregister any member who has committed a sexual or criminal offense after an official inquiry. It also stipulates that the names and particulars of any individual removed from the teachers register should be published in a gazette notice 30 days from the date of the official deregistration.
