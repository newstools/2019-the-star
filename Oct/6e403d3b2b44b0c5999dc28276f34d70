Singer Akothee was the talk of the town when she landed in Parliament wearing a short luminous green skirt-suit last month. The singer says given a chance to go back, she would still dress in a similar way. “That was one of my best dress code. We got an email from the PA saying we should wear suits, I wore a suit. My legs are the ones longer than the skirt. If it was worn by another woman, that would have been a maxi to her. When I wake up, I dress according to the occasion.” Adding, “Given a chance back, I will do the same dress code. What shocked me was the fact that people forgot my aim of going to Parliament. They started focusing on my dress code, which doesn’t feed anyone. The people I’m feeding right now in Turkana are actually walking naked. Why isn’t anyone talking about Turkana people who are hungry and naked?” Talking to Willy M Tuva, the Kenyan songstress said she went to Parliament to invite the government to the launch of Akothee Foundation. “I didn’t want my government to be left behind and I got the support needed.” Talking about her manager, Nellyoaks, Akothee said he has been on the low key because of school. “He is doing his master’s right now in international relations. I’m also in school [studying] business management.” AKothee, who is currently making headlines with the song Rollem, rubbished sex tape rumours. “What hurt me was how that video was and where it was shot, in a dirty place. They know I have white bedsheets, they know how my kitchen looks like, they even know how my butt looks like. Why would someone think that was me? “
