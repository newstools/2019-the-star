Transport has been paralyzed in Boni forest villages in Lamu West after river Lagwarera burst its banks and swept away bridges used by residents. Over 1,000 people among them school children and security personnel operating in the areas have been affected by the flooding. Residents of villages inside the Boni forest have since Wednesday been unable to cross over to either side after the floods washed away parts of the Hindi-Kiunga road and several bridges. The road is the only connection between the affected villages and the rest of the county. Security officers stationed in the region have been unable to connect with other units due to impassable roads. Trucks transporting goods to security camps are stuck at the Bodhei junction while others have pitched camp at Mokowe as they wait for the floods to subside before they can proceed. Numerous other trucks transporting construction materials to the Usalama camp where the border wall separating Kenya and Somalia is being built are stuck at Bodhei junction. Mangai, Majengo and Milimani rivers also burst their banks, adding to the havoc. Farmers in the affected areas are counting losses after thousands of acres of crops were swept away by the raging floods. Basuba ward MCA Barissa Deko on Friday urged the government and well-wishers to intervene with humanitarian support to the affected areas. “Transport around all Boni villages is now a nightmare. People are literally on self-curfew in their homes as they can’t leave the villages due to the floods and fact that the bridges have been swept away. Children can’t go to school either. Nothing is happening and we need urgent help,” Barissa said. Parents have called on the government to find ways to ensure KCPE candidates in the affected areas do their exams.
