Installation of footbridges along upgraded Outering Road is in progress as Kenya Urban Roads Authority installs the fifth of 11. For almost 12 hours on Sunday, the Outering Road between Mutindwa Junction and Jogoo Road was partially closed as early as 6am to allow installation of a footbridge near Tena Estate. Kura corporate communications officer John Cheboi told the Star that footbridge would be the fifth in the 13km stretch. "So far we have successfully installed four footbridges which are already open to the public. Another four have already been fixed at strategic places awaiting completion, " he said. The completed footbridges are km 1+ 020 Baba Dogo, km 1+890 Huruma , Km 2 +370 Kariobangi and Km 5+400 Mutindwa. The half-installed footbridges include Km 3+417 Pioneer Estate, Km 8+090 Quarry Road Junction, Km 8+855 Avenue Park and Km 6 +260 Tena estate. The footbridges will ensure the safety of pedestrians who have been dashing across the road, risking injury and death. Pedestrians have been the major cause of accidents. The National Transport and Safety Authority has said the Outering Road is the second most dangerous after Mombasa road in terms of accidents. "Once we complete these footbridges, pedestrians will have no excuse for carelessly crossing the road while footbridges are available," Cheboi said. The 13 km stretch road is also well lighted to improve the vision of motorists and pedestrians at night. The Sh8.5 billion project was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta in January 2015 and is funded by the African Development Bank and the government. The road was supposed to be completed in September 2017 but had been delayed by court cases and other problems. Kura has assured residents the 13km stretch from where Taj Mall stood on North Airport Road to the General Service Unit headquarters in Ruaraka will soon be completed. (Edited by V. Graham)
