New mum Tanasha Donna better not try to keep Diamond Platnumz all to herself because his sister and mother might push her out. She had also better not say too much about her boyfriend. Diamond’s older sister Esma is on record saying she and her mother, Sandra Sunura, have a family rule that if not followed by Diamond’s girlfriends gets them kicked out. And Tanasha is no exception. Esma said she does not allow her younger brother’s girlfriends to get too clingy. “In our home this idea of a woman yearning to close herself off with her man and embrace him in private is not allowed,” Esma said in an interview. She said that’s the reason they plotted to get Hamisa thrown out. Tanasha gave birth to Diamond’s fourth child early this month. The baby boy was born on October 2 and shares a birthday with his father. Diamond has two children with Ugandan socialite Zari Hassan and one with former Miss Tanzania, Hamisa Mobetto.
