Greensharks coach Ben Owaga is already planning for next season despite being four matches away from the season end. After seeing his boys hammer Strathmore University Gladiators 3-1 in a Premier League match on Wednesday at the City Park Stadium, Owaga revealed he wants to sign five new players ahead of next season. Sharks, despite being third on the league, have had problems of their own, both defensively and in attack. They have conceded 22 and scored only 23 goals in 14 matches. Their one goal difference is the least among the top five teams, making Owaga contemplate injecting new blood. "So far so good but we are going to bring in new faces. Two defenders, two strikers and a midfielder will make us stronger and competitive. Actually, I don't expect departures. I just want to increase the competition for places," said Owaga. Sharks bounced back to winning ways after losing two consecutive matches. Owaga complimented the team's effort for taking off the mounting pressure. "I want to thank everyone. It was important to get three points. There was pressure but am happy that never affected us. The boys stood tall and got the job done. It has been a while since we won against Strathmore. This was a big plus and I hope we change tide now. " As for the Gladiators, overall improvement is needed to return the glory days. The former champions have stagnated and with results not so good, Captain Festus Onyango said teamwork is necessary for the fight to maintain their top-flight status. He said: “We just need a reaction from all sections. The defence gave away three easy goals. The midfielders created little chances that the strikers failed to convert. We need to have a spark across the field. It is a wake-up call to the whole team to start delivering.” Strathmore remains eighth with 10 points-two ahead of Sikh Union. With the on- going squad rebuilding, survival is paramount for the students.
