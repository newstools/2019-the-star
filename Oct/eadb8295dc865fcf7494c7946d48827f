Machachari director Mburu Kimaniâ€™s wife Mary Mukiri lost her battle with liver cancer on Tuesday night. She died while undergoing treatment at Texas Cancer Centre on Mbagathi Road. Speaking to Word Is on the phone yesterday, Mburu said, "She was diagnosed with lung cancer six months ago. She died while going through chemotherapy. We don't understand why lung cancer, yet she was a non-smoker." Adding, "It hurts to see someone who was healthy and okay die just like that." Mary's 10-year-old child was an actor in the kids' show 'Machachari'. Many are confusing her with Wanjiku Mburu, who plays the role of Mama Baha on the show. Mburu also said that dealing with a cancer patient isn't easy. "You have to be stronger for them. Cancer leaves one malnourished and drains your pocket," he said. Mary died aged 40. Burial plans are underway at her husband's home.
