Last week, eight winners walked away with smartphones by simply listening to music on the app. Speaking about the promotion on Tuesday, Brian Chege, head of content acquisition and A&R, said fans have a variety of music genres to choose from. "To participate, all you have to do is download Songa, listen to our 2.5 million+ songs and also various playlists, including the celebrity playlists made by our local celebrities. The more you listen, the higher your chances to win a smartphone," he said. Celebrities who have already submitted their playlists on Songa include Kiss breakfast presenters Andrew Kibe and Kamene Goro and Classic 105's Maina Kageni.
