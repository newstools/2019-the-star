Private divers have arrived to join in the search of the bodies of a mother and her daughter who drowned in Likoni, Mombasa. Mariam Kighenda and her four-year-old daughter, Amanda Mutheu died after their car slithered from a ferry into the Indian Ocean. They were coming from a shamba trip in Kwale. The divers were seen preparing to board boats as others combed the waters nearby. Working in pairs of two, the divers were seen preparing ropes that to be used underwater in the event they find the car's occupants. "We are ready to do this. We pray that we get the vehicle today. We are just waiting for low tides so that we get into the water without delay," Diver Susan said. The car plunged 60 metres deep but available machines, according to some sources, can last divers for only half the depth. On Sunday evening, their Toyota ISIS KCB 289C veered off the rear ramp aboard the MV Harambee and sank into the ocean headfirst.
