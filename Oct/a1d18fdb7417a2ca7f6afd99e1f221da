 A man charged with being in possession of 16 rolls of bhang has told the court that an officer attached to Kabete police station is planning to kill him. Ivan Mwangi told Kibera senior principal magistrate Barbara Ojoo the officer threatened to teach him a lesson. “He has just threatened me when we were on a short break outside this court, my honour, for my protection, just note that,” Mwangi said. He said the officer arrested him in a bar in Riruta and took him to Kabete police station. “You arrested me while I was just behind Riruta police station and you decided that I belong to Kabete police station, why did you do that? the accused asked the police officer in court. He claimed the officer did not get his job rightfully, hence the reason he was handling the case in a shoddy manner. “You got your job through corruption means, is it right? Mwangi asked. But the officer, John Maina, said he arrested Mwangi within the required jurisdiction. “I arrested you in a jurisdiction that linked you to Kabete police station. You ought to know the issue to do with boundaries,” Maina said. Mwangi confronted the officer and asked him not to joke with him because he was born in Riruta and knows its boundaries better. The accused also took issue with police statements that indicated he was a boy. “My honour, they call me a boy yet I am an old man,” he said. He said it was wrong for the officer to fix the charges on him alone yet he was arrested together with other suspects. The magistrate confirmed that the accused person was arrested alongside another suspect who was not in court. In the charge sheet, Mwangi is accused of hiding 16 rolls of bhang in his trouser and he was arrested by the officers from Kabete police station who were on normal operations. The magistrate directed the case to proceed on October 28.
