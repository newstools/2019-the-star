President Uhuru Kenyatta will tomorrow October 16, preside over the official launch of Phase 2A of the Standard Gauge Railway, Commission the Construction of the JKIA to Westlands Expressway and preside over the groundbreaking ceremony of the Naivasha Inland Container Depot. Phase 2A to Naivasha passes through the five counties of Nairobi, Kajiado, Kiambu, Nakuru and Narok. He will make stopovers to commission and address wananchi at SGR Stations along the new railway line in Ongata Rongai, Ngong, Kimuka (Commission Kimuka Water Project), Mai Mahiu and Suswa. The main function will be at the Mai Mahiu SGR Station. The completion date of the Nairobi-Naivasha section of the Standard Gauge Railway had previously been rescheduled. The contractor had ruled out meeting the June deadline for the multi-billion shilling second phase of the rail network and instead given a new August date. Chinese Communications Construction Company (CCCC) blamed the delay on the compensation row in the Ngong area. "The problem is not ours, it is a government issue because the responsibility on land compensation and relocation should be the employerâ€™s, "Liu said on the phone. On June 23, last year, President Uhuru Kenyatta urged the contractor to stick to the June 2019 completion timeline. Kenyatta said he would like to use the SGR line on his way to Kajiado for Madaraka Day celebrations. Liu said if compensation is not hastened, they will not be able to fulfil the anticipated completion schedule. He said all the stations have been done and what remains is decorations and coordination between stations.
