With his side boasting of one of the two remaining unbeaten records in the Kenyan Premier League,  Mathare United coach Salim Ali has expressed his satisfaction at how the season has panned out so far. In their five matches, Mathare have won once (against Ulinzi Stars) and drawn four (Bandari, Tusker and Kariobangi Sharks) with the latest stalemate being the 2-2 draw against Wazito on Saturday. “When the fixture list was announced, we knew we had to be at our best from day one because all of the five teams we have faced so far are potential title challengers,” said Salim on the clubs official portal. "I believe we have had the most gruelling of starts and to remain unbeaten in this period is an achievement in itself. There have been plenty of positives so we have to keep this up as well as iron out the mistakes that have denied us wins." On Saturday, Mathare took the lead twice and each time they were pegged back by Fred Ambani's charges. Salim feels they should have done better to secure their second win of the season. “I am disappointed, of course, and frustrated that we played well, took the lead twice but could not quite see out the win. I see it as a setback even though we did not lose and we have to work even harder to make sure that when we are in a position to win a match, we make sure that we do just that,” offered Salim. With seven points from five matches, Mathare are currently ranked 10th on the log, five points adrift of league leaders Gor Mahia, the only other unbeaten team in the top-flight division. The Slum Boys have an opportunity to take a breather for the next two weeks to pave way for the international break before returning to take on struggling Kisumu AllStars on October 19.
