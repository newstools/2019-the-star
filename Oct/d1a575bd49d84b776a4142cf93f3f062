Imenti North MP Rahim Dawood has said the Building Bridges Initiative should not be opposed without first looking at its report. He said the 40 MPs from Central Kenya who have given ultimatums for supporting the BBI are misguided and jumping the gun. The MP spoke in Kithoka on Saturday where he held a public participation forum about expansion of a road network by Kenya National Highway Authority  from Meru to Isiolo that will cost of about Sh5 billion. On Thursday, legislators who addressed a press conference at Parliament buildings said they would reject a proposal to either elect a Prime Minister or President. They said that inclusivity in the government would play a big role but it should be address leadership, representation, resource allocation and the structure of the government. The BBI has allegedly proposed introduction of a parliamentary system of government with a powerful Prime Minister and two deputies, radically overhauling the current system of governance. Dawood said politicians should not hold positions as it is too early. “It like getting married and dictating the colour of your kids even before your wife conceives," he said. “Nobody knows yet what the BBI is proposing. There is a lot that can be looked at and be debated,”Dawood said. He said he agrees with Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi that a plebiscite should increase funds to counties. On Mashujaa Day Kiraitu said Meru MCAs did great deal in rejecting Punguza Mizigo initiative because it was not well thought and could have brought more problems than it was trying to solve. The county boss said he would keenly read BBI report. Dawood said counties ought to be given 40 per cent of public revenue. “A lot of functions are performed by county governments ,” he said. He said despite the recent political divisions between Kieleweke and Tanga Tanga about 90 percent will support President Uhuru Kenyatta on building bridges initiatives.
