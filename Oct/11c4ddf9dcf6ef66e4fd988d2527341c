By BENSON NYAGESIBA @nyagesiba Most defilement cases reported in Kisii county are perpetrated by relatives, an officer has said. Ruth Mogaka, the officer in charge of gender mainstreaming and mental health, yesterday said most of the 309 cases recorded at the Sexual Gender-Based Violence clinic at the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital were committed by relatives. She said the victims reported that they were either defiled by a family member or a relative. "It is scaring that a number of defilement cases received at the SGBV clinic were perpetrated by either a family member or a relative,” Mogaka said in her office. Mogaka also said that since the inception of the clinic about two years ago, 137 rape cases and another 16 of sodomy have been recorded. Some 200 cases of GBV, including domestic violence and child abuse, have also been recorded. Mogaka said transgender and intersex are other emerging issues in the region brought about by unresolved sexual conflicts. She said the clinic is discharging its advocacy mandate to reduce SGBV cases in society. The Health Services department receives victims, examines and treats them so they are protected from sexually transmitted diseases. Mogaka said this is meant to enhance access to justice. "After we receive and treat the affected clients, we carry out psychosocial counselling and refer them for legal advice." She expressed concern that some parents settle defilement cases at home in exchange for money at the expense of the future their girls. She warned that culprits will be arrested and prosecuted. "I'm urging parents to stop the habit of settling defilement matters at home and instead take the affected girls to the nearest subcounty hospital for examination and tests within 72 hours after the incident," the officer said She said that they are working closely with the Judiciary so the affected girls get justice.
