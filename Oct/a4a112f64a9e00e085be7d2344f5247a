The heavens opened non-stop two days ago and Mombasa residents are now marooned. Most of the coasterians woke up to flooded houses and roads. Business premises were no-go zones after the heavy rains. The rains have wreaked havoc, rendering roads impassable. Schoolgoing children are at homes. Only a few workers managed to get to their job stations. And the weatherman has warned of heavy rains at the Coast of more than 40mm  from Thursday to Sunday. The Met department advised residents to be on the lookout for flash floods even in areas that are rarely affected. Heavy vehicles plying the Likoni-Lunga Lunga road were redirected to Lunga Lunga-Kwale-Kombani road after a culvert at Muhoho was damaged. The Kenya National Highways Authority told motorists to be cautious. "The heavy rains have cost me a lot. I don’t have a good structure where I can get shelter as I go about my (spares) business," businessman Geoffrey Kamau told the Star. "I stay in Likoni and the floods have really affected us. We have to take off our shoes and wade through the floodwater when boarding the ferry because most of us work in Mombasa," Amina Ahmed said. Those crossing the ferry fear for their security after the recent tragedy that claimed the lives of a woman and her daughter two weeks ago. "I am actually very scared of boarding the ferry because the ramps are slippery and the ferries which have been condemned as dangerous are still working,"  Alfred Nyongesa, a motorist who regularly uses the Likoni channel, said. "We ask the county government to fix drainages or join the pipes which will direct the water to the ocean without us being affected," Nyongesa said. The Met said the most affected coastal regions are Mombasa, Kwale, Tana River and Lamu. The county administration said they are unblocking the drainages. Communications director Richard Chacha said, "The county is in the process of unblocking the drainages in the affected areas." Edited by R.Wamochie
