A man has challenged the withdrawal of High Court judges' diplomatic passports in court. Jonathan Munene has sued Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and Director of Immigration. He has also listed Kenya Judge’s Welfare Association as an interested party. Munene says judges used to enjoy benefits like accessing VIP lounges when they had diplomatic passports. The passports were withdrawn following a legal notice of 2012. The notice excluded High Court judges – without any explanation – from the list of government officials to get diplomatic passports, Munene says. He wants the state compelled to return the judge in the list of those who get the special travelling documents. Those entitled to the documents include the President, Deputy President, Cabinet Secretaries, Chief Justice, Deputy Chief Justice, Supreme Court and Court of Appeal judges. Their spouses are also entitled to get them. The government officials are expected to hand over the diplomatic passports when they leave the office. Munene says the decision poses serious threats to the independence of the Judiciary and ought to be reversed. He accuses the judges' association of being mute as the state threatens the very foundation and fabric of judicial independence. To buttress his case, he quotes the article of the Constitution that says that remuneration and benefits given to a judge should not be varied to the disadvantage of the officer. Further, Munene notes that the Constitution does not discriminate against High Court judges and questions the wisdom behind the government's decision. “There is no rationale as to why the regulations differentiate and discriminate against the judges and those of courts of equal status. The distinction between the various cadres of judges of the superior courts amounts to a substantial difference in treatment in complete violation of the Constitution,” he said. Edited by R.Wamochie
