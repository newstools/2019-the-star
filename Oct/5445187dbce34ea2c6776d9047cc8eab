The firm that was awarded a Sh1 billion contract to maintain the Thika Superhighway on Tuesday said it will scale up operations to ease traffic flow. Debroso Construction Company told The Star it had embarked on 24-hour surveillance. Patrols and communications director Richard Adeka said they plan to recarpet the entire 40km highway by December. So far, it has completed the service lane of the Ruiru-Roysambu stretch. The firm is charged with repairing potholes, unclogging drainage, repairing guard rails and streetlights, responding to accident emergencies and clearing accident scenes. The contract covers two years. Adeka said the company has invested massively in the latest technology to fix drainage problems along the road in the wake of heavy rains that have been pounding the city and environs. The company’s immediate focus is to address flooding to ease the flow of traffic and avert accidents. Its mandate extends to feeder roads. “We are cognisant of the fact that this is a rainy season. Our focus is to ensure a seamless flow of traffic on the superhighway in an efficient and friendly manner,” Adeka said. In a bid to address periodic flooding, the company divided the road into sections and deployed personnel and equipment, where necessary, to tackle the aftermaths of downpours. “We will be on the road round the clock. Our personnel is well equipped to respond to drainage emergencies,” Adeka said. on Tuesday morning, the company opened up a major river clog near Kahawa Garrison that allowed surface runoffs to pass under the bridge between Githurai and the garrison. In the past, several lives have been lost in Kimbo, Githurai and Ojijo around the highway, but Debraso has now deployed teams to work on the three hotspots. (Edited by F'Orieny)
