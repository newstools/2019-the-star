A group of Kalenjin elders in Uasin Gishu have banned a planned circumcision ceremony that was to take place on a disputed land near Moiben area. The over 300 elders said the land had been cursed because of a prolonged dispute over its ownership. It cannot, therefore, be used to host the circumcision ceremony for more than 2,000 youth. The elders have warned parents not to allow their children to take part in the rite of passage. The 570 acre land is part of the expansive Sirgoit Farm whose ownership has been disputed for about 15 years since it was bought by members of the EMO Investments Limited. Two rival factions of the EMO group are now quarreling over the decision to host the circumcision ceremony on the disputed land. “Circumcision is highly significant cultural practice and the initiates are innocent. They cannot go through such a cultural activity on cursed land. It will cause the community problems” Elder Julius Murei said. Murei was accompanied by elders Luca Cherop, Ambrose Arap Rono and Thomas Kemboi. The elders said that they are shareholders of the EMO group and raised more than Sh300 million to buy the land in 2006 but a section of officials had been misusing it for personal gain. They accuse the officials of leasing out the land without informing them. The elders said they have been complaining about the mismanagement of shareholders' funds for 15 years. They wondered why leaders from the community had failed to intervene in the dispute. Murei and his colleagues claimed that since the directors of Emo investment Limited began leasing the land they have pocketed over Sh50 million. “Some of our elders have died because of frustrations over this land. They raised all the money they had to buy the land only for a few people to take it over. We have cursed the land.” Rono said. The elders have appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Lands CS Farida Karoney to intervene in the dispute.
