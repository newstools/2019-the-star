Deputy President William Ruto on Sunday unleashed an array of goodies to Kibra residents as he embarked on a vote hunting mission in the slum Constituency. Ruto on Sunday arrived in Lindi grounds, Kibra to drum up support for Jubilee candidate McDonald Mariga. On a day of heightened campaigns ahead of November 7 by-election, the DP  told residents that a number of projects are on the way if they cast their vote for the Jubilee candidate in the November mini-polls. Top on Ruto’s bag of goodies is the promise of better housing to the residents. He said the Jubilee administration will work on a way of ensuring tenants pay reasonable rent on government houses and later own them after some years. The housing project he noted will be realized through President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four Agenda. “If you are paying for instance Sh.4,000 or Sh.5,000 after 15 years the house becomes yours,” Ruto said. The DP said Mariga is more qualified and appealed to all residents to vote for him as the next MP. He promised to visit Kibra a day after the by-election(November 8) for the groundbreaking for a technical training college in the constituency. The visit he said will be fulfilled if Mariga floors all the 23 other candidates in Kibra race. The DP promised to engage local youths in the numerous projects that will be initiated in Kibra. Ruto was speaking hours after ODM team led by Raila Odinga combed the area addressing well attended rallies in both Bukhungu and Laini Saba grounds.
