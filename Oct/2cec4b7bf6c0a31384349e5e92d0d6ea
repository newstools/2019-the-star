Tanzania, Burundi and South Sudan have been invited for this year's East African Local Authorities Sports and Cultural Associations (EALASCA) games to be held in Kampala, Uganda from December 1 to 8. EALASCA secretary-general Mwangi Kabiri yesterday said already, Kenya, hosts Uganda and Rwanda have confirmed participation in the annual showpiece. The games were last held in Kisumu in 2016 with Kenya emerging overall winners. However, the games failed to take off in 2017 and 2018 due to what the organisers termed as unavoidable circumstances. “Uganda State Minister in charge of Kampala Benna Namugwanya was in Eldoret during CASA games where he officially invited Kenya for EALASCA. Uganda is ready to host the games,” added Kabiri. He said they have included tug of war, chess, scrabble and draughts in this year's extravaganza. Other disciplines include football, volleyball, athletics, darts, pool and netball. The event brings together workers of local authorities and county governments. Kenya will hold trials to select a team for the event from October 28 to 31 at Kapsabet in Nandi County. Players drawn from Kenya Inter-County Sports and Cultural Association (KICOSCA) and County Assembly Sports Associations (CASA) will be invited to battle it out for places in Team Kenya for the games. “We want to select the best so that we retain the title which we last won in Kisumu,” noted Kabiri who is also the secretary-general of Kicosca.
