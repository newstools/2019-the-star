Deputy President William Ruto is a man under siege. What has unfolded in the last two years tells you of a sustained and calculated campaign to provoke his anger so as to abandon the Jubilee ship and swim away. What changed from the flamboyant display of togetherness and unity by President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy? At one point, they looked like identical twins in public functions in matching white shirts and red ties. Previous TV footages capture them frequently consulting while on the VIP dais and laughing loudly in unison. Political pundits and Kenyans at large have been left to wonder whether the Jubilee powerhouse will stand the test of time in the remaining three years to elections. The Kieleweke and Tangatanga factions within Jubilee have made it worse with constant wrangling, chest-thumping and ridiculing each other. Recently, JP Secretary General Raphael Tuju went on record to state that the DP is not the automatic flag bearer of Jubilee come 2022. The DP should sit back and reflect why his Jubilee partners are throwing flak at him with relentless zeal. He should lay very low like an envelope and act aloof until 2021. His enemies will have no vitriol to spew at him then. He will also earn the trust, confidence and ‘anointing’ from his boss who apparently seems unhappy with him for not supporting his Big Four agenda more aggressively. Politics is the only game played without a referee and that’s why it is very dirty. Promises are barely honoured and jilted players are not supposed to have hard feelings. There are also no permanent friends and enemies, its only interests that matter. One requires to have the ability to mutate depending on situations to survive the murky waters of Kenyan politics.
