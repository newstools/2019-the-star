More than 500,000 private security guards have backed new regulations to improve their welfare. Their union, the Kenya National Private Security Workers Union has now started to sensitise members on the new regulations. The regulations will be rolled out from January 1, 2020. The sector is governed by the Private Security Regulatory Authority. Union secretary general Isaac Andabwa said they have said they were working closely with PSRA Director General Fazul Mohammed to ensure the sector is streamlined through the new regulations. The new regulations will guide, among other things, the proposed issuance of guns to security guards, communication gadgets, screening machines and bulletproof vests. “We are fully behind Fazul and the authority which gazetted the new regulations on July 5th,” Andabwa said. Andabwa said all employers will have to comply with the new regulations starting January next year. “The regulations are beneficial to all of us in this sector, and we are saying the expected reforms are long overdue,” Andabwa said. He said some employers, who have been defying the minimum wage requirement set by the government, now fear the new regulations. Andabwa said the country has more than 2,000 security companies, but only about 10 have been complying with government requirements. “Some of them have been defying all labour regulations, and they should stop making unnecessary noise about the new regulations. We want employers to either comply with the new rules or ship out," the unionist said.
