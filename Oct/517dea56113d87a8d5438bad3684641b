World marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge has touched down in Vienna. Kipchoge will be attempting to run under two hours in a 42 kilometres in the race dubbed Ineos 1:59 challenge. Kipchoge who is the Olympic marathon champion landed in the morning aboard a private jet. He left for Vienna aboard Sir Jimâ€™s Gulfstream G280, which was flown by two pilots from his British base to fly Kipchoge to the Austrian capital. Weather conditions could play a part in the historical event. The event has been narrowed to 12th-14th October with a target date of the 12th. The event date will be confirmed three days out and start time the day before the INEOS 1:59 Challenge. One of the reasons Vienna was picked for the venue of the INEOS 1:59 Challenge was its favourable weather conditions in October. The conditions are, for now, looking to be within an acceptable range for the first weekend of the window.
