Some school managements stuff their pupils and students into one vehicle such that one would wonder if the vehicle is an abyss holding the whole school. How can 25 pupils come out of a van meant to carry 14 passengers? This means two pupils share one seat. That sounds like a very uncomfortable journey to school, yet the same pupil is expected to perform their best in exams. The most pathetic thing is that these children are hounded together regardless of gender depending on who got to the seat first. Therefore, girls sit on boysâ€“at probably the most curious age group. Parents should take an interest in the means of transport their children use to school. Traffic police officers should check vehicles to ensure there is not an extra passenger aboard.  Nairobi
