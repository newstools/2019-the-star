From TV to prison to being a brand, Jacque Maribe is a true definition of no situation is permanent. Following her release from custody over links to Monica Kimani's murder, the mother of one has been rekindling her life on social media. She has now updated her profile to strictly business, and one can only contact her through the email account on her bio. Maribe has changed her Instagram bio to: "Love, live, laugh." Before this, she had changed to: "Award-winning journalist, top brand influencer, your favourite event host." Maribe quit Citizen TV in July after being a political affairs reporter at the station for close to eight years. The former TV girl is currently in Maasai Mara for holiday with her baby daddy Eric Omondi and son.
