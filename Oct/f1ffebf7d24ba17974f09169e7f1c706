Kenya Premier League newcomers Kisumu All Stars coach Henry Omino is confident that he will turn around the struggling team's fortunes. Speaking after taking a light morning training at Moi Stadium in Kisumu on Thursday, Omino said: “We have been struggling to get our footing in the league but I'm upbeat that we shall bounce back. I strongly believe that I have a very good team. A lot of things are being said out there but we shall overcome.” The veteran coach attributed his team's poor performance in the league to lack of experience and lack of motivation. He did not elaborate on motivation but added that the club's management is handling it. “Motivation will make a big difference ahead of our next match against Mathare United. I'm appealing to our sponsors and fans not to lose hope in us and also have patience. The league has just started. It is a marathon, not a sprint,” added Omino. A source at the club revealed to the Star that the county is yet to settle the players' salary and allowance arrears. However, the source added that the players would be paid by today. Omino, however, declined to comment on the delay in paying the players and referred the Star to the management of the team. Omino said the international break will give him ample time to rectify mistakes he has identified in the last five matches. “Our stats are very bad from defence to striking. However, I have more than one week to work on the mistakes,” he noted. Omino has welcomed the return of junior internationals Steve Otieno and Alvin Ochieng, who were in Kenya's team that reached the Cecafa under 20 final. The team lost 1-0 to neighbours Tanzania. The club is 17th on the log with just one point out of five matches played. On Monday, the club succumbed to a 3-0 loss against Posta Rangers.
