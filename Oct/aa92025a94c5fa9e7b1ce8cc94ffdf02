Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o has nominated 14 county chief officers and forwarded the list of nominees to the county assembly for vetting and approval. The nominees include Paul Omanga (Agriculture), Haggai Kadiri (Social Services), Rosemary Raluoch (Livestock), Zacheus Oketch (Water), Agwa Yanza  (Environment), Penina Onyango (Education) and Joseph Omulo (Business cooperative). Others are Daniel Okia (Energy), George Arwa (Lands), Geoffrey Ochieng' (Housing), Daniel Ochieng (Finance), Imelda Aoko (Economic), Joseph Okweso  (Health) and Alphonse Ouya ( Planning Strategy Policy). In a press statement on Tuesday, he said the remaining positions shall be re-advertised by County Public Service Board. Nyong'o did not nominate Public Works chief officer. Okoth will replace Orangi Angwenyi as the chief finance officer if approved by the assembly. Alphonse is the brother of former Kisumu chief of staff Patrick Ouya who was sacked by Nyong'o last year. Ouya and Senator Fred Outa played a crucial role in the election of Nyong'o. The two have, however, parted ways as Outa eyes to unseat Nyong'o.
