US Ambassador Kyle McCarter has faulted blogger Robert Alai over an explicit tweet he made to President Donald Trump. "Foul language and disrespect," McCarter wrote on Tuesday in response to Alai's tweet to Trump. Trump tweeted that he was going to destroy and obliterate Turkey's economy if they did anything he considered off limits. This was  after his decision to withdraw US troops from Syria’s border with Turkey on Monday that led to a dangerous resurgence of the Islamic State. "As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I’ve done before!). They must, with Europe and others, watch over," Trump tweeted. The US leader's post did not auger well with Alai, who hurled insults at Trump, adding that he  lacked skills, strategy and power to destroy Turkey. Alai copied McCarter, asking to tame his boss. The blogger in June was  arrested by DCI officers, a day after he posted gory pictures of the officers killed by an IED planted by suspected Al Shabaab militia. Police condemned Alai's post, terming it as a way of glorifying the terrorists. The police also said it was not the right way to convey the message to the families of the fallen police officers. The act was also condemned by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission. NCIC further ordered him to pull down shared photos. Alai did not adhere to the directives and instead, he went on saying that he will continue fighting for police officers. "I will continue to speak out for the poor police officers who are neglected and their allowances taken by 'wakubwa',"  he posted. He was detained for 14 days and released In July on Sh300,000 bail.
