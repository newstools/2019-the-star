Spedag hope to win both their weekend matches as they battle relegation in the Women's Premier League. The team, which sits second from bottom in the league table, is at risk of being relegated if they do not put up a good fight. Camp Toyoyo grounds will be the battlefield when Spedag face Kayole Starlets today and Wadadia tomorrow. Coach Sarah Ogonyo is expecting tough matches but believes her team will give their best to get positive results. “Winning both games will definitely see us move up the league table. That is why my team will need to have a fighting spirit like never before. I am expecting tight matches,” Ogonyo said. “We have had a good run in this second leg and managed to maintain close margins. In our last five matches, we lost one game, won two and drew the other two. We have the potential and with a little push, we will be able to flee the relegation zone,” added Ogonyo. After the weekend, Spedag will remain with three matches to determine their fate having competed in a total of 25 games in the season. In another match today, sixth-placed Kibera Girls' Soccer Academy will clash with Wadadia at the Camp Toyoyo grounds.
