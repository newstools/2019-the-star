Succession battles in Kenya have left many families in anguish years after their parents died. But for Maina Kageni, things were different. Speaking during the morning show on Classic 105, Maina said what saved his family from the succession battles was his father's will. "My dad died when I was two years old. Luckily for him, he left behind a will and after his death, it was entrusted to trustees," he said. "Immediately I turned 21, the properties were transferred to me." Maina Kageni was, however, quick to point out that his dad should have left his properties to his mother rather than to trustees. "My dad was guilty. Why did he not leave everything to my mother?" he asked. His co-host Mwalimu King'ang'i pointed out that unlike Maina Kageni, the only inheritance he received from his father was his mother. "The only thing my dad left me was my mum. You finish school and you realise that responsibilities are waiting for you. The minute you lower your loved one's body into his/her grave, you immediately start thinking of all the debts one has to pay," he said. Mwalimu Kingangi said succession battles among the rich in Kenya is a sad tale that should be handled carefully. "Look at the Michukis, (JM) Kariukis and (Njenga) Karumes and see how they keep fighting in court," he said. "It hurts me so bad because I know that these men worked hard for their money. "Look at the case of John Michuki. He only has six kids yet he had properties worth billions. Why can't they just agree among themselves on how to share the property?"
