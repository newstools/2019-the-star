Leaders in Naivasha want areas near the recently launched Dry Port planned to avoid the mushrooming of slums and informal structures. Led by former Naivasha MP John Mututho, the leaders yesterday said the fortunes of the town are set to change for the better, adding that the area set aside for industries should have a clear plan. Mututho said tens of investors have shown willingness to invest in the town owing to the favourable environment of doing business. “We are learning from countries like Singapore who have made it through the setting up of industries in special zones and this is no different,” he said yesterday. Addressing the press in Naivasha, Mututho told off those opposed to the project, saying they do not represent the interests of Kenyans and residents. Utheri Wa Lari Farm chairman Stephen Muiru said the area has fo long lagged behind in development. He said despite the protracted land dispute between them and pastoralists, they have welcomed the Dry Port and the SGR. “We shall be providing 35 acres for the container depot, and we expect our youths to benefit from this capital project even as we seek encroachers to respect private land,” he said. Last week, the President commissioned the construction of the Inland Container Depot. The work is expected to end by mid next year. DEFENDS APPOINTMENT Mututho further defended the appointment of former Othaya MP Mary Wambui to chair the National Employment Authority board, saying it was in the best interests of Kenyans. The former Nacada chairman said Wambui has the experience needed to guide the new agency to the next level. He urged Kenyans to support her to deliver. “We should stop this public bashing of people appointed by the President. We know Wambui deserves to lead the new institution,” he said. “Wambui leads in the pack of individuals who have helped Kenyans get jobs all over the world and comes second after what former Cabinet minister Njenga Karume did while in power.”
