Members of the Kenya Union of Clinical Officers have threatened to go on strike on November 1 if their demands are met by their employer. Addressing the media on Thursday, the union through chairperson Peterson Wachira expressed its discontent. Wachira said the  union will be forced to take industrial action as efforts for conciliation have failed. The union wrote to Labour CS Peter Tum  on  May 6 after the second failed negotiation and are yet to receive any response. "We wish to inform our members and the public that our right to fair labour practices, right to fair remuneration, reasonable working conditions and collective bargain under Article 41 of the Constitution continue to be contravened with impunity by the employers," Wachira wrote. The union is saddened that despite extra budgetary allocations to the Ministry of Health, all other interns in the ministry  are paid except the diploma clinical officers. "Its inhumane for any young Kenyan to be subjected to unpaid internship for one year without considering how they cater for their basic needs," the union said The union wants all pending promotions and redesignations effected. Some clinical officers have stagnated in one job for more than 10 years despite professional and academic advancement, the union said.
