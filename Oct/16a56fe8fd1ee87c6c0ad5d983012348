The German immigration was under fire after spending Sh15.6 million to deport two Kenyans using a charted jet. A feature on ARD’s magazine Report München revealed that €137,000 was spent to charter a private jet to deport the two men. On September 5, a Bavarian police car drove into the Berlin airport carrying a 48-year-old Kenyan man for deportation. According to a blog dubbed 'Mkenya ujerumani', on board of the chartered private jet, was another Kenyan man also being deported by the state of Baden-Wurttemberg. This was after his asylum application was rejected with no possibility of appealing the decision. The officials claimed the two had been labelled dangerous delinquents. However, no evidence was put forward to support the claim in regards to the man from Baden-Württemberg. The quoted expenditure did not include that of the 14-person team which escorted the two men. But Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria, the states that chartered the private jet have brought forward several excuses to explain the extravagance, reports the blog. It claims that the two had been issued with emergency travel documents by the Kenyan government that were only valid for three days. The unnamed man who has been living in Germany for the past 20 years and has had several encounters with the police in Bavaria. After his last encounter, the Bavarian State Office for Asylum and Repatriation ordered for immediate deportation after serving his sentence. The uneventful exercise took less than 36 hours to deliver the two men in Nairobi and have the team return to Berlin.
