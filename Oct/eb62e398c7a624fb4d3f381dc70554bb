The government will facilitate 100 per cent access to the local market by pharmaceutical companies which currently have 50 per cent access, Trade CS Peter Munya has said. Munya said Kenya is the right destination for foreign direct investments "since it has been consistently leading in promoting investment since 2013". The CS spoke on Tuesday when launching German investment B-Braun Pharmaceutical Industry in Export Processing Zones in Athi River. Â He said the state will support the industry. Munya said the government is ready for investment and that it has created a good workforce and an enabling environment for local investment. The government will implement policy to support local pharmaceutical industries by buying their products instead of importing, he said, disclosing that the government has endeavoured a new power tariff that will reduce the cost of power by 30 per cent for all manufacturing industries. "If there are no tariffs on imported medicine, then why must we force those who have invested in Kenya to sell their products outside before selling in Kenya? It doesn't make sense since it looks like discriminating those who have invested locally." Previously, Munya said, the country faced a challenge promoting investment due to costly power tariffs. B-Braun will be the first investment in Africa, apart from South Africa, where Kenya has supported investment of more than 50 companies from Germany. EPZA chairman Paul Gicheru guaranteed B-Braun the provision of sufficient water and proper sewerage management. Gicheru's comment comes a few days after the authority, through the help of the national government, won a court case over the management of Mavoko Water and Sewerage Company sewer lines.
