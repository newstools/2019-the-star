One lucky musical group stands to win Sh10 million at Old Mutual’s Amazing Voices, a pan-African singing competition. The competition will have contestants from Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe squaring off against each other for the grand prize. The historic talent search reality show will run for 13 weeks until April 5, with auditions in Mombasa and Nairobi taking place this week. The show will seek to unearth unsigned talent with amazing voices across three genres: gospel, pop and rhythm and blues (R&B). Musician Sanaipei Tande and one of Kenya’s leading jazz vocalists Kavutha Mwanzia-Asiyo have been named the Kenyan selectors during the auditions. “We are excited to be the title sponsor for a show we believe will bring Africa together in a unique and uplifting way,” UAP Old Mutual group head of marketing Carol Kipsanai said.
