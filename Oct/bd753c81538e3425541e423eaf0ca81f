The court has allowed the DCI to investigate suspected tender fraud worth Sh840 million at the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority. Judge Mwita Chacha of the Constitutional and Human Rights Division ruled that Harry & Stan company that tried to stop the probe did not provide sufficient reasons. “I am not persuaded that the petitioner has discharged the constitutional burden required of it by principles in constitutional litigation to warrant grant of the reliefs sought in the petition,” the judge ruled. Harry & Stan had filed the petition against Inspector General of Police, Director of Criminal Investigations and Sai Cargo Motors Limited claiming violation of its constitutional rights and fundamental freedoms. Kemsa was enjoined as an interested party in support of the Harry & Stan application to stop the investigation, saying the tenders were awarded according to procurement law. According to the DCI, they unearthed possible fraud and collusion. The multi-million shilling transport tenders were initiated in 2016 and finalised in 2017. The bidders were required to provide at least three customer referrals within three years where they had made Sh20 million annual revenue or carried out a project of similar value. The tenders were awarded to BM Logistics at a cost of Sh39.8 million while Harry & Stan won another at Sh17.8 million. BM Logistics won the tender to supply Eastern at Sh12.5 million. They cost Sh70.2 million quarterly and ran for three years at Sh842 million. Harry & Stan argued the Public Procurement Administration Review Board okayed the tenders, saying they were properly awarded. Judge Chacha ruled that there was no doubt the DCI has a mandate to conduct investigations with a view to detecting and preventing crime once reported.
