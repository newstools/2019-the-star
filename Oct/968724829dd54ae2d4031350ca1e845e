The Nairobi County Assembly will now have to wait for a gazette notice to announce a return of the plenary session. This comes after embattled County Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi suspended next week’s sessions following Wednesday's chaos that marked her return. The adjournment which is legally known as sine die means an adjournment without any return date or fixing a date for the next session. The County Assembly Standing Orders No 29 (3) states that on a day when the County Assembly is scheduled to adjourn to a day other than the next normal sitting day in accordance with the County Assembly Calendar, the leader of the majority party or the leader of the minority party or another member of the County Assembly Business Committee shall move a motion of adjournment which shall be debated for not more than three hours after which the County Assembly shall adjourn without question put. Elachi told the Star on Thursday the adjournment was in order to allow for calmness before the house resumes its sittings. “The legislators will be told the date of return but for now let members use this time to sort out any indifference and find a noble solution forward,” she said. “The temperatures need to cool down. We shall gazette the return of the plenary.” The assembly on Wednesday turned into a battlefield with chaos, tear gas dominating City Hall for three hours after Elachi made her way back into the assembly. The property was damaged, phone accessories were stolen as rival 'goons' made their way into the assembly and clashed over Elachi's return. The MCAs were also divided with those on Elachi’s side and others against her return which was led by Majority leader Abdi Hassan Guyo and Acting Speaker Chege Mwaura.
