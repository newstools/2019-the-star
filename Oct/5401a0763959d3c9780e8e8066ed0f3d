Homeboyz coach Jason Hector  is keen to reach the playoffs of the Kenya Cup set to start later this month. The former Sharks Academy coach, who was appointed in June on a two-year contract, said he has the depth in the squad to make the cut at the end of the season. "Our target for the season will be to make it to the playoffs then from there, we will take it one game at a time and who knows how things will go,” he said. The Deejays had a disappointing season last year, finishing ninth and bowing out of the Enterprise Cup to Quins in the quarter-finals. Hector said the current squad is a blend of youth and experience and the Deejays will want to prove a point in the upcoming season. “Our leadership group is good. Charles Odhiambo and Jeff Oluoch have really helped  and with the young players in the squad, they will help them settle for the upcoming season." The Deejays have lost Patrick Ouko to KCB with Israel Soi and Steve Otieno joining Impala. Hector expects a competitive season with the likes of Quins, Impala Kabras and KCB all strengthening their squads. “ It will be a tough season. When you look at the other clubs, they have made additions to their team and they will be very strong,” added Hector.  The South African tactician had a nasty neck injury at the age of 18, which kept him out of competitive rugby. Since then, he has been involved in coaching at Sharks Academy, Western Province Currie Cup Under-21, Stellenbosch University Academy and Newcastle Falcons in the United Kingdom. Homeboyz  beat Nondies 23-14 in the Impala Floodlits tournament and will face champions KCB on Saturday in the semifinals. The winner of the tie will face off with Quins or Menengai Oilers in the final on October 12. Homeboyz will open their campaign against Quins and will follow up with fixtures against Nakuru and Menengai Oilers.
