Two men cheated their way into a mortuary in Bungoma after showing fake identification documents and stole the deceased's fingerprint. The men identified themselves to the morgue attendants as detectives from Luanda police station and needed the dead man's fingerprints to conduct investigations. The fake cops took off immediately family member Geoffrey Oyaro arrived at the mortuary to check on the body of his father Wilfred Awinja. “Immediately I arrived there, they took off on seeing me. The morgue attendant showed me a piece of paper that they were shown purportedly indicating them as DCI officers from Luanda police station,” Oyaro told the Star. The matter has been reported to Bungoma police station under the OB number 53/02/2019. The incident happened days after the family of Conjesta Nakhumicha, one of the deceased man's wives, won a case at the Bungoma law courts allowing her to bury her husband. The court had given orders that the body should not be tempered with until the case was determined. Awinja had two families, one in Bungoma and another in Luanda. They are embroiled in a court battle over his estate. The court ruled that the will written by Awinja was genuine. But the family of one of his wives appealed the ruling and the matter is yet to be determined. Confirming the incident, Bungoma head of criminal investigations Daniel Mulei  said he never got any information from Luanda police station regarding any investigations they were conducting. “I am not aware of such investigations. Those people claiming to be officers never consulted our branch on the same," Mulei said. Family spokesman Ben Wechuli asked the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to probe the incident. “This matter is in court and there is no court order allowing the Luanda family or anybody else to take the fingerprint or temper with the body of the deceased in anyway. We need action,” he said.
