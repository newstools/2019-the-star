DPP Noordin Haji and DCI George Kinoti have commended the Catholic church for its stance on donations from politicians. In a joint statement on Tuesday night, the two applauded the Kenya Catholic Conference of Bishops for taking a "resolute stand and offering much needed spiritual and moral leadership in the country's fight against corruption". "The stand by the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops has provided clear directions through which faithfuls can back their faith claims with corresponding praxis of morality and accountability," the statement read. Bishops resolved to put strict rules to govern donations to churches during a National Prayer Day held last Saturday at the Subukia Shrine in the Diocese of Nakuru. In a communique titled, 'Promoting the justice of God: A campaign against corruption', the bishops highlighted the steps the church was taking to fight corruption. However, Deputy President opposed the bid to regulate church donations, saying it is more blessed to give than receive. He said politicians are faithfuls first, before they are leaders. The Deputy President is a generous giver of donations during fundraisers and other church events. Haji and Kinoti said corruption has robbed the country of potential. Haji and Kinoti pointed to a meeting they had with religious leaders, in which they urged the clerics to join them in the war on graft, adding that they were glad their call was responded to. "Religion as the backbone of every community is a key determinant of social morality and societal values," they said. The two called for other groups to emulate the conference of bishops.
