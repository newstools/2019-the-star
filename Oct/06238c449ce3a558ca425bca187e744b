Former US President Barrack Obama has lauded Kenyan athletes for their epic performance depicted over the weekend. In a tweet on Monday, Obama said both Eliud Kipchoge and Brigid Kosgei are remarkable examples of humanity ability to endure and keep raising the bar. Eliud Kipchoge became the first human to finish a 42km marathon in under two hours. Eliud finished the Ineos marathon on Saturday by clocking the line at 1:59:40:02. Sunday was yet another victorious day for Kenyans as Brigid Kosgei finished the Chicago women's Marathon at 2:14:04. Brigid broke a world record that had stood for 16 years, held by British athlete Paula Radcliffe. Radcliffe had clocked of 2:15:25 at the London Marathon in 2003, becoming the longest-standing marathon world record. Radcliffe was at the finish line of the Chicago Marathon, where she witnessed her 16-year world record being smashed by a 25-year old Kenyan marathoner. Radcliffe congratulated Brigid for her remarkable performance. "When I saw how fast Brigid was running in the first half, I knew it was going to be broken," Kenyan, Lawrence Cherono, won the men's race at 2:05:45. Eliud received congratulatory messages across the world. President Uhuru Kenyatta also joined millions of other supporters in congratulating him. The President in his message said the win will inspire future generations to 'dream big and aspire for greatness'. “You've done it; you've made history and made Kenya proud while at it. We celebrate you and wish you God's blessings,” the President said.
