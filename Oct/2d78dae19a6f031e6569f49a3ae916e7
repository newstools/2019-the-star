The Kenya Revenue Authority has deployed 12 staff to handle customs clearance operations at the Lapsset corridor ahead of the port's commissioning on November 8. On Monday, KRA board chairperson Francis Muthaura and other officials toured the Sh2.5 trillion Lapsset project to assess the level of preparedness for the commencement of operations. President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to commission the first berth at the port in a colourful event during which the first-ever cargo ship is expected to dock. Muthaura said all the personnel dispatched are well trained and have vast experience in handling customs clearance operations. The official met Kenya Ports Authority managing director Daniel Manduku and Lapsset Corridor Development Authority director general Sylvester Kasuku during the tour. “As required under the East African Customs Management Act, the KRA will help with offloading import and export cargo. That means KRA is well prepared to practice its full mandate once the Lamu port begins operations,” Muthaura said. The KRA team also held deliberations with county commissioner Irungu Macharia and Governor Fahim Twaha. During the visit, Muthaura and other top KRA staff also opened a new office block at Lamu Island to coordinate its operations across the county. The construction and rehabilitation of the building commenced early last year and took exactly 12 months to be completed at Sh18 million. The tax board chairman said the offices had come on time as the region continues to open up for more trade, industries and other investment opportunities with the new port in place. He called on KRA staff across the country to practice high-level discipline and integrity in their daily chores, a move he said will help fight corruption in the country. Other KRA board members present were Rose Waruhiu, Susan Mudhune, Leonard Ithau and Paul Icharia. Edited by R.Wamochie
