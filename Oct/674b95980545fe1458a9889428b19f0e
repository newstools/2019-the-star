A Mombasa priest who was found dead in a car in Likoni, was on Tuesday buried at Mbaraki cemetery. Mass was held for Rev Ernest Mutua at the Holy Ghost Cathedral and presided by over by Mombasa diocese archbishop Martin Kivuva. He was eulogised as a dedicated priest with a good sense of humour. Mutua, who was the immediate parish priest of Infant Jesus, Mtwapa, died at the age of 73 years. He was driving along Likoni, Lunga Lunga road, before his body was found in a parked car near Kona Mbaya in Likoni less than two weeks ago. The incident happened on October 16 at 1.30pm. According to earlier police reports, they suspected that the deceased parked his car after feeling unwell. The deceased was alone in the car and is suspected to have died from a heart attack. Kivuva said the church has acquired land at Bububu area in South Coast to build a well equipped hospital which will help residents access health care without crossing the ferry.
