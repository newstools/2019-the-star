Rice farmers and residents of Bunyala area of Budalang'i Constituency are demanding compensation following the commissioning of the Sh5.3 billion Lower Nzoia irrigation project by Deputy president William Ruto in June this year. They warned it was improper for the DP to launch the project at its infancy even before the affected were compensated, threatening to hold a demonstration. Speaking to journalists in Budalang'i on Friday, Nasiongo and Igigo residents said that they are unhappy with the ongoing rehabilitation of the dykes stating that they are sub-standard. "The relevant authorities should follow up for us to find a lasting solution, how can the government initiate a project before compensating those affected, there was a quotation made before this project started, where is the money?" They wondered. The Sh10 billion project, jointly funded by the government and the World Bank, runs 34-kilometres along the Nzoia River in an area once ravaged by incessant floods that displaced residents annually. Ten kilometers out of the 34 kilometers of the dykes are complete since the launch.
