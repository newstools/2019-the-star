 The start of KCPE exam was delayed by almost three hours in parts of West Pokot after heavy rains rendered most roads impassable. West Pokot county commissioner Apollo Okello said 17 schools in North Pokot and another four schools in Pokot South subcounties were affected. In North Pokot, River Kasei burst its banks forcing transporters of exam materials to wait for the waters to subside before crossing. By 10:30 am, four schools had not started the exam, Okello said. “We sent a land cruiser to transport the exam. The school buses that were transporting the exam cannot cross the river,” Okello said. "In the next the 30 minutes, the affected fours schools in North Pokot subcounty will have begun their exam." In Pokot South, the commissioner said transporters were forced to use motorbikes after vehicles got stuck. “Four schools in the region began the exam late but they are going on well now," Okello said. The administrator said they had made arrangements with hospitals to ensure students who give birth during the test continue with the test in the health facilities. “We have made plans concerning pregnant candidates in the county to ensure that they sit for the exam without disruptions,” he said. A total of 14,517 candidates registered for exams in West Pokot county.  edited by peter obuya
