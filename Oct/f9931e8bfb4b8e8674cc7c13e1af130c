An MCA has sued Nairobi County Assembly over her suspension which she says has cost her Sh1.9 million in allowances. Mary Ariviza who was suspended from assembly sittings for 30 sessions over allegations of misconduct and now wants the decision halted. She says that the decision by committee on powers and privilege was reached without affording her opportunity to cross-examine witnesses who testified against her. Ariviza contends that the committee did not bother to give her formal communication in relation to her suspension which she only learnt of when the report was adopted by the assembly on June 13, 2019. She wants the county assembly to be ordered to pay her Sh5 million as damages for psychological trauma. The assembly is yet to file response because it has not been served with suit papers.
