Eldoret Youth will take back their place in the National Super League after the withdrawal of Northern Wanderers with a quarter of the season played. FKF official in charge of leagues and competitions Frank Ogolla confirmed the return of Eldoret. “Northern Wanderers officially threw in the towel citing financial challenges. As per their agreement with Eldoret Youth, the slot reverts back to Eldoret,” Ogolla confirmed yesterday. Earlier, Wanderers CEO Dr Abdinasir Khaalif had written to Football Kenya Federation, requesting for the disbandment of the team. “We kindly request the federation to accept our decision to dissolve Northern Wanderers since our financial situation does not warrant the club to compete.” “In good faith, we would like Eldoret Youth to take up our position with immediate effect and accorded all necessary support to compete and retain the club in the league. We apologise for any inconveniences caused,” read part of Abdinasir's letter to FKF. According to Eldoret Youth team manager Anderson Sango, they started training last week after receiving news that Wanderers has been disbanded. “We are hoping to get good results from Sunday and the subsequent nine matches left in the first round. We want to get out of the relegation zone. Come second round, we will sign new players to boost the team because our target was and has always been to play at Kenya Premier League,” said Sango Wanderers still without a point failed to win any match in ten matches played, conceded 35 goals while scoring eight times. Eldoret's first match on their return will be a home game against Shabana
