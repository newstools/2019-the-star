Deputy President William Ruto paid tribute to his staff member Anthony Kariuki, describing him as sharp, dependable, industrious, committed and creative. Kariuki died on Friday last week in an accident on Outering Road. Until his demise, he was the Deputy Director of Communications at the Office of the Deputy President. Ruto said Kariuki was a man with tremendous sense of placid disposition, intellect and full of positive attitude. “In any assignment he was involved, you knew it would turn out to be better. He made priceless contributions to my Office,” Ruto said. He spoke on Friday during the funeral service of Kariuki at PCEA, Ngundu Church in Kamulu, Machakos County. Ruto was accompanied by Meru Senator Mithika Linturi, Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua, and his Buuri counterpart Mugambi Rindikiri. While pledging to support the family, Ruto regretted that he had lost a valued and professional worker. Previously, Kariuki worked at the Nation Media Group as the Digital Editor and Plan International East and Southern Africa as the Social and Web Editor. The Office of the Deputy President’s Communication Secretary David Mugonyi eulogised Kariuki as focussed, popular and a highly engaging peer. “He was ever fit to provide counsel and perspective on media and communication issues. Anthony changed the dynamic wherever he was,” said Mr Mugonyi. Nation Media Group’s Parliamentary Editor Lucas Barasa said Anthony was a great man, “who challenged our approach to issues”.“ Kariuki, 40, was married to Christine Wakio. They were blessed with two children, Darren Macharia and Deina Nyambura.
