Rabai OCS Henry Marube died on Saturday night in a road accident in Makobeni on the Kaloleni-Mazeras highway. Marube succumbed to injuries at the Mariakani Subcounty Hospital. Rabai subcounty police commander David Maina said the accident occurred at around 11pm on Saturday. Barely two weeks ago, eight people perished at the same spot in an accident involving six vehicles. Maina said the OCS was heading to work in his personal car. “He was heading towards Bondora when his car veered right, hitting a big stone. We cannot establish whether there is anything that distracted him because he was alone in the car,” Maina said. The police boss said the officer was found by boda boda operators who took him to a hospital in Bondora. He was then referred to Mariakani in critical condition. “They didn’t know he was the OCS, and they took him to hospital and later went and reported to the police station,” he said. Before he became the OCS, he served as the Rabai police headquarters staffing officer. His body is at Jocham Hospital mortuary. Edited by R.Wamochie
