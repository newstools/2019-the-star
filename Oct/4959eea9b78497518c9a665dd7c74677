Kenya’s batting crumbled as they were bowled out for 94 to lose to Namibia by 87 runs in their ICC Twenty20 World Cup Qualifier tie in UAE yesterday. Chasing 181 for 5 after some poor bowling show at the end of the first innings, Kenya were in the dark for the entire second innings and failed to give the Namibians any challenge. With the loss, Kenya dropped two places to sixth and are faced with a must-win situation against leaders PNG tomorrow. Bernard Scholtz was Kenyans’ main tormentor with 4 wickets, reducing them to six wickets for 53 in 12 overs. It took Rakep Patel’s 30 for Kenya to avoid a 100 plus runs loss. The decision to stick with the same opening pair of Irfan Karim and Aman Gandhi didn’t work out as poor communication between the stand ended with a run-out. The two had provided a century run stand in their last match against Singapore. With the board at seven after 12 balls, Karim tried to sneak a run that was not on to mid-wicket and by the time Gandhi tried to send him back, he had no chance of making it back in time. Dhiren Gondaria and Gandhi added on 21 before Gondaria got a top-edge when trying to swipe across the line. From 28 for 1 after five overs, the board was at 53 for 6 after seven overs later, thanks to Scholtz’s brilliant display. Jasraj Kundi was Scholtz’s first casualty on two off the last ball of the sixth over. He then blew off Gandhi’s hopes of another match-winning show when he beat him with the flight to crash his leg stump on 20 runs. In the 11th over, Collins Obuya followed with skipper Shem Ngoche being trapped lbw. Rakep Patel and Nelson Odhiambo got Kenya to 79 before Odhiambo was caught in the deep. Rakep then hit Jan Frylinck for three consecutive fours before getting done in by a yorker, which rattled his stumps, to fall for 30. JJ Smit summed up Kenya’s fate, dismissing Sachin Bhudia and Elijah Otieno.
