Kabras and Uganda international star Phillip Wokorach has joined French Division three outfit Bourges. Details of his signing remain scanty but Wokorach is expected to join his new employers in November after playing for Uganda in the Safari Sevens and Olympic qualifiers in South Africa. Kabras rugby chairman Phillip Jalango while confirming the move wished the player the very best in his career going forward. “He has been a good servant for the club and we wish him well in his new journey," added Jalango. The tall lanky Ugandan import was the Kenya Cup top scorer last season with 23 tries to his credit. He played a pivotal role as the sugar millers bagged their first-ever Enterprise Cup cup beating Impala 37-7 in the final. He also led the club in qualifying for the Kenya Cup finals for three years in a row and was a menace for opposing defenders with his quick feet and pace as well as ability to kick penalty goals. Jalango was bullish about the side's prospects for the upcoming 2019-220 season without the mercurial fullback. “ This team is not built around one individual. It's a collection of supremely talented players and I am confident we will be competitive come this season,” he added. The Kakamega-based side signed Fijian Timoci Sinaite and utility back South African Ntabeni Dukisa from EP Kings in South Africa. Kabras forwards George Nyambua, Joseph Odero, Ephraim Oduor and Brian Tonya had a two-month stint in South Africa with Prime Rose RFC as a way of embracing professionalism and improving forward play. The team started an intense one-week training camp in Kakamega over the weekend in preparation for the start of the league at the end of the month. Kabras will play two build up matches against Homeboyz and Oilers this month before the league starts.
