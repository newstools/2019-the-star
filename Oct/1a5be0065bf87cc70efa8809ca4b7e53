Last season’s triumphant Champions League campaign has given Liverpool the confidence and belief they can win the Premier League this season, midfielder James Milner has said. Liverpool beat Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League final in June to win their first trophy under manager Jurgen Klopp and finished second in the Premier League, a point behind Manchester City. Klopp’s team lead the league by six points this season after a strong start and Milner hopes the experience of winning Europe’s elite club competition will help in their pursuit of a first league title in 30 years. “This season we have a team that can do it,” Milner told the Guardian newspaper. “I think there’s a calm around the club, both inside and outside, and people are confident we can get it done. “Hopefully winning that first trophy, the European Cup, as a squad will give us the experience to win the league.” Liverpool won the last of their 18 top-flight league titles in 1990 and Milner said the team were expecting another tight title race in which defending champions City push them every step of the way. “City are so good they’re capable of winning every game,” the 33-year-old added. “The gap is not that big so we have to just keep pushing and not worry too much about the title. A couple of bad games can happen and with the amount of games we’re playing there might be a couple of injuries. It could be a couple of poor performances and the lead’s gone. That’s why it’s so special to win the league.” Liverpool host Arsenal in a fourth-round League Cup encounter tonight before resuming their Premier League campaign at promoted Aston Villa on Saturday.
