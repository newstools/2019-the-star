  "I have forgiven you" is all a Kibera magistrate needed to hear from a complainant before freeing Jane Muchee, accused of stealing from an American soldier. Muchee walked to freedom on Friday after Willy Martin withdrew the case, saying he had forgiven the street beggar who had drugged him and stolen his mobile phones and laptops all valued at Sh175,000. Kibera senior resident magistrate Barbara Ojoo was told that Martin had left a  Nairobi hotel on September 20, and was approached by two women begging money. “One of the ladies was in tears. She seemed desperate and in dire need of help,” the soldier reported to the police. “The woman said that she needed fare to her home as she had not made any cash that day­­­­­," the soldier's report said. Martin gave her Sh500 and she left but Muchee remained and after she heard him tell his two friends they should get some food, she too said she was hungry. “She heard me telling my friends that we go and look for some food and she asked to join us and I accepted,” the American's report to the police said. They all entered into a vehicle and drove to a fast-food restaurant where they bought packed food and went directly to the home of Martin’s cousin Paul Ondari in Westlands. “When we arrived home, Paul went to sleep as I remained with the lady in the living room where we talked and watched movies." Martin suspects Muchee drugged him as he fell deeply asleep only to wake up to find his valuables and the accused missing. “I only realised that I had been robbed when my cousin woke me up at around noon. The lady was missing too,” he told the police. Muchee was arrested in Ruiru town by the public after she was identified by one of the complainant’s friends. The friend had identified her from CCTV footage. Martin opted to withdraw the case and informed state counsel Nancy Kerubo that he had forgiven the accused. Ojoo subsequently acquitted Muchee.
