Police have arrested a woman after the decomposing body of her 13-year-old son was found wrapped in a blanket in South B estate. Nairobi police boss Philip Ndolo said officers found the body in the living room at around 6 pm on Wednesday. "We acted after neighbours raised an alarm that there was a foul smell emanating from the house," Ndolo told the Star on phone. Ndolo said the suspect was in the house at the time adding that they are investigating the incident. This comes after a few weeks after a woman and her daughter were murdered occurred in South B's Golden Gate estate. A senior police officer told The Star that preliminary investigations indicate that 47-year-old Catherine Nyaguthii might have killed her ageing mother Judith Mwai, 74, before ending her own life. He added, however, that toxicology was important for confirmation.
