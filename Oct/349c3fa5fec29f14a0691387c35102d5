Wajir East MP Rashid Kassim punched me twice leading to a cut on my left side of the tongue, Fatuma Gedi has said. Gedi who is the Wajir woman representative recounted the happenings of June 13, 2019, to a Milimani Law Court on Tuesday. In her testimony, Gedi revealed that indeed, Kassim demanded to know she, as a member of the Budget and Appropriations committee, failed to allocate money to his constituency during a visit by the budget team. Gedi further confirmed that following the budget allocation discussion, Kassim punched her twice leading to the cut. In June, Kassim was charged with assaulting Gedi at Parliament Buildings, Nairobi. The court heard that on June 13 at around mid-morning at Parliament parking lot, the legislator willfully and unlawfully assaulted Gedi and injured her. He denied the charges. His lawyer, Sam Nyaberi, asked that he be released on free bond, arguing that the accused presented himself to the police at Parliament. Kassim denied the charges and chief magistrate Francis Andayi released him on a Sh50,000 cash bail.
