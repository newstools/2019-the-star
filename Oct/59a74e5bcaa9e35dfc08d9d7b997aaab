The tribulations facing Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu continue to compound by the day. Some residents have now demanded a by-election to elect a new county chief. This comes after a group began collecting signatures from voters to have Waititu leave the office. The political landscape is slowly changing to Waititu's disadvantage. The county boss was barred from accessing office after he was charged with graft. Residents, led by Mbugua Turi, on Wednesday said Deputy Governor James Nyoro, who is currently acting as governor, should not be sworn in as a governor if the Okoa Kiambu petition succeeds. He said Nyoro might not meet the needs of residents because he will be overwhelmed bu the idea of having trounced his boss. "I feel like Nyoro should not be sworn in if the petition sails through. So many people will feel as if Nyoro engineered the whole thing and he pushed his boss until he lost, yet he was no involved," Turi said. Okoa Kiambu official Wanja Wagichungumwa said the Constitution says a governor can be impeached by a petition that is supported by a quarter of the votes he won with. In this case, they require only 200,000 signatures. Since Wednesday last week when they launched the exercise, they have collected more than 100,000 signatures. "We've not had any problem. People are volunteering to give out their signatures. No one is being forced. It's voluntary" she said. Meanwhile, MCAs have denied being a party to the petition. They say they will wait for the petition and the signatures to be tabled in the assembly. Majority leader Gideon Gachara (Ndeiya) said they will go through the petition and ensure the signatures are scrutinised before being tabled for discussion. "We are not involved at all in the collection. MCAs will come in when the whole thing will be tabled in the assembly. That is when our role will come in," he said.
