The cancer scourge will continue to devastate Kenyans if the government will not scale up sensitisation programmes, Kilifi South MP Ken Chonga has said. He slammed the government for doing little to enlighten the public on the scourge. Speaking on Sunday when he opened a medical camp for cancer screening and family planning, organised by the Ken Chonga Foundation and other partners, Chonga said the belief in witchcraft has led to many cancer patients fail to visit hospitals early. The legislator explained how his grandparents died of the scourge and how desperate patients are milked their money by witch doctors. “Cancer presents itself in many forms and because not so many health facilities can easily diagnose cancer, most people believe they have been bewitched hence they seek the services of witch doctors. They visit health facilities rather late. If the government can create more awareness on cancer then probably people would go for early screening,” said Chonga Chonga wants the scourge declared a national disaster. “Cancer is killing more people than HIV/Aids. The government needs to declare this a national disaster so that more effort can be put to increase awareness. Many poor people are dying and the government is mum. It’s only the other day when prominent people died when the government realised the matter is serious,” said Chonga Chonga said cancer medication is expensive and when the disease is declared a national disaster, medication costs will go down. Mulika Saratani Patron Florence Kitsao said most parents get the wrong diagnosis until the problem advances.
