Nairobi County Government intends to convert the Dandora dumpsite into a recreational park after it is decommissioned. This is one of the highlights of the County Annual Development Plan 2020-2021. Previously the authorities intended to relocate the dumpsite. CADP says methane will be generated from the residual waste at the dumpsite for power generation. In July last year, Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko said an energy recycling plant will cost the county Sh28 billion. Sonko had at the time said the county was in the final stages of awarding a contract for the construction of the plant. There is no contract one and a quarter years later. There will be no need to relocate the dumpsite since the recycling plant will convert the waste into 160MW clean and renewable energy per day. However, in August this year, there were reports that the waste-to-energy recycling plant could take longer to be set up. The county government was said to be scouting for technology specifically designed for the circular model of waste management proposed by authorities. Yesterday, County Executive for Environment Vesca Kangogo said, “The Dandora dumpsite will still be operational but the dumpsite will be eventually decommissioned in an environmentally sound manner and eventually turned into a park.” The county plans to have two landfills at Kamukunji and Lang'ata fore waste that cannot be recycled after the phase-out of the Dandora dumpsite. Before then, a feasibility study will be done to come up with recommendations for a Resettlement Action Plan for households likely to be affected since the sites will be near human settlements, Kangogo said. Kangogo told the Star that consultations were ongoing with the national government and the Public-Private Partnership Unit on the best way to get an investor to do the project. Dandora dumpsite holds over 1.8 million tons of solid waste against 500,000 tons capacity. More than 2,500 tonnes of waste is deposited at the site daily.
