THUNDER coach Collins Gaya hopes danger man Kevin Chogo recovers fully before their Premier League match against Ulinzi Warriors on Friday night. Chogo limped off injured in an 82-68 thrashing of Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) last Sunday. He tallied 18 points in this top clash. “We have not trained since the weekend and I don’t know how he is.  But I hope the injury will not keep him outside this game,” he noted. He had over a week of engagement during the Inter-banks competition and I believe he overstretched himself. This is what brought him down.” Gaya also revealed that Shem Otieno who showed courage in that win despite not being fully fit will be on the roster. “Despite playing with a long nagging injury,  Otieno showed unbelievable courage in that game. He will be available,” he said. Gaya revealed he will go full throttle against the soldiers in the match which will determine who tops the table ahead of the play-offs. “If we rebound well and give them one shot per attempt, chances are high we will do to them what we did to KPA,” said Gaya one of the nation’s most exciting coaches. He said they hope to close tabs on Ulinzi’s danger man Victor Bosire, Eric Mutoro and James Mwangi. The trio provides the bulk of the team’s points. Veteran Annette Wafula, who switch camp this year from Ulinzi, will also be available this time. He missed the KPA show due to personal commitments. “I missed two key players in that match including Pascal Nabwana because we had requested for a postponement that never came to pass.” Ulinzi, who are six-time national champions, have lost only one match.
