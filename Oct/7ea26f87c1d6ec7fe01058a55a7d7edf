South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma will file an appeal in his corruption trial after a court ruled last week against his application for the case be dropped. The corruption allegations, which Zuma denies, date back to the country's largest arms contract in the 1990s. Attempts to bring him to court stretch back 15 years. This comes as the US Treasury last week imposed sanctions against the Gupta family and an associate over alleged corruption in South Africa. The sanctions were targeted at brothers Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta, and South African businessman Salim Essa. They are accused of using their friendship with Zuma to profit financially and influence ministerial appointments. The accused have denied any wrongdoing. Zuma, who was forced to resign as president in February 2018, has faced allegations he oversaw a web of corruption while in office. He was replaced by his then-deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa, who promised to tackle corruption in South Africa.
