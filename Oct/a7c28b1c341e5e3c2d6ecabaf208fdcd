Police in Wajir are pursuing suspected al Shabaab militants who escaped after being overpowered by the police in Dadajabula. They were trying to rescue their two colleagues who had been arrested. County commissioner Loyford Kibaara said a security officer stationed at Dadajabula police post killed two suspects in the ensuing shootout during the 8pm incident on Tuesday. Two police officers also sustained gunshot wounds on their hips, and a woman was injured by a stray bullet in her leg. The three are receiving treatment and are in stable condition. “The militants were trying to rescue their two colleagues who had earlier been intercepted by police at Dadajibula roadblock. It is during the shootout that two of them were gunned down," Kibaara said. "Another group, whose number we have not yet established, run towards the Kenya-Somalia border, which is 13km away,” he said. Kibaara, who spoke to reporters in his office on Wednesday, termed as ‘untrue’ reports that some officers were missing and that the militants made away with firearms. “All our officers have been accounted for. Other than two who are injured, the rest are okay. I want to appeal to the residents of Wajir to remain calm as the situation is under control. They should also stop spreading rumours,” he said. A police officer stationed in the camp who anonymously spoke to the Star said the militants ambushed them and started shouting in the Somali language as they shot indiscriminately, prompting them to respond. The incident delayed the start of KCPE exams at Dadajibula Primary School, as the  Kiswahili, Science and Insha papers were delivered hours later. Kibaara told journalists examinations officials had to wait  for the military to clear the road between Beyamadow, where the exams container is, and Dadajibula Primary School a distance of 50 kilometers.
