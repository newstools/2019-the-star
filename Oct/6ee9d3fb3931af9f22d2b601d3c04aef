After setting a new course record at Frankfurt Marathon last weekend, Valary Aiyabei Jemeli is now eyeing a new world record over the distance in one of the World Marathon Majors next season. The Iten-based athlete ran the fifth-fastest women’s marathon time in Frankfurt after recording 2:19.10 to break the previous course record of 2:20.36 set by Ethiopia’s Meskerem Assefa in 2018. The 2019 Eldoret City Marathon champion jetted back in the country on Tuesday afternoon accompanied by her husband Kenneth Kiplagat and their daughter Michelle Jebet. Aiyabei said it is possible to bring down the women’s marathon record after Brigid Kosgei ran a new mark of 2:14:01 to break the 16-year-old mark of 2:15:25 set by Paula Radcliffe in Chicago on October 13. “My plan is to break the record  in one of the World Marathon Majors. I will plan with my coaches to see which race is convenient for me and my mission,” added Aiyabei. The reigning 2018 Beijing Marathon champion said she wants to run in one of the big marathons including New York, Berlin, Tokyo, Chicago, Boston and London in a bid to realise her dream. “It is possible to break the world record. It all depends on one’s mental strength, psyche and how you train. I have a dream to lower Kosgei’s record and I believe with God’s blessings, It will come to pass,” added Aiyabei. The former Kass Marathon champion said she is especially motivated to take another step in her running career after Kosgei Shattered the women’s record in Chicago. “For me, Kosgei’s feat was very inspiring and I have decided to emulate her and make another step in my career,” she said. Her husband Kiplagat said they are going to get some time off for recovery as they wait for the next season and he hopes they will get an opportunity to compete in a major marathon. “We are going to rest and recover while doing some light training as we wait for the management’s direction on the next step,” he added.
