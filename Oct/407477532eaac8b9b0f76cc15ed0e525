Kiss 100 radio presenter Kamene Goro has dug into her dark past as she remembers how her mother-in-law frustrated her. Kamene, who was dating a Tanzanian man, said this on "The Morning Kiss". “I was living in my house under constant pressure. Am I making him happy? And even worse, was I making him happy by her standards?” she said. "She used to hate me. So she would send in food to the house because she did not want him to eat my ‘bad’ food. I confronted her to stop it and then it became a war. She later moved to calling my house girls and commanding them on how to make food for my husband." The radio presenter went on to talk about charm. "I was a young frustrated bride. She even went to the extent of calling the watchman and requested him to be told when I leave the house so she can send a house girl to put charm under the bed so that my husband hates me and we do not get children. It was bad." This year, Kamene would have been celebrating her third wedding anniversary. "I was to get married on this day three years ago but I dodged the bullet. I would have been miserable today," she said. "I would have been in Tanzania right now with a lot of money even if I was not working, but miserable and not able to live my dream."
