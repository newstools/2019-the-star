The violence meted on Kibra by-election candidates Eliud Owalo (ANC) and McDonald Mariga (Jubilee) is being condoned, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has claimed. Murokomen in a Twitter post on Monday claimed that the violence was being sanitised. "The violence was perpetrated by the politically correct 'father of democracy and good governance'," he said. "No wonder Junet and Mbadi havenâ€™t recorded any statement even after outright acts of incitement to violence ostensibly to protect the handshake." ANC Party leader Musalia Mudavadi's rally on Sunday was disrupted by rowdy youth who threw stones at his brigade. He was addressing his supporters when a group of youths emerged from behind and started hurling stones and bottles at his vehicle. With him was Owalo, Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi and other party officials. On October 13, Mariga was forced to flee a group of irate youth who pelted his convoy with stones. The youths attempted to deflate the tyres of his vehicle after a campaign rally turned ugly.
