The 47-minute video clip recorded by police informer Peter Ngugi showing him confess to the murder of lawyer Willie Kimani will not be played in court as expected. This is after Justice Jessie Lessit allowed his application opposing playing of the video in court. In the video, Ngugi took police to all the places he and his accomplices went and what they did on the day Kimani,  his client and a taxi driver were killed. Lessit ruled that the police officer who took the video did not follow the rules on confession when he took the evidence. "In conclusion, I uphold that the evidence of the crime scene construction recorded will not be admitted." The court also faulted the investigating officer for being present when the confession video was being recorded. Forensic officer Joseph Muindi had last Tuesday told the court he recorded the video. Lawyer Kevin Michuki for Ngugi opposed playing of the video, saying the prosecution had not complied with the confession rules. He asked the court not to allow the playing of the video because it would prejudice his client. He argued the prosecution had not indicated any attempts to comply with out-of-court confession rules other than the witness submissions that they cautioned the accused. Michuki said the purported interviewer was the investigating officer, which was a grievous infringement of the rights of his client as set out in the Constitution.
