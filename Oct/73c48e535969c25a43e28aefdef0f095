KENYA Ports Authority (KPA) have shifted focus to the Premier League play-offs after failing to recapture the FIBA Africa Zone 5 women’s club crown in Dar-es-salaam yesterday. A confident ports women were stunned 63-58 by Ugandan side JKL Dolphins in a tough final match at the National Stadium. Coach Mike Opel said the team will now shift their attention to the post-season games as well as fine-tune for next month’s Africa Women Club Championships in Madagascar. “Our defence wasn’t good at all. We had too many fouls and missed baskets under the rim,” said Opel adding, “Though we fell short of our target, I’m happy with the performance and will work on our weaknesses on both offence and defence,” he noted. Despite the loss, KPA, who were zonal champions in 2016 and 2017 bagged the other ticket to next month’s continental showpiece. The Kenyan girls were 33-28 up at half-time. Equity Bank who relinquished their crown in the semis after losing 62-53 to JKL were placed fourth after a 68-54 loss to Rwandese side APR. The bankers' stand-in coach Carey “T9” Oketch blamed the defeat on an injury suffered by the team’s star player Betty Kananu. ‘When we lost Kananu, nobody stepped up. It affected team morale in a big way. Injuries to our players also played a big role in our performance,” he said. In the semis,  KPA easily dismissed Rwanda Patriotic Army  62-46 while JKL Dolphins dethroned Equity Bank 62-53 in the other semis.
