Kitui residents who cannot afford the high cost of cancer screening will on Friday next  week  get  the  service  free of charge courtesy of a church. Kitui Trinity Chapel in collaboration with 40 doctors from Bangladesh and the Nairobi Hospital will conduct a three-day medical camp on cancer screening. The exercise will take place between October 18 and 20 at Neema Hospital. The free medical camp will also cover dental care, gynecological care, optical services, minor surgeries  and nutritional education. “We have been touched by the plight of our people who have been suffering and living with cancer because up to 90 per cent of the population cannot afford the high cost of screening,” pastor Dennis Makau said. Addressing the press in Kitui, Makau  said  the  church  had  mobilised  up to Sh2 million for the medical camp.  "We expect about 3,000 residents to attend the camp,”  the clergyman said. “When Jesus Christ was around on Earth he performed healing of the sick. Likewise we are following in his footsteps.” He said although the county government had made efforts to make health care affordable, it had not managed to ease the burden on people with complex ailments like cancers. “Many people are suffering amidst the efforts of our Governor Charity Ngilu and her leadership offering free treatment in our hospitals. Our church has decided to chip in and support her vision of universal healthcare,” Makau said.
