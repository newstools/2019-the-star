  The free cervical cancer vaccination campaign targeting 10-year-old girls will go a long way in protecting them against the killer disease, Bungoma First Lady Caroline Wangamati said on Tuesday. Wangamati appealed to parents to present their girls for screening and vaccination. She spoke during the launch of the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine programme at Bungoma County Referral Hospital. “Let young girls be vaccinated against the cancer monster,” she said, adding that the exercise will be successful with the cooperation of teachers. Some 36,000 girls are targeted for vaccination. Bungoma Woman Representative Catherine Wambilianga, who spoke at the same function, called on residents to get tested for cancer. “The government should sustain cancer vaccination so that it does not fail like the sanitary pads programme,” Wambilianga said. She called for severe penalties for those who engaged in sex with underage girls. “A tough decision should be made against the molesters of the girl child. Teenage girls are not items to satisfy some men sexually. The culprits should be severely punished,” the Woman Rep said. She at the same time called for an end to disco matangas as they exposed the girl child to sex perverts who molest and impregnate them. Bungoma Health director John Akatu stressed the need to protect children against cancer. “Prevention is better than cure. Let them be immunised at an early age to stop cancer. The vaccine is safe; parents should not worry,” the medic said. Akatu said the programme focused on schools because that is where most of the targeted girls can be easily accessed. He said cervix and breast cancers are the most serious and widespread among women.
