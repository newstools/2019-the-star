Government Spokesperson Cyrus Oguna has explained the delay in retrieving the bodies of Likoni Ferry victims. The vehicle carrying a mother and daughter who drowned in the Indian Ocean was traced on Wednesday afternoon. Divers sighted the car-like object sitting 58 metres deep at the sea bed of the Likoni crossing channel at 2pm. The retrieval which was to begin on October 10, at 9am did not begin as intended. Speaking to journalists at the Coast, Oguna said they had to wait for human traffic across the channel to reduce. Many people cross the channel to the mainland. "We are waiting for the people crossing the Likoni ferry area to reduce in number before we can start the process because we do not want any interference," he said. Oguna further added that strong currents were being experienced in the area and it would not be safe to send divers down to pull out the car. The government spokesman also noted that they were waiting for two ships to cross for the retrieval to go ahead without interference. "The car will be pulled out by close of business on Thursday(today)," he told journalists. Oguna added that counselling sessions, which have been going on, will not stop until the families of the victims are stable. On Wednesday, Oguna said he cannot confirm yet, whether the bodies are in the vehicle. “What is remaining is about 10 per cent. We need to confirm the number plate of that vehicle to ascertain if indeed it is the one that sunk into the channel on September 29,” he said. Family spokesperson Luka Mbati said they will not comment until they see the bodies.
