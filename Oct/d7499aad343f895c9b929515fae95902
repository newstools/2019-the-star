Strathmore handball team coach, Peter Mwathi has attributed their unbeaten run in the 2019/2020 league to the watertight defence his charges have exhibited in  recent matches. Strathmore are placed second in the 23-team log after crushing Technical University of Kenya (TUK) 37-08 over the weekend at the Kaloleni grounds. Mwathi, who is also the national men's team tactician at the institution, said he has built an all-round squad and each player is defence-minded.  This, he said he is a strong pillar against their opponents. "We have been working on our defensive play and it has panned out well. It has helped us to avoid conceding many goals as reflected in our weekend match where they restricted TUK to a paltry eight goals. If we keep up the pace, our goal area will be a no-go-zone for even the top teams," Mwathi said. The tutor added that having all-rounded charges is an added advantage to his side, saying it throws the opponents off balance in terms of marking. Mwathi alluded that despite key players missing from his squad, their replacements have taken up the task quite well. "I am very confident with my team. The boys continue to show great performance. The void left by those who graduated has been filled with greater potential,"  the tactician noted. Handball Kenya Federation league coordinator, George Asimeto confirmed that Kenyatta University (men and women's) teams will not be available for their matches due to their ongoing strike.
