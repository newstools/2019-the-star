The Futures tournament in Mozambique next month will offer Ismael Changawa a chance to 'spy' against Indonesia, whom they are set to face at the Euro/Africa Group II playoffs in March 2020. The top-seed player is in the Kenyan Davis Cup team which will face Indonesia as per the draw conducted yesterday at the International Tennis Federation (ITF) offices in London. Changawa said he is yet to face an Indonesian and therefore feels meeting one at the Futures in November will help him determine what strategy to apply come next year. “I do not know what to expect since it is a little early. I have never played against an Indonesian before and my hope is to meet them at the Futures. In case I do, I will derive an idea on what to train for,” said Changawa. “If this doesn't happen, I will rely on the good training we have had so far." The playoffs will be held on March 6-7 in Indonesia and the winning team will proceed to play in the luxurious Group II. 12 nations which advanced from the 2019 regional Group III will play against 12 losing teams from the 2019 Group II. Head coach Rosemary Owino is confident in the preparations the team has been putting towards the playoffs. The soft-spoken tactician has promised to do whatever it takes to see the team progress to the next round. “We are going to take a step at a time as we prepare extensively for the playoffs. Currently, the boys are heading for their individual Futures tournaments and we have been training well. Indonesia is quite a good team but we have set up shop and are determined to bag that win," said Owino. Kenya's win in the playoffs will see them play Group II ties in September 2020 together with losing nations from the world Group I playoffs.
