Ambitious African 3,000m Steeplechase champion Benjamin Kigen is plotting to upset the form book and clinch gold at the World Athletics Championships final at the Khalifa International Stadium, Doha Qatar today. Kigen made a massive statement in the semi-finals where he led the defending champion Conseslus Kipruto home but was out-sprinted few metres to the line. Kenya, who have four representatives in the finals will be seeking their 13th win in 17 championships. Save from the duo of Kipruto and Kigen, Kenya will also look up to Commonwealth silver medallist Abraham Kibiwott and World U-20 silver medallist and debutant Leonard Bett. Kigen said besides teamwork, he will muscle for the gold medal. "We have four Kenyans in the final and teamwork is important. We only have three medals to jostle for and everyone wants the golden one. I will be going for it. During the semis, I did not have time to look back until Kipruto told me to slow down and save energy for the final. We do not fear our opponents as we are prepared to beat them," said Kigen. Meanwhile, Kipruto believes achieving championship record is not a far-fetched dream. The Commonwealth and Olympic champion was a major doubt for the championship due to a hip injury which kept him out for the better part of the season but he revealed that he has since regained his form. Kipruto cautioned his teammates against bolting early. "I began testing myself in the last Diamond League legs and I am fit. From how I performed in the semis attempting championships record is still within reach. As a team, we have to calculate and execute as usual. We cannot afford to be pacemakers," added Kipruto. "Being the defending champion, I am planning to all the tactics. I want to show my class as well as how to become a world champion.’’ Among athletes deemed as a threat are three-time diamond league winner Moroccan Sofiane El Bakkali, Getnet Wale and Lamecha Girma both of Ethiopia and Hillary Bor of United States of America.
