Strathmore University Blades tackle World Hope in a Premier League clash at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium today. The students are eyeing a good finish in the top tier and are confident especially coming off a 65-63 stunner against reigning champions Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) at their own back yard in Mombasa last weekend. National team star Ronny Gundo has brought some sanity and belief into the side, according to coach Tony Ochieng and his exploits will be key in this matchup against the fast-declining opponents. Another team that is eyeing a playoff spot are Kenya College of Accountancy (KCA) University, who beat World Hope 56-48 and are aware a win over Equity Bank who are eyeing a fourth spot finish will do the trick. The bankers won 76-71 in Eldoret and will be a tougher kill. United States International University (USIU) Tigers will be seeking to evade relegation as they face Emyba. Any negative results will obviously not help their cause. They lost 80-55 to KPA in Mombasa despite putting up a fight. In the women’s category, champions Equity Bank play already relegated Western Delight while USIU Flames who were extinguished 103-29 in Mombasa play Strathmore University Swords, a team that was also in the coastal city and were swept away 75-49. KPA women will be at home against Tangit Sparks and will bank on the vision of Natalie Akinyi and national team captain Hilda Indasi. KPA men, on the other hand, welcome home Lakeside who will make a long trip from Kisumu. Tomorrow, USIU Flames entertain Western Delight in a game they are sure of a win while surprise package the University of Nairobi Dynamites hope their Cinderella run will continue as they take on Storms. USIU entertain the visiting Eldonets, who lost 76-71 at home to Equity Bank as the bankers meet battling Emyba in another tough duel. In Mombasa, Africa Nazarene University play KPA in their last fixture.
