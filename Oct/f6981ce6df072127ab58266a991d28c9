Ugandan police have sealed off Bobi Wine's home in the capital, Kampala, hours afterÂ saying he could not go ahead with a concert that was to coincide with the country's independence day celebrations. The musician-turned-politician has tweeted photos showing police vehicles surrounding his home, as well as spiked road barriers erected on a road leading to the house. He claimed police had also sealed off his lakeside property, One Love Beach Busabala, the venue for the concert. Authorities announced on Tuesday that Bobi Wine's concert was cancelled because organisers had failed "to heed minimum security standards".
