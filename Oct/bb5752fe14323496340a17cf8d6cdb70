A newly-elected Tunisian MP has appeared in court on Tuesday over a video allegedly showing him masturbating in front of a school. Zouheir Makhlouf, a member of the Qalb Tounes party whose leader lost the presidential contest on Sunday, represents the coastal town of Nabeul. The MP said he was diabetic and he was urinating into a bottle in the video. The video which was widely shared across social media prompted women to share testimonies of sexual harassment under the hashtag Ena-Zeda, meaning Me Too in the Tunisian dialect.
