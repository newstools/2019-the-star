Elachi was brought back to the assembly by a number of city MCAs from the minority side. "Nobody will impose you on us.. you have been rejected before by Dagoretti north constituents , we rejected you and you are trying to get a back through the backdoor," Majority leader Abdi Guyo was heard shouting. Washing their faces with bottled water, some MCA's asked why Elachi was being forced on them. "How can you impose yourselves on us.. we will not allow that ...," one shouted. In one corner, some women were heard shouting " Achana na mama(leave her alone). According to an MCA who sort anonymity, the ODM MCAs had planned Elachi's return, without involving the House leadership.
