Kisii Governor James Ongwae has urged counties to partner with international organisations, especially in the health sector. He said developed countries have made strides in economic development because they prioritise the health of their people. Ongwae, whoÂ is in the UK for an official visit, told the Star his administration is seeking support from partners to improve health services. The governor made the trip following an invitation by Health Education England in collaboration with Amref-UK/GAFFI and the University of Manchester. During the visit, Ongwae met with Lord Nigel Crisp of the House of Lords, who chairs Global Health. Lord Nigel informed the governor there is a need for Kenya to set up a Kenya-UK Health Alliance to access UK funding and collaboration with UK-based institutions. If Kenya enters into such arrangements, Lord Nigel said, it would be considered for hosting the East Africa-UK Health Summit in 2021.
