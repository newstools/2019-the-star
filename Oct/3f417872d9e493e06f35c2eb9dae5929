The government has said it is ready for national examinations despite heavy rains in Taita Taveta county. County director of education Simon Wanjohi said all plans are set for the 2019 KCPE and KCSE exams. “All materials are ready and everyone is well prepared to administer the examinations,” Wanjohi told the Star on phone. KCPE will start on October 28, while KCSE is set for November 4. Wanjohi said the county had not recorded any case of indiscipline and expressed high hopes for good performance. He said said the government is monitoring areas prone to flooding to ensure the examinations are not interfered with. “This region has been experiencing heavy rains for the past one week. But we are glad that no cases of flooding have been reported. However, we are keen on areas like Taveta, Mata and Kimorigo that have experienced flooding in the past,” he said. A total of 4,994 and 8,236 will sit for KCSE and KCPE exams in Taita Taveta county respectively. Deputy Governor Majala Mlagui urged parents not to exert pressure on their children to attain certain grades. She said unwarranted pressure would result in poor grades. “Let us give our candidates all the support they need and appreciate them. Every candidate will have a chance to proceed to the next level,” Majala said.
