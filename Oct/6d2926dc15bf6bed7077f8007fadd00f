Southampton have improved tactically from last season but the Premier League club are still being let down by a lack of consistency, midfielder Oriol Romeu has said. The Saints narrowly avoided relegation last season and with only two wins from eight games this year they sit 17th in the table, a run of three straight defeats leaving them just above the danger zone. Ralph Hasenhuettl’s side visit Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday and Romeu said there had to be a reaction. “I’m sure that the team is much stronger than it was last season. We control more things and we are stronger tactically, but we need to prove that by getting points,” said Romeu. “The consistency hasn’t been the best in the last two seasons. The sooner we can get a result and the more consistent we can get, the team will be able to play with a different mentality and approach. “We, as a team, want to have a reaction and want to show that the last games weren’t at the level that we want to have.” Southampton are only outside the relegation zone thanks to having scored two more goals than 18th-placed Everton but Romeu said it was too early in the season to panic. “I’d be worried if there was one game left and we were still down there but that’s not the case,” the 28-year-old Spaniard added. “We still have a lot of games and time to finish this season. The only view that me and the lads have is how we can have a better season.”
