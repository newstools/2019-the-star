A ferry stalled midstream with passengers and vehicles on Sunday evening. MV Likoni developed mechanical problems and started drifting under heavy ocean currents at 9pm. MV Jambo was forced to push the stalled ferry to the shore and vehicles were forced to exit in reverse while passengers stampeded out of the ferry. A private guard who was on duty said the ferry stalled for about 10 minutes, but refused to go on record. "It just drifted a small distance away. If nobody was injured then it's not a major issue, just mechanical problems," Likoni subcounty police commander Benjamin Rotich said on Monday. On Saturday night, part of the roof of MV Likoni made of loosely fixed iron sheets was almost blown off by winds which accompanied heavy rains. The incident comes barely two days after a 13-day salvage process comprisingÂ  local and international divers retrieved bodies of Mariam Kighenda and her daughter Amanda Mutheu at the sea. The two died when the vehicle they were in slid off MV Harambee on September 29. MV Harambee is still operating with the ramp still hanging. The Auditor General's report for the year ended 2017 found that MV Likoni and MV Kwale had operated for more than 30,000 hours without mandatory overhaul dry docking. Global safety standard code for ferries and ships, International Safety Management (ISM) recommendations require vessels to dry-dock after 8,500 hours.
