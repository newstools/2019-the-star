Gender-based violence is one of the most persistent violations of human rights across the globe. According to the World Health Organization, about a third of women worldwide have experienced violence though few people report or go public. Gender violence ranges from verbal to emotional, physical and sexual abuse. Impacts of gender violence not only result in divorce and separation but also infection of sexually transmitted infections as in the case of sexual abuse. Children who experience physical fights between parents develop low self-esteem that affects their academic performance. Research also shows that children in families where gender violence is rife develop rebellious characters. Inadequate sensitisation on the dangers of gender violence also contributes the rising cases. Kenya is a signatory to various international protocols that aim to protect women from any form of gender violence. These include the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child as well as the Maputo Protocol. Locally, Kenya also has the Sexual Offences Act. To free all–men and women–from gender and other forms of violence, we must implement these covenants and policies. Awareness of the dangers of harmful cultural practices will reduce gender violence at an early age. Kenya has witnessed increasing cases of gender violence especially in marriage and relationships, most of them resulting in death. Couples are advised to seek professional help when the relationship becomes rocky to avoid such cases. Access to information and services, the involvement of men in the campaign against sexual violence will reduce cases of gender sexual violence.  Naya Kenya, Nairobi
