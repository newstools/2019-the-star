Police in Machakos are investigating a case in which a Form 4 student was found dead at the Export Processing Zones in Athi River, on Wednesday. Ian Ndeto, 18, a student at Athi River Secondary School was reported missing on Sunday after he left home for church but never returned. His parents reported the matter to Athi River Police Station on Tuesday. AN EPZ security guard found the body and notified the police who came to the scene.  The body was taken to the Machakos Level 5 mortuary. Ndeto's parents said they had been looking for him since Sunday and his friends at church said they had left him in Athi River market. It was unclear how his body ended up in EPZ. “It's very sad that he won’t write his KSCE exams because he had come from far to reach here,” his mother said. Athi River subcounty police commander Samwel Mukuusi said the boy’s body was found dumped in a bush 10 kilometres from  EPZ station with his hands tied from the back. "He was reported missing from their residence at Stage 39 area in Canaan sublocation," Mukuusi said. Mukuusi added that it appeared the student had been killed since he was found with several deep cuts on the head and other parts of the body. He urged his parents to remain calm as police investigate the matter with a view to finding his killer.
