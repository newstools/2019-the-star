Residents of Nanyee in Loima, Turkana, will soon be food secure after the intervention of UN agencies Food Agricultural Organisation and World Food Programme. FAO is training farmers on crop production and kitting them with farm equipment funded by the European Union, according to Daniel Irura, officer in-charge of Turkana. WFP has assisted in the construction of a 1.2km canal from Turkwel River and a 4.6km perimeter wall to keep away animals, the organisation's area programme officer Gabriel Ekale said. Each of the 760 farmers in the Turkwel Belt has been allocated 0.5-acre plot on which to grow maize, sorghum, cowpeas and vegetables throughout the year. The project covers 235 acres. Regina Atabo says she has been able to pay school fees for her son in high school from the proceeds of her farm and also feed her family. Moses Emuria, the chairman of Nanyee irrigation scheme, thanked FAO and WFP for the assistance. “WFP has also linked farmers with markets where they can sell their surplus food. They can now plant crops three times a year due to the availability of water,” he said.
