A 10km charity walk held annually by the Mudavadi Memorial Foundation Trust recently took place at Hillcrest International School. It was organised by Nairobi Hospice in support of cancer patients and flagged off by the trust fund managing trustee and founder Tessie Mudavadi. She urged the government to offer more support to palliative care during curative treatment. The walk coincided with the birthday of foundation patron and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi. The school's children surprised him with a birthday cake.
