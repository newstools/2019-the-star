The government has said it will support the family affected by the Likoni tragedy. A vehicle ferrying Mariam Kighenda, 35, and her daughter Amanda Mutheu, 4, veered off the rear ramp aboard the MV Harambee on Monday and sank into the ocean. "We condole with the bereaved family and we wish to state that we have been in contact with the family and will provide any assistance that the family may need," government spokesperson Cyrus Oguna said on Tuesday. Kighenda and her daughter were returning from a farm trip in Kwale, when the tragedy happened. The government has initiated a rescue effort and mobilised a multi-agency team that comprises divers and other experts from the Kenya Navy, Kenya Ferry Services, Kenya Ports Authority, the Kenya Coast Guard Service as well as Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute. Oguna said the efforts to recover the bodies have been affected by poor weather, the nature of the channel, which is the only gateway into Mombasa port, together with the heavy commuter traffic into Mombasa island. "This not withstanding, the government is committed to ensuring that the recovery effort is successfully concluded as soon as possible," he said. Oguna called for patience.
