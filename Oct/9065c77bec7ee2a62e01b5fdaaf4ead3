Shujaa will face Cote' d' Ivoire in their opening match of the Olympics Sevens qualifiers in Johannesburg next month. Africa Sevens champions Zimbabwe will take on Nigeria in the first match while  Uganda have been paired against Mauritius. In other matches of the first round, Madagascar face Botswana, Zambia take on  Ghana, Tunisia confront Namibia and Senegal against Morocco. According to Rugby Africa, a different format will be used in this year’s tournament. Fourteen teams will take part in the tournament and they have been ranked according to their last year's performance. The tournament starts with qualifying matches for the second round as follows: 1 vs 14, 2 vs 13, 3 vs 12, 4 vs 11, 5 vs. 10, 6 vs 9, 7 vs 8.  The winners of each match will qualify for the Championship and they will be joined by one best loser to form a group of eight teams which will be drawn in pools of four teams each, according to round one ranking. Winners of match one, four, five and the best loser will form Pool 'A' of the Championship as winners of Match two, three, six and seven forms Pool 'B'. The other six losers will be drawn in two pools of three teams to battle for the trophy. Shujaa have stepped up preparations for the qualifier by having a four-day intense training camp ahead of the qualifiers following a successful Safari Sevens tournament, where Morans upset South Africa 19-14 a fortnight ago. Head coach cum technical director Paul Feeney has a strong squad to choose from for the final 12 players who will head to the qualifiers and to the World Sevens set for early December in Dubai. Feeney expects competitive Olympic qualifiers but was happy with the progress the team has made since being appointed coach last month. "The boys and rest of the management staff have done well to adjust to new training methods and tactics and we hope it will culminate with us qualifying for us the Olympics."
