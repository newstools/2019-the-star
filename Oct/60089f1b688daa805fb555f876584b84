The Malindi by-election recorded a high turn out of voters despite the heavy rains that hit the area. Hundreds of voters braved the heavy rains and flooded roads to reach polling stations to exercise their democratic right. Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa ended up being arrested on Wednesday following a fracas when she stormed the home of ODM candidate Reuben Katana in a bid to stop campaigns. Katana's uncle was killed in the process. She said the campaign period was over. Jumwa was released on bail on Thursday and declared, "No retreat, no surrender." Meanwhile, 16,632 voters were expected to vote in the 12 polling centres and 30 polling stations. Four candidates - Katana, Abdulrahman Omar - independent, Joseph Kiponda of Jubilee party and Kadu Asili's David Mitsanze are contesting in the race. At Takaye Primary School, which is the tallying centre for the ward, returning officer Juma Musa said  the exercise begun well as all polling stations opened at 6am. "We expect the turn out of voters to remain high and urge residents to come out in large numbers because security is high. We have talked to the OCPD and he assured me that there is enough security,'' he said. KilifI North MP Owen Baya of ODM  who visited the main tallying centre said they were happy that despite the rain, voters turned out in large numbers to vote.
