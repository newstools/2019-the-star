In May, the ministry secured the release of 1,400 Ethiopians imprisoned in the Gulf state following discussions between the two countries, Chinese news agency Xinhua reported. Thousands of Ethiopians migrate to the Gulf and southern Africa is search of economic opportunities, with many of them arrested for illegal entry to their destinations. Ethiopian government has also been struggling with resettling millions of internally-displaced -people following ethnic conflicts. Ethnic conflict in the country, which intensified after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came into office in April 2018, had forced many people out of their homes. Earlier this month, Ethiopian President Sahle-Work Zewde told the annual joint session of the House of People's Representatives and the House of the Federation, that only 100,000 people remained in camps.
