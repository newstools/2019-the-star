Basically, the Building Bridges Initiative is going to face challenges and one of those challenges has been mentioned by MPs from Mt Kenya region. Their main argument is, if we go parliamentary, we are in a sense saying MPs will decide who becomes the CEO of this country, and they have a problem with that. Their problem is the current constituency boundaries do not favour them. So if MPs will decide who the CEO will be and yet they are already disadvantaged, then they are unlikely to support it. And it is not just them. Many people feel there was a lot of dishonesty when constituency boundaries were reviewed. Small constituencies were split into two, other small places were given constituencies. You can cite Vihiga was split into two, Suba, Mvita and many others. People feel the review produced constituency boundaries that do not reflect the truth on the ground. The principle of one man one vote will highly be compromised if we go to a parliamentary system of government before the issue of boundaries is addressed. The Mt Kenya MPs have a point. Now, the Leader of Majority in the National Assembly Aden Duale comes from that part of the country which will be highly disadvantaged if these Central Kenya MPs have their way. So these MPs are saying, how can Ruiru with so many people have one MP and then constituencies where Duale comes from, with even 10,000 people, also have one MP. So if you address the concerns of Central Kenya MPs, you will only do so at the expense of Duale and his people. That is where the problem is and we have to deal with that. It will be very difficult to give parliament the powers to determine who becomes the CEO of the country before addressing the constituency boundaries. I may not support it because what they are talking about is only one way of determining representation. The Constitution gives other parameters, but Mt Kenya politicians want to concentrate on population alone. Herman Manyora, a political analyst, spoke to the Star
