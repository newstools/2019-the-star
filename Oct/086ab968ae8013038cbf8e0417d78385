World marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge began his first day in Vienna by running on the challenge course with several of his pacemakers. Kipchoge who arrived in Vienna on Tuesday was seen beginning his race-week preparations ahead of the #INEOS159 Challenge. "I am very excited to be here in Vienna. I have now seen the course for the first time and it looked great," Kipchoge said. "I can't wait to run on it and hopefully I will see you all there this weekend." The world record holder landed on Tuesday morning aboard a private jet. He left for Vienna aboard Sir Jimâ€™s Gulfstream G280, which was flown by two pilots from his British base to fly Kipchoge to the Austrian capital. The jet, as reported to be valued at Sh2.4 billion was flown into the country by two pilots from Britain. The jet is highly regarded for its two Honeywell HTF7250G engines that make it one of the fastest in the market. According to corporatejetinvestor, the G280 is so fast that it broke 30 city-pair speed records in just its first year of production.
