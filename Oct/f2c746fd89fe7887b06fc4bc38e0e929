The road from Kongowea Market in Mombasa towards Nyali Bridge on your way to Mombasa town is in total darkness, the same as the drive towards Kongowea Market from town. This has become dangerous because a driver can miss the guard rails while driving along the bridge and cause an accident. Also, a driver can fail to see other motorists joining the road from adjacent lanes, resulting in an avoidable accident. Therefore, it is a high time the county government of Mombasa​ and the national government allocated funds the same way Thika​ ​​Superhighway has an allocation to repair the guard rails, road and the bridge. To save on electricity, let the county or national government buy solar lights which will make use of the sun all day and light up the streets in the night.  Mombasa
