President Uhuru Kenyatta has appointed Gershom Otachi as the NLC chairman. In a Gazette notice on Wednesday, Uhuru also appointed eight commissioners for a six-year nonrenewable term. They are: former Nyeri Town MP Esther Murugi, former Egerton University vice chancellor James Tuitoek, former Isiolo Woman MP Tiyah Galgalo, Alister Mutugi, Reginald Okumu and Gertrude Nduku Esther Murugi, James Tuitoek, Getrude Nguku, Reginald Okumu, Kazungu Kambi, Hubbie Hussein Al-Haji, Alister Mutugi and Tiya Galgalo. Former Labour CS Kazungu Kambi narrowly survived a plot to eliminate his name from the nominees for the National Lands Commission on Tuesday. Otachi was among the battery of lawyers who represented Uhuru during his ICC case at The Hague. The approval ends the long wait at NLC which has been without commissioners since the exit of the Swazuri-led team in February. There had been calls for Swazuri to leave over integrity issues. Cotu boss Francis Atwoli said Kazungu has been mentioned in various scandals and thus he cannot be trusted to be in charge of such a sensitive position. Atwoli in a statement said the purported clearance by the Parliamentary Lands committee for his appointment is itself suspect and portrays ineptitude.
