Spectators will savour spectacular action as outgoing Division 1 champion Eric Bengi and his lady navigator Tuta Mionki ruffle feathers on home soil in KCB Meru Rally on November 9. Others include KNRC  Division Two current leaders Issa Amwari and partner Job Njiru and Ken Nteree, who will also enjoy home advantage in the 283.42km event. KCB Bank central regional sales manager Emphantus Mundia and Meru branch manager Patrick Mutuku said the bank has injected over Sh1billion sponsorship in the rally since 2003. Mundia added that the bank is sponsoring this year’s KNRC series to the tune of  Sh20m. This is a huge way of growing the sport. "We are proud to be associated with the Meru Rally as part of our long term motorsport sponsorship since 2003 which has seen KCB Bank inject over Sh1billion towards the development of the sport,” Mundia said. Clerk of the course Hellen Kagendo on her part said this year’s event is running 80 per cent on open roads and encouraged the spectators to catch the action at the designated spectator viewing point. “In line with our main sponsors KCB Bank’s motto of taking the rally-sport closer to the people, we are glad to be back in Meru county and looking forward to a fun-filled race day on November 9. "As organisers of the event, we are overly excited to traverse the picturesque Meru county terrain after a 9 years hiatus. "Meru last hosted a round of the Kenya National rally Championship in 2010 and got overwhelming support from the authorities and locals,” Kagendo said. Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi hailed the organisers of the occasion and asked Meru rally lovers to come out in large numbers to cheer. He said his government is committed to supporting sports and tourism in the county.
