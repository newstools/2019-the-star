Former Kasarani MP Elizabeth Ongoro has linked Nairobi politics to the EACC investigations over Sh48 million NG-CDF cash. The former legislator said on Thursday that she is being targeted by her rivals, adding that she was cleared by all institutions when she was handing over. "This is a political battle and the battle is for me. This is a process of eliminating Elizabeth Ongoro from Nairobi politics," she said. Ongoro did not specify who was allegedly out to tarnish her name. During ODM's nominations for the 2017 Ruaraka ticket, Ongoro lost to TJ Kajwang and there was a bitter battle which ended in her defecting from the party. She was interrogated by EACC officials for more than three hours. She said the money that is in question was diverted to Kariobangi Girls High School. "The funds that were meant for Kasarani Girls were transferred and we built Karaiobangi Girls within the same Constituency. Where is the problem?" Ongoro said. She said the commission has not investigated the construction in Kariobangi School which was completed in 2012, after a successful transfer of funds in 2009. She presented herself to EACC headquarters following an earlier summons. Another 18 suspects had also been summoned. Ongoro will appear in court on Monday. EACC has been conducting a probe into the embezzlement of Sh48,907,826 constituency funds and abuse of procurement laws by officials of  Kasarani NG-CDF. EACC CEO Twalib Mbarak had said through a statement that the anti-corruption detectives had been investigating the matter.
