Naivasha security officers have warned PSV drivers that they will be held solely responsible for any carjacking along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway during the festive season. The officers told drivers to drop the passengers at night at petrol stations or shopping centres to avoid carjackings that arise during this period. The warning was issued during a meeting between members of the Naivasha Travelers (NT) Sacco, security personnel and NTSA officials in Naivasha. Addressing the matatu operators, Naivasha OCS Alexander Korir said carjackings during the festive season mainly target passengers with money for shopping. He said they have mapped out areas where carjackers attack. He said drivers should not drop passengers at these danger spots at night, but at shopping centres or petrol stations. “We have seen passengers alight from matatus late at night, only for waiting carjackers to pounce and if this happens the drivers will be the first suspects,” he said. Korir said police were keen to work with PSV operators to reduce accidents ause by speeding and drink-driving. Chairman of the Naivasha Travelers Sacco Daniel Kimani said they were keen to stop accidents and carjackings. “We stopped all operations today so our drivers can interact with police and NTSA officers," he said. Naivasha Traffic Base Commander Rose Ndolo said most accidents can be avoided if drivers stick to the rules. noted that they were keen to address the issue of drink-driving which was common on the highway. NTSA road safety officer Chris Otieno expressed concern about fake speed governors on the market. "We are working with Safaricom so that we can know the real-time speed of PSVs as many drivers tamper with the governors," he said. (Edited by V. Graham)
