Strathmore University will miss the 2019 East and Central Africa handball Championships set for December. Strathmore had already planned to feature in the National University Games, which are coinciding with the regional event. The annual East and Central Africa handball extravaganza is set to take place in Kigali, Rwanda between December 2 and 7 where seven countries will be represented. Strathmore head coach Peter Mwathi alluded that his side is looking to defend their title at the Kenya Universities Sports Association (KUSA) national tournament, hence their absence during the regional show. He said: "We will be defending our title during the KUSA national tournament hence we cannot participate in the East and Central Africa Championships.” The East and Central Africa defending women’s champions Nairobi Water Queens, men sides Black Mamba, Kenya Defence Forces’ Ulinzi and both genders teams of National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) are among the teams yet to confirm participation. Ednah Kasandi, NCPB's assistant team manager intimated that they are waiting for the nod from their employers’ management to confirm participation. However, she remains optimistic. "As we await approval from the board’s management, we are ready for any challenge because we have prepared well. We are also using the ongoing league to gauge ourselves and polish up on a few areas,” she said. Kasandi remarked that her teams will be looking to claim both trophies in the male and female categories. She said they will not underrate any rival teams because every team is eyeing the titles. “We expect high competition from all the teams and we cannot underrating anyone. Our goal this year is to win both trophies and I believe we are up to the task,” Kasandi continued. Teams from Tanzania, Zambia, Uganda, Southern Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and Rwanda are expected to feature in the five-day bonanza.
