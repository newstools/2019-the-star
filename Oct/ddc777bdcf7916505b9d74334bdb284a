 The case in which a director of a Thika-based company that deals in land buying and selling is charged with defrauding a woman of Sh2.3 million will be mentioned on January 16, 2020. The date was set on Tuesday after Francis Kimani Njuki was arraigned before Thika resident magistrate Anne Maina. He had previously been charged with obtaining Sh2,375,000 by false pretense from Elizabeth Karigi Kamau. Kimani, a director of Henmwa Investment Limited, was charged with defrauding Karigi on diverse dates between June 17, 2010 and November 27 the same year in Thika town. He is accused of falsely pretending to sell land to Karigi. Karigi said she wooed her family to join her investment quest and together they raise the money to buy the plots. “The family could use me to transact on their behalf and he (the accused) never forgot to give me all the receipts and land certificates. I was then to wait for the issuance of title deeds,” Karigi said. Karigi said when she sought to view the plots at Kiganjo village, she was shown an undeveloped parcel that is the Kang’oki dumpsite with heaps of garbage. “When I confronted him to know the truth, he became arrogant and told me to go wherever I want. He stopped picking my calls and warned me against going to his office,” she said. Kimani, through his lawyer identified as Mr Ciuri, told the court he had resolved to settle the matter out court. Ciuri said his client was ready to pay back the money to the complainant. However, the prosecution led by state counsel Wamuyu Nguai told the court that they were not aware of any negotiations. Kimani has been out on a Sh2 million bond. Maina directed the case be mentioned on January 16, 2020.
