Political analyst Mutahi Ngunyi has asked world marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge to beat the record by winning in 1 hr 57 minutes instead of 1 hr 59 minutes. "To Eliud Kipchoge I want to say this. Kenya is in a hurry. Instead of 1.59, make it 1.57. Beat the record badly," he said on Twitter on Wednesday night. He added "Leave no doubt. And It can be done! #Eliud159." The world record holder will be attempting to clock the tape in under two hours in the 42 kilometres race dubbed Ineos 1:59 challenge. Kipchoge seeks to shatter his own record set last year at the Berlin marathon of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds. His iconic target of running the distance under two hours, dubbed “INEOS 1:59 Challenge”, will take place in the streets of Vienna. Kipchoge landed in Vienna on Tuesday morning boarding a private jet owned by Sir Jim’s Gulfstream G280. Deputy President William Ruto and Special AU envoy Raila Odinga led Kenyans in wishing Kipchoge success in his upcoming attempt. Through hash tags #Eliudkipchoge, #Ineos 1:59 Challenge and #Eliudkipchoge challenge, Kenyans passed messages of success towards Kipchoge.
