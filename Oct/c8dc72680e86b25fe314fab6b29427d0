ICT CS Joe Mucheru has been put on the spot after re-appointing a dead man to Kenya Film Classification Board. Mucheru in a gazette notice reappointed Robert Kochalle to continue serving in the KFCB board for another three years. Kochalle passed away on May 29, 2018, at Aga Khan Hospital and was a member of the KFCB board. Mucheru was put to task to explain the error, stirring a heated debate online. But KFCB CEO Ezekiel Mutua claimed that the issue was being blown out of proportion yet it was not Mucheru’s fault. "Small issue being blown out of proportion," he said.
