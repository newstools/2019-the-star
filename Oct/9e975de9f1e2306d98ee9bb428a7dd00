Butalii Warriors have withdrawn from the African Cup of Club Championship scheduled for December 1-10 in Ismailia, Egypt due to unavailability of players. Team Manager Kamal Sembi said the management had agreed to foot the players' travel and upkeep but most of them are committed at their workplace. He said: "It is very unfortunate that we won't be going for the tournament because most of our players are working and cannot get a release for that period from their employers. We were prepared to fund them if they were all available." Sembi said despite the setback, the defending champions will fight to retain the league title. Butali are top of the table with 33 pointsâ€”four more than second-placed Wazalendo with five matches left. As much as he expects competition from Police and Wazalendo, Sembi tipped his side to once again run away with the crown. He said they are counting on their experience and style of play to carry the day. "We are hoping for another league title. However, the team will have to win another three games or so and we are aware it won't be easy. Opponents always make life difficult for us although we have an upper hand because of our experience. Police and Wazalendo are waiting in the wings in case we falter," he said. There will be no men's team going for the tournament as Police had withdrawn earlier, citing logistical challenges. The ladies side will be represented by defending champions Telkom who are optimistic of winning their 11th continental title.
