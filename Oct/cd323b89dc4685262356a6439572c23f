A special police units known as “spive” in the Nyanza region have been disbanded with immediate effect. Regional police commander Vincent Makokha says spive teams in the region stand dissolved and be deployed to normal duties. Spive is a police unit that operates while undercover and is normally dressed in civilian clothing. Makokha directed that all officers within the region will now be required to operate in full police uniforms. “All officers on duty must be in uniform including petty crime and all patrol teams. Those attending court cases to do so in uniform,” he said on Saturday. Makokha said only DCI personnel are allowed civilian attire and directed all commanders in Nyanza to note and comply. This, he said, was a decision they made locally for officers in the region. The police chief said the action has been undertaken as part of crime prevention strategies in the region. He warned that stern action will be taken against any officer found armed and not in police uniform. "We want to account for every officer working in the region for effective service delivery to citizens," Makokha said. He also said that an audit of all firearms and ammunition will also be carried out within the region. “The purpose is to ensure accountability and the number of police firearms which are currently in our possession," he said. He warned criminals in the area that their days are numbered. He said patrols have been enhanced in order to ensure the same is realized. Makokha said all border regions will be put under his watch. He urged the public to volunteer information which could help in the war against crime. “The fight against crime is a collective responsibility at the end of the day,” he said.
