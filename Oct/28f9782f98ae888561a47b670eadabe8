Kenya Netball Federation president Emmaculate Kabutha has denied allegations that the national women’s team survived on loaves of bread and milk during the just concluded Africa Cup Championship in South Africa. She also negated allegations that a Cameroon national was feeding the team. Speaking upon arrival in Nairobi, the official expressed her displeasure at what she termed as ‘rumours’ about the team’s misery during the championships. Kabutha said the team received adequate support from the government and the ladies were well catered for in South Africa. Kabutha indicated that the Kenyan team was booked full board at Fomo Lodge by the government who also paid for their visas, airfare and tournament fee. “We are not happy with the false reports being milled around and we categorically distance ourselves with them. We know we have enemies of the sport who are trying to get at the ministry through us,” she said. “The ministry has really supported us since last year and we appreciate it,” added Kabutha, whose organization was recently affiliated to International Netball Federation.
