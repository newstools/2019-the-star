President Uhuru Kenyatta has said that primary and secondary school children need an early introduction to the best practices in water usage. He said teaching children at an early stage will help to avoid wastage and pollution. Uhuru's speech was read by Deputy President William Ruto during the official opening of Water and Sanitation Conference, held at the KICC on Tuesday. “In this regard, I am directing the Ministry of Education to introduce a compulsory curriculum on water and sanitation in all schools,” Uhuru said. He expressed concern that the rate of increasing access to water and sanitation services has been slow. The President said the current access to clean safe water was 62 percent while average national sewerage coverage stood at 25 percent. Present were Cabinet Secretaries Simon Chelugui (Water, Sanitation and Irrigation) and his East African Community and Regional Development counterpart Adan Mohammed.
