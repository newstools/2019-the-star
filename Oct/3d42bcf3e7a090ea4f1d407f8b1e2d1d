Three Kenyatta University students were yesterday charged with incitement to violence. Students Association chairperson Joshua Ayika Otieno, Vincent Buondo Mare and Duncan Onyango Ogila were accused of inciting other students to cause violence between October 6 and 9 at Kenyatta University Main Campus in Nairobi. The three, with others not before the court, allegedly uttered words that made students to demonstrate. The three denied the charges before Makadara court chief magistrate Heston Nyaga and were released on a Sh200,000 bond. The magistrate, however, barred  them from accessing institution’s premise until the court gives further orders. The case will be mentioned in two weeks. The prosecution counsel had objected to their release on bail, saying that before their arrest, police received information that Ayika held a press conference at the institution gate, inciting other students to riot and burn the university. “Administration is apprehensive that the accused person release might lead to further unrest and my prayer is not to release the accused person until further irreducible minimums are met,” the court was told. However, the accused objected to the application, arguing that investigations procedures ought to have been conducted before any arrests were made. He termed the detectives prayer as "media prosecution that sought to punish the accused person before conviction." While making a ruling, the magistrate said, “I am aware that accused persons are students and will need to attend classes. At the pre-trial stage, the prosecution will inform the court and status of each accused at the university for further direction.”
