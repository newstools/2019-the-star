MP Oku Kaunya has launched an ICT centre expected to help fight unemployment among the youth in Busia. His advice: Don't always depend on the state. The Sh1.1 million centre with 13 state-of-the-art laptops is hosted at Kiwimbi Community Library in Amagoro town. It is the fourth such investment supported by the Teso North MP in the constituency. The other three centres, which are already operational, are in Kolanya, Ang’urai and at the Malaba Youth Empowerment Centre in Malaba town. On Saturday the Teso North MP called on the youth to take advantage of the facilities to further their ICT knowledge and use the centres to do online jobs and earn money instead of waiting for the government to create jobs for them. The facilities are open to members of the public as well as students and pupils in the constituency. The opening of the four centres came after the successful launch of the fibre optic cable that provides high-speed internet by Safaricom in Busia and Malaba towns. Amagoro town is four kilometres away from Malaba. “I put education first. The youth can now use the internet to work online. There are many opportunities that internet provides that our young people haven’t known about and we will keep on reminding them that they need not to wait for the government to give them jobs,” the MP said during the launch on Saturday. “By using these centres, young people can become innovative and bring ideas on how to develop Teso and Kenya. They should study hard knowing that their future is bright.” Teso North in Busia as one of the highest rates of unemployment, 66.7 per cent, based on statistics from the  Busia County Integrated Development Plan for 2017-2022.
