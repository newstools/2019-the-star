The two students who went missing from Utumishi Boys Academy, Gilgil, have been traced after a one-week search. The KCSE candidates were found living with their cousins on a Nairobi estate before their parents were informed. They escaped from the school on Thursday last week in unclear circumstances. The move caused panic and fear among fellow students and their relatives. The police immediately initiated a search. One parent, Brian Nyakundi, said his son had been found safe and in good health. He blamed their action on panic over the upcoming KCSE exam, adding he had got in touch with the school management. KCSE practicals will start on Tuesday next week. The government says adequate measures have been put in place to avert malpractices. “The boys were located on an estate in Nairobi and, already, my son has gone back to school and has started to prepare for the exam,” Nyakundi said. A teacher from the school said the matter was being dealt with internally. “It’s true the students have been found hiding in Nairobi. We shall definitely take the necessary measures as part of our rules and regulations,” he said on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, there was a moment of panic on Thursday morning at a petrol station in Mai Mahiu town after a middle-aged man, who was washing a car, collapsed and died, allegedly from electrocution. Witness Simon Kariuki said they heard a loud scream before the man collapsed. He was rushed to a hospital and pronounced dead on arrival. “We suspect the death was caused by an electric fault, but police have taken over the matter and collected the body,” Kariuki said. Naivasha division police boss Samuel Waweru said an inquest file had been opened and the body taken to a mortuary. (Edited by F'Orieny)
