Tea farmers from Kisii on Friday supported Kiogoro ward MCA Samuel Apoko, who intends to table a Bill in the assembly seeking to have the National Government take over the management of the tea sector. The more than 300 farmers supported Apoko after he asked them whether they trust the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA), which has been managing the sector. Apoko was addressing mourners during the burial of Teresia Mogute, who was the first wife to athlete Nyantika Maiyoro. “I am going to table a bill in the assembly seeking to have the national government take over the management of the tea sector because KTDA has become an embarrassment. I am happy that you are all against it because of the low bonus pay,” Apoko said. The MCA noted farmers used to earn good money in terms of bonus when the government was in control of the sector. Apoko said that due to the poor bonus payment this year, some farmers have threatened to uproot their tea bushes in favour of other crops which can earn them good income. “The poor bonus pay to farmers has demonstrated that KTDA is incapable of managing the sector. I am a tea farmers and I equally feel the pinch,” he added. “I am urging you not to uproot your tea bushes. Continue with the farming as a lasting solution is being sought,” he added. Following the poor pay, two banking institution managers have since assured farmers who obtained loans they will revise repayment modalities. Robinson Mirieri, who is the manager, Equity Bank's Kisii branch, and  Wakenya Pamoja Sacco CEO  Isaac Omwenga, urged the farmers to visit the institutions to agree on how they will pay the loans. Mirieri and Omwenga said they will not compel the farmers to repay them owing to the bonus paid by KTDA.
