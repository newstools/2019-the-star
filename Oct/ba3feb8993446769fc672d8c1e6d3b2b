The Mandera Health department at the weekend carried out a two-day cancer screening exercise at the county hospital. Residents were screened for prostate, cervical and breast cancers. The services were free. Executive Shamsa Haji on Monday said the screening was part of the county government's strategy to assist residents in detecting cancer at an early stage to help in early treatment and management. She spoke at the county hospital. Doctors from the National Cancer Centre and the county Health department took part in the exercise, which also included awareness campaigns. The county targetted 200 people but only 155 had been screened by the end of the exercise. By midday Saturday, some 50 people had turned up for the test. Haji said although the most common cancer in the region is oesophagal cancer, the department was covering other cancers given that this is a cancer awareness month. Plans are underway to have a cancer clinic set up in the region to reduce treatment costs as most residents have to travel to Nairobi, she said.
