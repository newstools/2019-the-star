Kiambu Sports and Youth CEC Karungo wa Thang'wa has said plans by Kiambu MCAs to impeach him are more political than factual. In a statement on Thursday, Thang'wa said the move is meant to malign his name and settle political scores. His sentiments come a day after 34 out of 92 Kiambu MCAs signed a motion to impeach him. The notice of motion was tabled at the county assembly by nominated MCA Margaret Njeri. The ward reps accused the executive of incompetence, gross misconduct and abuse of office. His impeachment case is set to be tabled next week. Thang'wa has, however,  dispelled the claims. He has called upon the county assembly to Accord him an opportunity to set the record straight. "In line with the constitutional principles of accountability and transparency. I welcome all media house to provide live coverage when I appear before the committee," Thang'wa said. He said the Kiambu youth deserve to know every detail regarding the county's planned programmes and the reasons behind their stalling. "I promise I will not shy away from letting you know the truth," Thang'wa said. In July, Thang'wa was summoned by the assembly committee on youth and sports after being accused of ignoring the MCAs whenever called upon to answer to queries arising from his department. The queries included claims that Sh5.5 million was spent on the Super Cup tournament to award teams and for transport logistics and training of coaches, referees and officials. The tournament was not completed with participants claiming they were not paid despite money being used. The MCAs said the department unnecessarily spent Sh1.9 million in the launch of the tournament. However, Thangwa defended the tournament, saying it was conducted with live media coverage and to acceptable standards. He said less money was spent as compared to other county government functions.
