Hardly 24 hours after World record holder Eliud Kipchoge broke the sub-two hour barrier in Vienna, another Kenyan, Brigid Kosgei followed suit after smashing the women's marathon record. Kosgei clocked 2:14:04 to break the 16-year old record held by British Paula Radcliffe by a massive minute and 21 seconds. Kosgei, 25, etched her name in history books for becoming the youngest marathoner to win the London Marathon early this year where she clocked 2:18:20. Ethiopa's Ababel Yeshaneh was second in Chicago, six minutes 47 seconds behind. Meanwhile, another Kenyan and reigning Boston Marathon champion Lawrence Cherono claimed the men's race, clocking 2:05:42. Cherono, who was making his second appearance in a senior marathon, said the pacesetters withdrew barely 30 kilometres into the race but managed to soldier on.
