Residents of Sophia, Mwakingali and Mabomani villages in Voi subcounty are living in fear after a stray wild cat killed more than 20 goats. Schoolchildren and residents could be next, they say, demanding action from KWS. Bazil Maghanga, whose four goats were mauled on Tuesday night, said the wild animal believed to be a cheetah has teen terrorising villagers for more than a week in Taita Taveta. Maghanga said he helplessly watched as the cheetah killed his goats. “I heard a commotion outside my house around midnight only to find four of my goats killed. We have contacted the Kenya Wildlife Service officers but nothing has been done,” he said. He said the continued human-wildlife conflict has undermined peace. John Bombo said he lost two goats on Monday night. He asked KWS to swiftly capture and relocate the animal to the park. The cat may have escaped from the neighbouring Tsavo East National Park. “We cannot continue suffering while KWS offices are just a stone's throw away. Let them deploy their officers to drive back the animal. We need compensation as well for the losses we have incurred,” Bombo said. Most parts of the region have experienced human-wildlife conflict resulting in deaths, destruction of property and injuries. Last year, a stray lion believed to have escaped from Tsavo National Park killed 70 livestock in Chawia, Teri and Susu villages in Mwatate constituency. Bombo faulted KWS for delayed compensation for victims, pointing out that hundreds of farmers had not received compensation despite filing official complaints. Efforts to contact KWS senior community warden Zainab Salim were unsuccessful as calls and messages were not answered. Statistics from the County Wildlife Compensation and Conservation Committee have revealed that there are more than 800 pending compensation cases in the county. At least 1,500 compensation claims have been processed since 2014 and are awaiting payments. Edited by R.Wamochie
