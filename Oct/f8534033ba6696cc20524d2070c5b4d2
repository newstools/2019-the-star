Zari Hassan claims she spent over Sh244,000 for a flight from Dubai, only to land and find out that her four expensive perfumes were stolen. “So disappointed in Kenya airlines. I’ve been loyal, but you always do me wrong. The other times I’ve ignored, but not today. All the perfumes I received as gifts from my friends in Dubai just disappeared,” she wrote on Instagram. Zari sent the official of Kenya Airways a warning demanding her stuff back. "You have my return date, better make sure someone finds me in the lounge and returns what belongs to me. I didn’t travel for free, you set me back $2,440, now I want what’s mine back period! And we will end this relationship in peace.” She went on to add that the new suit she was supposed to wear for a meeting was also missing. “What am I supposed to wear for my meeting? Let’s not ignore the fact that your flights are always delayed and no explanations are given to passengers, still I ignored. I’ve never been on a KQ flight that’s on time. Shame on you."
