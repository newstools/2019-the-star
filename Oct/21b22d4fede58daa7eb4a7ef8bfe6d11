A widow in Lunga Lunga subcounty wants justice for her husband, who was murdered last week in Kanana village. Judith Auma said her husband George Odhiambo, 45, was attacked by unknown people on the night of September 24 while on his way home. “My husband was on his way home when a gang attacked him at around 9pm,” she said. The matter was reported to Shimoni police station but no one has been arrested, she said. “We have been talking to the police, but they have not arrested any suspect. If nothing is done, my husband’s case is likely to be forgotten,” she said. According to Auma, the postmortem report shows that Odhiambo succumbed to injuries to the head and leg inflicted with a panga and a pickaxe. Auma said her husband was a loving, generous and peace-loving man. She said she does not understand why anyone would want to hurt her husband. Auma urged well-wishers to assist in the burial arrangements since the family is poor. Police said investigations are ongoing and they will provide a report once the perpetrators are identified.
