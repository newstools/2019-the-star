The dispute over the late Kibra MP Ken Okoth siring a son with Nairobi MCA Anne Nthumbi ended on Wednesday after the parties agreed to close the matter. The MP's widow Monica accepted that her husband is the father of Anne Nthumbi's son. In a consent filed in court, Monica, Okoth's mother and Nthumbi asked the court to mark the matter as closed. They agreed that Okoth is the minor's biological father. "The DNA results obtained by the applicant indicate that the alleged father is not excluded as the biological father of the tested child," the consent reads in part. Lawyer Danstan Omari for Thumbi said they will now move to the High Court to deal with issues of succession since there is no contest on the child's paternity. "This matter be marked as closed as other matters are to be dealt with by the High Court in the probate and administration division," the consent says. The parties agreed that each of them shall bear their costs of the petition that was filed by Nthumbi. Principal magistrate Margaret Obura adopted the consent and marked the case as closed. Speaking outside the court, Ntumbi’s lawyers said there was no one contesting the paternity of the child. Last month, Monica told the court she had different DNA results from the ones Nthumbi filed in court. Monica wanted to present the results to the court before any further hearing. Nthumbi had moved to court seeking to have her son recognized as the only heir to the late MP. The court then temporarily stopped the burial and later the parties agreed to conduct a DNA test on the minor to ascertain his paternity. Focus now shifts to the High Court where the battle moves to as Nthumbi's lawyers said they would seek to find out what the boy is entitled to from his late father’s wealth.
