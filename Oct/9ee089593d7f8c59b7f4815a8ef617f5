Vihiga United must cut out their wastefulness if they are to fulfil their goal of returning to the topflight league next year, reckons coach  Sammy Okoth. Vihiga dominated their National Super League fixture against Administration Police last weekend but would ultimately settle for a 1-1 draw, a result that left Okoth utterly frustrated. “We are creating a lot of chances but not making them count. The game against AP, was not the first time we have had so many goal scoring chances and failed to score. It’s disappointing and it is something that we will work on as a team if we are to meet our goal of returning to KPL,” said Okoth. Vihiga’s draw on Sunday left them with 13 points from seven matches, six adrift of runaway leaders Nairobi City Stars. City Stars edged Police 3-2 in a five-goal thriller in a perfect weekend for them, which saw the teams closest to them lose. Bidco United were beaten  1-0 by lowly St. Joseph while  Nairobi Stima lost at home to Migori Youth by a similar score line and Talanta were held to a 1-1 draw by debutants APS Bomet. “This league is tough any team can take points from the other. That is why it is frustrating when my team do not kill off matches when we are dominating. Hopefully, it will change in our next game," remarked Okoth. Vihiga will return to home comforts on Friday when they take on Kibera Black Stars.
