Over 80 drivers have confirmed participation in the Laikipia Amateur Fun Race set for November 23. The event will cut across several conservancies and villages on the scenic northern segment of the region, covering a gruelling distance of 180km. The participants will navigate through Laikipia’s wild with the noble objective of promoting peaceful co-existence amongst more than 24 tribes living in Laikipia. Laikipia County executive committee member in charge of trade, tourism, cooperative and Industrial development, Biwott Tirop said the race will traverse over 8 conservancies with a variety of wildlife including the big five. Sponsored by the County Government of Laikipia and Destination Laikipia, the race will rev off in Nanyuki and finish in Louniek near Mugie Conservancy but not before tasting the rigours of the picturesque landscape in the wild. The race is open to 2WD and 4X4s and it is designed with spectators in mind. Throughout the event, there will be safety marshals who will be on location to guide competitors who stray from the course. Ongoing torrential rains are also expected to spice up the race with mud-splattering sections sure to treat the race traffic to some scintillating displays. Laikipia Amateur Fun Race has taken place twice and one of the success stories of the project is Community Social Responsibility (CSR) activities, which they contribute towards communities’ well-being.
