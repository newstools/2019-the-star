Transport CS James Macharia has announced twice that the order blocking truckers from ferrying cargo from Mombasa Port has been suspended. The announcement followed concerns about job losses in long-haul transport because the sector employs thousands of people directly and indirectly. The impact the decision would have on struggling households would be financially and socially devastating. The government must weigh the lives needy Kenyans against the financial targets of the SGR behemoth that has been declining, hence, the order on mandatory SGR hauling. Even with Macharia'sassurances, truckers and traders have refused to relent. They want the 'illegal' order rescinded, not suspended and say their access to the port is still limited. They demonstrate weekly in Mombasa. The government must translate words into action, ensure truckers can enter and scrap that order. Failure to act will reinforce the perception that bureaucrats are insincere. What other conclusions could be drawn from denial of free access? Reassurances ring hollow. Kenya is a capitalist state where unfettered competition is the hallmark of supply and demand for goods and services. The government must allow customers to decide how they want their cargo transported from Mombasa. The competition from which SGR is being shielded is the surest way to test its viability.
