Some Embu farmers have agreed not to uproot their tea bushes as they had threatened to do over low prices. Former Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti has urged farmers in upper Embu to wait for the government to intervene and prices to improve. Kivuti said it’s too early for farmers to give up hope, adding that President Uhuru Kenyatta’s government is seeking to improve the sector. He spoke at Kiritiri where he met residents. The former legislator encouraged farmers to take care of their tea bushes and be patient. He said brokers are the biggest problems facing the subsector and that they should be eliminated. He said if he becomes governor in 2022, he will streamline the sector to the maximum and ensure farmers reap the profit they are entitled to. Tea farmers in the county have threatened to uproot their tea bushes if prices don't improve. Kivuti narrowly lost the governor's seat to Martin Wambora by less than a thousand votes. He said God did not want him to win that year "but in 2022". He said he is waiting for his time to take over from Wambora "and move the county to the next transformational level". Kivuti said during his time as senator, he used his cash to educate many children who could not afford school fees and today they are benefitting after finishing their studies. Edited by R.Wamochie
