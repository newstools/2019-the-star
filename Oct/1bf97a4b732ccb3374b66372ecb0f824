The government has put in place measures to ensure students in Nyeri continue with their exams in case of floods. County commissioner David Kipkemei said no major challenges are expected except in Kieni constituency, where roads are bad. Some 18,325 candidates in secondary schools will sit their exams in 243 examination centres, while 17,300 KCPE candidates will be examined in 505 centres across the county. The exams are slated to start next week. “It is interesting because in Nyeri, the secondary school candidates are more than the primary school candidates,” he said. He spoke in his office in Nyeri town on Tuesday after a meeting that brought together all subcounty examination managers who are the subcounties directors of education. Others in the meeting were subcounty directors of the TSC, subcounty security committees, Kenya Primary School Headteachers Association, Kuppet and Knut officials. The aim of the meeting, he said, was to ensure coordination during the exam. “I can confidently say that we are well-prepared for the exams. We have deployed 881 security officers who will escort the exams and guard examination containers for 24 hours,” he said. The officers, he added, will be escorting all exams from the containers to the exam centres and back. He said measures have also been put in place to ensure there are no people in the centres other than those concerned with the exams. The government recently closed some schools for failing to meet standards, but Kipkemei said no examination centre had been closed.
