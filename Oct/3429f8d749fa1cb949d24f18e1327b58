Two contractors were charged yesterday before a Milimani court with evading Sh35.7 million tax. Yussuf Khalif Bulle and Abdirahim Osman Yarrow appeared before chief magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot. They denied wrongdoing. They were granted Sh100,000 bail each. The case will be heard on December 4. The suspects, who are both directors of El-Yumo Contractors Limited, jointly faced 11 counts, which involve failure to pay taxes. They also faced charges of falsifying accounts statements to reduce tax liability and failure to file tax returns all happening between the year 2014 and 2018. According to the police, the accused, in their statements, deliberately failed to declare taxable income by filing nil returns and failed to declare the correct amounts of taxable income to reduce value-added tax (VAT) liability for different years of income.
