After failing in her maiden call up to make it to the final squad of Harambee Starlets team citing passport issues, Wadadia shot-stopper Monicah Odato hopes to finally make her debut when the team meets Zambia in the fourth round of the CAF Women Tokyo 2020 Olympic qualifiers next month. Odato, a fourth-year student at Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST) in Kakamega has been a first-choice for her club. Her rich vein of form earned her a place in the provisional squad to face Ghana in a two-legged encounter but a late passport application denied her the opportunity to repay the coach's faith. The 24-year old, whose talent was unearthed while in Form One at Ibinzo Girls Secondary School in Kakamega County, is optimistic she can finally make her mark in the national team during the upcoming assignment slated for between November 4 and 12. She said: "It was very unfortunate that I had to postpone my dream of donning the Kenyan stripes. Actually, I was psyched up for Ghana matches but could not make it.Â  I had applied for the passport but its duration had not yet reached prior to the team's departure to face Ghana Black Queens. All is not lost however because the coming round offers another opportunity." "I earned my position while in form one. I knew I had the talent before being spotted by the coaches," remarked Odato. The ball-playing custodian hopes everything will have been sorted out before the encounter. Should she earn another opportunity with David Ouma's team, Odato will have a fight on her hands to make the starting line up. Annet Kundu of Eldoret Falcons and Gaspo Youth's Judith Osimbo were selected for Ghana clash, with the former starting in goal. Starlets drew 0-0 with Ghana away before 1-0 extra-time victory at Moi sports, Kasarani. The team will step up their preparations by resuming training next week.
