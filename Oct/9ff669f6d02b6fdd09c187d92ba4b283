A city cleric has called on religious leaders to support Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko’s administration in weeding out corruption and developing the county. Bishop John Nduati of Power Church and Ministry on Sunday said Sonko has done a commendable job in helping the helpless, especially the elderly who had lost land to cartels in the city. “Let’s all support our governor because he works for all of us and he shows no discrimination. We have all seen him partnering with the national government in eradicating cartels in the city, hence he deserves support from all stakeholders,” Nduati said during a pastors seminar in Kiambu. Nduati said Sonko’s administration has protected churches, mosques and learning institutions from land grabbers. The cleric also supported Sonko on the  suspension 16 county officials following last month’s collapse of a school building, which left eight pupils dead and over 60 injured. The accident occurred at the Precious Talent School in Ngando ward, Dagoretti. The owner of the school, Moses Wainaina, was charged with manslaughter on Monday and released on Sh500,000 bail. Suspended city officers include Finance executive and Sonko's Mr Fix It Charles Kerich. The governor appointed Pauline Kahiga as acting Finance executive. Sonko assured Nairobi residents he would not leave any stone unturned until  he reverses the effects of the impunity of a few rogue officials within the Urban Planning Department. “I am convinced beyond doubt that drastic measures have to be taken to reverse the effects of years of flouting Physical Planning regulations and restore order and sanity before illegal structures claim more lives as has repeatedly happened before,” Sonko said after the incident.
