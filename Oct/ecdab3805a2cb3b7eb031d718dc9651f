Rapper Khaligraph Jones says he spoke out against the peanuts paid by the Music Copyright Society of Kenya for the sake of the fast-rising Gengetone kids who have not learnt the ropes of the music industry yet. “As far as getting paid goes, there have been talks however I haven’t attended any meetings. It has even reached the President and they want to straighten this thing,” he told word Is on Friday. “Artistes should not fear to ask questions about their money. I have been in the industry for long and I know how the industry is. “There are so many artists coming up and the Kenyan industry has changed. I spoke on their behalf so that they don’t go through what I have gone through. I raised this issue to get a solution. These artistes are depending on the music.” The Mazishi hitmaker says he will, however, work with the Gengetone artistes when need be. “When I see the reason for working with them, then I will. These kids are doing well on their own. Right now, everyone is jumping to what they are doing.” Jones is currently trending with Khali Cartel 3 featuring Bey T, Breeder Lw, Silverstone Barz, Rekles and Chiwawa. “It was nice working with all of them. As long as you are a rapper, it is always easy for them to get into the studio and do something big. Everyone wrote their own lyrics. I just gave an arrangement to the song. They followed the direction and the song was done.” Last year, Jones won an Afrimma award for best African rap act and has been nominated again this year. “The thing is to motivate people. In Kenyan hip hop, no one has ever been nominated for things like those and to top it all,win. It was something that was done by people all over Africa. I was the only hip hop artiste from our country,” Jones said. “If I say that music has helped me be here, I’ll be lying. I have pushed myself. I am from the ghetto...There are others who have been in this game for long and haven’t accomplished what I have been able to do.”
