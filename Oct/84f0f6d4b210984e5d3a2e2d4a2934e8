After landing his maiden call to the national team, AFC Leopards and Rwandese defender Soter Kayumba has revealed that the Amavubi will be seeking redemption in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations after missing out of the last edition. Rwanda were missing in action as Cecafa colleagues Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi and Uganda participated in the 32nd edition of the biannual tournament held in Egypt between June 23 to July 19. This was despite boasting of accomplished players like the trio of Meddie Kagere, Haruna Niyonzima and Jacques Tuyisenge. Rwanda are placed in Pool 'F' of the qualifiers with 2017 champions Cameroon who have already qualified by virtue of being the hosts, Cape Verde and Mozambique. Kayumba, who was elevated to the rank of field captain at Leopards following the absence of the injured Robinson Kamura, said they will be seeking to emulate their regional counterparts. Kayumba will be making his first appearance in Vincent Mashami's Amavubi Stars in an away match against Mozambique on November 11. “I have already been summoned for the qualifiers and truth be told we have to redeem ourselves this time around. "We did not qualify for the past edition and the unfortunate bit is we were the only team from the region who did not qualify for Afcon. "We have learnt something and we have to take the qualifiers seriously. I have worked hard and earned a place in the national team for the first team,” he said. The former Sofapaka player described the Kenyan Premier League as the ‘best within the region and credited it for his call to the national team. “I had never played elsewhere before I came to Kenya. KPL is one of the best leagues we have around, even though it is a little bit physical. I have learnt for the one and a half years I have been here and improved as a defender.”
