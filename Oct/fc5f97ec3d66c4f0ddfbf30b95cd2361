Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination results will be out before Christmas Day, Education CS George Magoha has said. "Candidates should know the school they are going to by Christmas. This will enable their parents to prepare them," Magoha told journalists on Thursday in Kibra. "These candidates will receive grades that belong to them for there was no exam that leaked." Magoha said some 20 examination centers begun late on the first and the second day. "This was due to logistical problems associated with bad weather and chopper operations," he said. Magoha said there was three centres -Nyandarua, West Pokot and Garissa - where cheating was stopped before it happened. "I am happy that the TSC has taken action. I have no sympathy at all. The full force of the law will take place," he said. "The involvement of my colleagues in this process is here to stay until we achieve our goals." Magoha said less than 10 incidents of attempted examination fraud had been reported. "This is good news. It seems parents are speaking to students," he said. The CS said the Education Ministry will now shift its focus to the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education set to commence on Monday.
