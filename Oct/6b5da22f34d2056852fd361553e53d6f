The government plans to vaccinate about 800,000 girls aged 10 against the human papillomavirus — a sexually transmitted infection that can cause cervical cancer. The programme is to be led by the Health ministry and will cost Sh21.6 billion. The government is funding the programme with support from Unicef. Narok county health promotion officer Carol Saitoti said the campaign to begin later this month targets 52,000 girls. She made the remarks during a health stakeholders meeting held in Narok. “We want to protect this age group before they become sexually active as the HPV virus is transmitted through sex with a male partner who is a carrier,” Saitoti said. She said the cervical cancer vaccine known as Gardasil works best when administered at age 11 and 12 years but due to financial constraints, only girls born in 2009 will benefit. “Maybe later we can consider up to the age of 13,” Saitoti said. Health teams will be deployed to schools and homes, she said, urging parents and other stakeholders and faith-based organisations to support this initiative. The girls will receive two doses at an interval of six months. Both doses cost Sh27,000 per girl. Reports from the World Health Organization say about 2,706 cervical cancer deaths occur in Kenya every year. The vaccines will be available at Sh9,000 in private, public and faith-based health facilities in the country. Cervical cancer is the fourth commonest cancer worldwide and the most prevalent form of cancer among women in Kenya. (edited by O. Owino)
