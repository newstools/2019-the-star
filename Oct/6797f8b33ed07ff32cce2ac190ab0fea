 A KCPE candidate from Migori has threatened to commit suicide after he found his name missing on the list of those to sit the exam. The boy was a learner at a private academy in Migori town but was allegedly registered to sit the exam at a nearby public school. He said he realised his name was missing when he joined the other 20 candidates who were rehearsing for the test on Monday. The KCPE exam kicked off countrywide on Tuesday. “On Monday, I was told to come in the morning and sit the Mathematics exam but was shocked when I was locked out because my name was missing,” the boy told the Star on Tuesday. He said he was going to commit suicide if he misses the exam. He was harbouring ambitions of becoming an engineer. “We knew our son was going to sit the exam and he was well prepared. He has been performing well, but we are afraid of losing him because he may commit suicide,” his mother said. On Tuesday, Higher Education PS Colleta Suda oversaw the distribution of exam papers across Migori from the county commissioner’s office. Suda said the ministry was ready to deal with cheating. “The education officers and other stakeholders are on the lookout for any pilferage of exam materials,” Suda said. County police commander Joseph Nthenge urged stakeholders to shun engagements that might compromise the quality of the exam. He said security had been strengthened to allow the exam proceed smoothly.  edited by peter obuya
