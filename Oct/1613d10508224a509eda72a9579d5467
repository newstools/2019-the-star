Property of unknown value was lost as a dawn fire razed a bar and vehicles at Kathageri area of Embu East on Sunday. No one was injured during the 2am incident. Residents said that they rushed to the scene to try put off the fierce fire. However, their efforts were futile as the premises are near an electric pole that connects power to neighbouring businesses. "At one time we had to run from electric sparks emanating from a pole that connects the premises to electricity," a resident said. The residents have urged the county government to consider putting a proper disaster management system in case of an accident. They said Runyenjes has no fire engine and they only depend on the one from Embu town, 32 kilometres away. "We need a fire engine in Runyenjes to avert the loss of property and lives during fire incidents," Paul Mugo said. Mugo said that the residents used buckets to put off the fire. He said that it was unfortunate for the residents to be complaining of perennial loss of property, a situation that can be contained with fire engines nearby. Police in Runyenjes are investigating the incident to determine the cause of the fire.
