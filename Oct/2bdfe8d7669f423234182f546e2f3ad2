Kenya's inflation has risen to 4.95 per cent from 3.83 per cent in September, latest figures from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics show. KNBS attributed the increase in October to higher food prices, which have led to a costlier food basket altogether. “Prices of several foodstuffs were significantly higher during the month under review compared to the prices recorded during the previous month,” KNBS director general Zachary Mwangi said in a statement. The data shows, the prices of maize grain, sifted maize flour and tomatoes grew by 5.82, 4.58 and 4.44 per cent respectively, driving up the year-on-year food and non-alcoholic drinks index to 8.74 per cent in October from 6.31 per cent the preceding month. Households bought a kilo of loose maize grains at Sh50.82 in October as compared to 48.02 in September 2019. A kilo of beans retailed at Sh 124.03 in October up from Sh121.21 in September. According to the monthly survey, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and narcotics index grew by 1.97 per cent driven largely by an increase in the cost of cigarettes following the increase in excise tax. On the other hand the transport index recorded a 0.27 percentage point drop attributed to a decrease in fuel pump prices of petrol and diesel. Two kg of sifted maize retailed at Sh125.40 up from Sh119.91,  two kg wheat flour from Sh126.56 to Sh126.31 in October. A kilo of sugar decreased from Sh106.15 to Sh104.72. During the same period, prices of spinach cabbages and sugar dropped by 4.6, 5.4 and 1.35 per cent. The year on year food and non alcoholic drinks inflation increased from 6.31 per cent in September 2019 to 8.74 in October.
