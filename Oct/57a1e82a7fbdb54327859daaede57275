The traffic death toll across the country continues to rise after two men died on the spot after crashing along the Nairobi-Nakuru Highway. The two drivers died near Soysambu Farm after their lorry and canter crashed on Sunday Morning. The accident came barely two days after three people died along the same highway in Naivasha following a collision involving a pick-up truck and a lorry. The latest accident occurred after the canter, which had two occupants, rammed into the oncoming trailer killing the two drivers on the spot. Gilgil OCPD Emmanuel Opuru confirmed the accident adding that the mangled wrecks had been towed to the area police station. He blamed the rising number of accidents along the highway on careless overtaking and speeding adding that the traffic department was keen to address this. “The injured have been taken to Gilgil Subcounty Hospital while the bodies are lying in the facility mortuary awaiting postmortem,” he said. Matatu driver Sam Karanja said the driver of the canter was trying to overtake a fleet of vehicles. Karanja said the driver underestimated the speed of the trailer leading to the accident that temporarily paralysed the flow of traffic. “The accident occurred very fast and in the process, both drivers died on the spot while their passengers were seriously injured,” he said. Earlier, a motorcycle operator was hit and killed by a perrsonal vehicle in Naivasha along the same highway. Witness James Kabono said the operator who had bought some vegetables from a roadside market was joining the highway when he was hit. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru confirmed the incident adding that an inquest file had been opened and the body taken to the local mortuary. Edited by R.Wamochie
