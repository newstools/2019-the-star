Rainfall is expected to continue pounding various parts of the country for the next five days, the Meteorological Department has said. In a statement by Director of the Kenya Meteorological Department Stella Aura on, rains are expected to start intensifying in most parts of the country from Tuesday. "Heavy rainfall (more than 30mm) will be experienced in Siaya, Kisumu, Homa Bay, Migori, Kisii, Nyamira, Trans Nzoia and Baringo in the next five days," read the statement. Aura said that most parts of the country are likely to experience above-average rainfall during the month of October. "The October 2019 rainfall is  well distributed, both in time and space, over the better part of the country except for Northwestern Kenya,"she said. The weatherman indicates Nairobi, the coastal strip, Nyandarua, Nyeri, Laikipia, Murang'a and Moyale will experience light rains for the next five days. The five-day forecast, however, says that Northeastern and Northwestern regions, counties of Turkana, West Pokot, Samburu, Mandera,  Garissa, and Isiolo will have temperatures hit an average high of 33 degrees and depressed rainfall. Marsabit and Wajir will have temperatures hit as high of 38 degrees. Aura has therefore advised that contingency plans and strategies to be put in place to avert conflict that might occur in the Northwestern and Northeastern due to the scramble for limited resources caused by poor rains. "Human-wildlife and inter-community conflicts over the limited resources are likely to be on the increase in these areas. Contingency plans and strategies should, therefore, be in place to avert such incidences." She also said flood-prone areas such as Budalang’i, Kano areas, Western Kenya and Central Highlands areas such as Murang' a are prone to floods beginning in November. She, therefore, called for the National Disaster Operations Centre to ensure mitigation of the floods in the aforementioned places.
