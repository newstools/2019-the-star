TheÂ  Kenyan Premier League Governing Council yesterday has resolved that the 2019-20 season shall proceed as scheduled and that clubs must abide by the set rules. In making the decision, the Council acknowledged that there is a financial crisis in the league and clubs after the withdrawal of the main sponsor, Sportpesa. "However, the League is committed to continuously improve the product, use football as a force for good, support football development and act with integrity for the sake of its reputation and sanity," read a statement signed by KPL CEO Jack Oguda. "As it stands, we have approached various corporates but due to the current economic situation in the country, the offers being tabled do not meet the demands of the League. It takes time to formalise any sponsorship deal since most corporates operate on running budgets which were already set at the beginning of their respective financial year The chairman of KPL clubs, who are members of the council, formally pleaded with the Government to step in and provide a short term financial solution to facilitate the smooth running of the League. "Notably, some of the teams are actually struggling to honour both local and international matches whilst players and officials risk losing their employment. Our further appeal is specifically extended to the PS State Department of Sports, Ministry of Sports, Culture & Heritage to fast track the completion of Nyayo National Stadium which is the best arena to showcase the League," the Council said in their release. They concluded by suggesting that in the long run, the Government should help clubs lobby for a change in the legal regime governing sports in the country which they believe would help in self-sustainability. In addition, the council appealed for more tax incentives to corporates supporting sport and to other stakeholders to come and support football.
