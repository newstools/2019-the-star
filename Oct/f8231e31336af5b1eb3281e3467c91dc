Kenya’s national under 20 team will be seeking to make history today when they take on Tanzania in the final of the Cecafa Challenge Cup at the Fufa Technical Center starting at 4 pm. The two teams had met earlier in the group stages with the contest ending even following a 2-2 draw but coach Stanley Okumbi revealed his side have extra motivation going into their first-ever regional final at this level. Both sides endured tough semi-finals with Stars needing a late own goal to see of Eritrea while Tanzania scraped to a 2-1 victory over Sudan. “I must congratulate the boys for showing great character in all the matches we have played. The semifinal (against Eritrea) was specifically tough but my players played their hearts out and I am pleased with the outcome,” said Okumbi. “We have an even tougher challenge in the final and I am confident that if we give a good account of ourselves as we have done since the tournament started, we can take home a positive result.” In comparison to the group stages where they scored goals for fun, Rising Stars have found goals had to come by in the knockout phase. Lead striker Sydney Lokale has had to make do with bench duties as his head seemed to have been turned by his prospective move from Kariobangi Sharks to a Finnish club. Okumbi will, however, need Lokale fully-focused to support the likes of Bernard Ochieng and Patrick Otieno, who have shared the goal-scoring duties in his absence from the starting 11. Chris Owino, who sat out the semi-final victory over Eritrea, is likely to be restored to the starting line up, having come through training on Friday after his freak injury in the group stages.
