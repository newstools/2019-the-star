Commuters plying the Lamu-Garsen road are disappointed with the slow pace with which the construction is being conducted. Most parts of the 135km stretch are in deplorable condition, a situation commuters say has made travelling a nightmare. The Sh10.8 billion tender for construction of the road was handed to the H-Young company in 2017 but nothing much has happened since. Road users are now concerned and many suspect the project will never be completed. Commuters have complained about the state of the road especially during the rainy season when parts of it become impassable. They attributed the increased road accidents and recent fatalities to the state of the road. They want the work given to a more capable contractor who will understand their challenges and the need for a new road. “During summer, the dust on this road can kill you. At times like now when it's raining daily, the road is slippery and that’s why accidents have become a norm. We no longer get startled when we hear a vehicle got into an accident here, it's always expected with the state of this road,” driver Swaleh Hassan said. The commuters are urging the government to have the contractor work on parts of the road which are in a worse state to enable smooth operations. “We have areas like Milihoi, Koreni, Pangani and Maisha Masha that normally flood when it rains. They should work on such areas first. They have begun with areas that have no issues at all and its not helping,” another driver Jackson Kariuki said. Travellers now spend extra hours from Lamu to Mombasa as drivers are now forced to drive at a snail's pace to avert accidents. During his last visit to Lamu early this year, Kenya National Highways Authority chairperson Erastus Mwongela said the road would be completed by 2020. Edited by R.Wamochie
