Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja has survived an impeachment attempt by MCAs. The Senate committee that probed his proposed ouster by the county assembly of Taita Taveta on Thursday dismissed the grounds advanced by the MCAs. The Taita Taveta MCAs impeached Samboja over alleged gross violation of the law. All the 30 MCAs were present in the House supported the impeachment motion. The motion was moved by Deputy Majority Leader Harris Keke. Keke claimed the governor grossly violated the law by misappropriating public funds and inciting the public against the assembly. The committee said the allegations against the governor were not substantiated. Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka ruled that there will be no further debate or vote taken. He, however, gave members an opportunity to give general comments on the matter. The Senate last week appointed an 11-member special committee to probe the grounds advanced by the county assembly in impeaching him. The committee comprised of Senators George Khaniri (Vihiga), Agnes Zani (nominated), Ochillo Ayacho (Migori), Aaron Cheruiyot (Kericho), Boniface Kabaka (Machakos) and Njeri Ndwiga (Embu). Others are Beatrice Kwamboka (nominated), Naomi Waqo (nominated), Farhya Ali (nominated), Charles Kibiru (Kirinyaga) and Steve Lelegwe (Marsabit). Samboja slammed the MCAs for passing the motion saying that he was ready to walk the path of impeachment. â€œThe road to impeaching a governor is long and winding, it is the one that Samboja is willing to take to the end," Samboja said through the County Communications Director Denis Onsarigo who told the Star. "They are only interested in getting a share of what they think is rightfully theirs in the budget."
