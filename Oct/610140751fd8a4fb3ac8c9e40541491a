The national men's handball team will be targeting a top-seven finish at the Olympic qualifiers-cum-African Cup of Nation's, which will help them secure a ticket to the World Championships. The team got a favourable draw in the continental tournament, which will be held in Tunisia from January 16-26 next year. Kenya are in Pool 'A' alongside 2018 runners up Egypt, Democratic Republic of Congo DRC and Guinea. Head coach Peter Mwathi, who doubles up as the Strathmore University tactician, said the draw is friendly, where he expects his team to win at least two matches to proceed to the next round. Mwathi said: "The draw is good and kind to us. We need to plan well against Guinea and DRC to find ourselves in the quarters. We will do analysis on DRC because a lot of their players ply their trade in France and the match will be like a final because we will have cleared with Guinea by the time we play them." "Egypt are the best in Africa with quality players in their squad. I am made to understand that in the last edition, they brought their u23 team and it shows how serious they are. We have to be among the top seven teams for the automatic ticket to the World Championships to be held in 2012, Egypt." "Nyayo and Kasarani are potential training grounds but we are waiting for confirmation of where we will train. It is a totally a new team with only three players retained from the previous," said Mwathi. "They should find it easy to adjust to my tactics as we build for the future. The three we have stuck with have key roles in their positions. Possibly, we will be training in the evening." The continental champion qualifies directly for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
