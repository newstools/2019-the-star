West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski has been ruled out for at least two months with a torn hip muscle. The Pole, 34, suffered the injury taking a goal-kick during West Ham’s 2-2 draw at Bournemouth on Saturday and was substituted in the 34th minute. He was the Hammers’ player of the season for 2018-19 and started all 38 league games. Roberto Jimenez, 33, replaced Fabianski at Bournemouth for his league debut, having signed for free in May. West Ham’s only other senior goalkeeper is David Martin, 33, who joined on a free transfer from Millwall in the summer but is yet to play for the club. West Ham are currently fourth in the Premier League and have not lost since defeat by Manchester City on the opening day. Meanwhile, Liverpool’s matches at the Fifa Club World Cup in Qatar will be played in a stadium built for the 2022 World Cup. The new Education City Stadium in Doha will host Liverpool’s semi-final on 18 December - the same date as the final of the next World Cup will take place. Fifa has moved the World Cup to a new slot in winter because of the oppressive summer heat in Qatar. The Gulf nation is currently hosting the World Athletics Championships, which have suffered from low crowds. The Club World Cup will be the next major event there, with Liverpool taking part as Europe’s representatives, having won the Champions League in May. Jurgen Klopp’s Premier League leaders automatically go into a semi-final where they could play local side Al Sadd, managed by Spain great Xavi, Hienghene Sport of New Caledonia or Mexican side Monterey. They will remain at the 40,000-seater stadium for either the final or third-place play-off on 21 December.
