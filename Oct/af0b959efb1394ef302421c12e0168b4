Last evening marked three days since a car carrying Mariam Kighenda and her daughter Amanda Mutheu, four, slid off a Likoni Ferry and sank in the Indian Ocean. By press time, the car had not been recovered, though Transport CS James Macharia set up a team headed by his PS to lead the recovery. It was only yesterday that Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho moved to fly in divers from South Africa. The way this operation has been handled has angered many Kenyans at a time the Kenya Navy is practising for Mashujaa Day in the same area. Even more disturbing is how Kenya Ferry Services has handled the operations that exposed that it is not only ill-equipped but also incompetent. What happened to chains and restraints to keep vehicles onboard? That Mariam and her daughter Amanda are still at the bottom of the sea nearly 72 hours later is a national shame and tragedy. How is it that the KFS Board and management are still in office? Why hasnâ€™t the Principal Secretary responsible taken responsibility? Why has the CS responsible not taken responsibility? What kind of moral degeneration is this? President Kenyatta should ensure those responsible are held to account.
