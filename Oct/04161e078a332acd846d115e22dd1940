President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration is committed to ensuring water shortage in the entire Ukambani region ended for good, Water CS Simon Chelugui has said. Speaking on Saturday at Kinanie in Athi River, Machakos, Chelugui said the government so far has disbursed more than Sh22 billion for water and sanitation projects in Machakos, Kitui and Makueni counties. He said the water shortage will end by late 2022. In order to improve the water sector, the Ministry of Water appointed 65 directors, 18 of whom are from Ukambani region, he said. "That demonstrates the commitment of the President and government to see water coverage improves in Ukambani,” Chelugui said. He said the ministry has set aside Sh1.6 billion to expand connectivity and expansion of the sewerage system and water supply in fast-growing Machakos town. Sh600 million has been allocated to a water and sanitation project in Mwala subcounty, Chelugui said. Another Sh2.4 billion is for connecting Ithanga, Thika and Matuu areas in Kiambu and Machakos counties. Sh250 million has been allocated for a water project in Wote town, the Makueni county headquarters. Chelugui said construction of the Sh43 billion Thwake Dam in Makueni was 30 per cent complete. “In Kitui, the ministry is committed to reviving the UMADA project, which has been paralysed for 15 years. Its revival will complement other investments in Kitui to assure residents of adequate water supply and sewerage." The CS said a few individuals had stalled a Sh8.8 billion project in Yatta subcounty due to a land row. He said the issue was in court. He urged the Machakos county government and the region’s leadership to intervene to allow for completion of the project funded by the African Development Bank. "Everyone who was affected or displaced has been compensated adequately," Chelugui said. He called on Kenyans, especially those living along rivers Nairobi and Athi, to stop polluting them since the Thwake dam will rely on them. Edited by R.Wamochie
