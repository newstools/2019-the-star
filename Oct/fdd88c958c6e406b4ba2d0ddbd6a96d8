Ten-time African Cup of Club Champions Telkom are optimistic of winning back-to-back continental titles when the competition kicks goes down between December 1-10 in Ismailia, Egypt. The decorated hockey queens, who confirmed their participation ahead of today's deadline will be fighting for an 11th title despite the financial challenges bedeviling the club since the withdrawal of sponsorship by telecommunication company Telkom. In the 2018 edition held in Nigeria, Kenya reclaimed the trophy by beating Ghana Revenue Authority 2-0 at the Abuja National Stadium having lost to the same opposition 1-0  previously. The 21- time Kenyan champions look set to retain the league title before traveling for the continental assignment and coach Jos Openda said no matter what the club is going through at the moment, their sole aim will be to guard their continental reputation. He said:"Our main aim will be to retain the silverware. We won it back last year from Ghana who were victorious in 2017. It is a herculean task but it's manageable considering what we are going through. We pray that all goes well." "We are not used to hustling, we are used to moving smoothly. Now that we don't have a sponsor, things are not the same. Without finances our training is disrupted because it's about who has money and at what time. Players come for training only when they have cash." Openda remains confident that the situation will be resolved as soon as possible having contacted corporates. "We are waiting for replies from  Safaricom, Corporative bank and all other corporates we have written to come in handy and rescue the club." Telkom are the only side to confirm their participation so far.  Men side police, had withdrawn citing logistical challenges.
