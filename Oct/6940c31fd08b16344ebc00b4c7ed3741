The government has increased patrols in Kijabe Mission Centre and environs following the emergence of a criminal gang. Lari deputy county commissioner Aaron Koros said no case has been reported for the past two months, adding that they were still pursuing the criminals. They had been terrorising residents and motorists. Koros warned that police patrols will not be withdrawn until all members of the gang are brought to book. It is reported that the gang of four men used to waylay people and motorists on the road that links the centre to the Maai Mahiu-Nairobi highway. Victims were attacked and robbed of cash and other valuables, most of the attacks staged at the section popularly known as 'Monkey Corner'. Josphat Njoroge said the gang has its hideout on top of a hill from where they can monitor the movement of people and the police. "Whenever innocent people attempted to cut across the road to Kijabe from the highway, they attacked and robbed them," he said. Kijabe Mission Centre accommodates AIC Kijabe Hospital, Kijabe Boys High School, Kijabe Girls, The Rift Valley Academy and Moffat School of Bible, among other AIC institutions. Koros said he and subcounty police commander Ellen Wanjiku have changed tack. He said they will not back off until the criminals surrender or are arrested. He also warned carjackers that their days are numbered. Public service vehicles are targeted since many cases are happening at night when a passenger is alighting and a gang hijacks passengers and diverts them to rural areas, he said. "The strategy that we have embarked on cannot be discussed, but I'm assuring you we shall arrest people who will face the force of the law" he warned.
