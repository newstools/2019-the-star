Catholic bishops made a declaration aimed at the fight against corruption. They took off their shoes and made prayers uniting all who attended to say no to corruption. The bishops said the electronic transfer of donation would leave ‘a clear trail of donors’ for accountability’s sake. People willing to donate more than Sh50,000 would be required to write a letter providing all their details. The men of the robe also banned politicking in the pulpits, announced a six-month renewal of baptismal promises for every Catholic faithful to re-commit themselves against the evil of corruption. This move should be emulated by other religious organisations to bring the country closer to winning the war against corruption. It takes collective efforts.  Mombasa
