A man was electrocuted on Monday while vandalising Kenya Power cables along Mombasa Road in Athi River, Machakos county. The victim, who was not immediately identified, met his end at 9.30am after he attempted to steal the high-voltage power cables, which were still under installation. Authorities suspect he was part of a five-member gang that has been stealing cables. His accomplices escaped unhurt. Barely a month ago, cables worth more than Sh10 million were lost in a similar incident in the same subcounty. Subcounty police commander Samwel Mukuusi termed the incident unfortunate. He said police had launched investigations and would pursue to those on the run. The body was retrieved from a trench where the new cables were being installed. It was taken to Machakos Level 5 Hospital mortuary. Kenya power regional coordinator Cyrus Njenga condemned the theft, saying the firm has lost millions to vandalism. He warned residents against theft and said the police will not condone crime. “These cables were installed yesterday but within less than 24 hours, a team had come to vandalise them,” he told the press in Athi River hours after the tragedy. "They had axes, wire cutters, among other tools but the cables were energized and they didn’t know." (Edited by F'Orieny)
