Two-time world marathon champion Abel Kirui is fully behind Eliud Kipchoge as he attempts to run sub 2hours in the marathon at the INEOS 1:59 Challenge this weekend in Vienna, Austria. Kirui, Kipchoge's training mate at Global Communications in Kaptagat, said Kipchoge is capable of breaking the barrier to go along his 'No Human is Limited' slogan. “He has the power and zeal to conquer the world. His training has been immense and I hope, as a person who has competed in marathon for many years, that he will conquer the Challenge,” said Kirui, the 2017 Chicago Marathon champion. Kipchoge, the world marathon record holder at 2:01.39 — set at the 2018 Berlin Marathon — will be attempting to run the slowest time in the history of the 42km distance. “I knew him years back and through his resilience, he will deliver,” added the 2012 Olympic Games marathon silver medalist. The two train together at Global Sports Communication in Kaptagat area of Uasin Gishu county and Kirui, the third man to win back to back world marathon titles in 2009 and 2011 said if the weather will favour him, he may run a lower time. “As a marathoner and training mate, I wish him the best of luck as he tries his best in one of the most challenging race in the world. Running is not easy but his dedication will offer good results,” added the 2008 Vienna marathon champion. The runner who started his running career at Samitui primary school will also be competing at the Singapore marathon in December. He said Kipchoge’s Challenge will inspire him to run well in Singapore, where he will be chasing a personal best. “I am preparing well for the race and I want to run better time. My training has been going on well and I want to leave a mark there,” added the 2007 Berlin marathon silver medalist.
