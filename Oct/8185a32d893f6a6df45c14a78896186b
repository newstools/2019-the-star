Two people died on the spot while several got injured following an accident involving a KDF bus at Ndudori on Friday evening. Nakuru North Sub County police commander, Joyce Mwarania, told the Star on phone that the dead are pedestrians who sell farm produce along Nakuru-Ndudori road. The bus, suspected to have developed brake failure, hit a Matatu at Ol,Kalou junction injuring several passengers. Mwarania said the number and their condition is yet to be established. "We shall do a follow up to establish their condition," she said. The injured were rushed to Nakuru Provincial General hospital while the deceased were taken to the mortuary at the same facility. Mwarania's statement contracted that of Nahashon Mwangi, an eye witness who said four people died. He said the bus, which was headed to Nakuru from Gwa Kiongo, hit a pedestrian near Mteja Supermarket at Ndudori before hitting the matatu where three people died. "I was among those who pulled the victims from the ill fated matatu crash and rushed them to a private hospital here in Ndudori before they were rushed to Nakuru in an ambulance," he said. He said the KDF officers immediately cordoned off the scene.
