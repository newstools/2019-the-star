Comedian Eddie Butita has been going across the country to implement his project called ‘Eddie Butita Campus Tour’. “It started in January and its currently on the 17th campus. We are using entertainment as a medium to bring youths together and at the same time, communicate our four main agendas: Talent, entrepreneurship, responsibilities and mental health,” he told Word Is on Friday. “We create a platform where we merge top artistes with campus talent. We engage students in talks with the artistes too.” Is he planning to take it to TV? “We are hoping to go bigger because we have not fully implemented the plan so as time goes by more things will come into place.” The comedian is now doubling up as an artiste after releasing the song Kidesign featuring rapper King Kaka and comedian DJ Shiti. “That was just a trial that worked. It was a comedy thing that ended up being a serious song and I don’t mind doing another.” He says his secret is to always keep the fans wanting more. “Expect anything the rest of the year because I like keeping the audience glued for new ideas. I might do what I have done before or bring something new. “I have had so many best moments in different areas in my career and that’s something I appreciate.”
