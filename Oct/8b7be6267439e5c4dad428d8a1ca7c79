The Supreme Court has dismissed the National Assembly objections on Division of Revenue Bill. The apex court cited a lack of jurisdiction to hear and determine the case. The court ruled that the advisory petition filed by the 47 governors on the division of revenue bill is of great public importance and deserves to be heard. A five-judge bench of the apex court led by Chief Justice David Maraga said even though some matters pertaining to the bill are pending before the high court, they will proceed to hear it on selected issues. The case will be mentioned on October 16. Governors had moved to court accusing the National Treasury and the National Assembly of holding counties hostage. The county chiefs said the National Treasury has continuously been ignoring the Commission of Revenue Allocation's recommendations on the sharing of revenue between the national government and the developed units. In it's application the National Assembly had argued that the Supreme Court lacks the jurisdiction to issue an advisory opinion on the matter. The Council of Governors has also called upon the National Treasury to halt county's Ifmis budget uploads until the passage of the controversial Division of Revenue Bill is passed. CJ Maraga had initially advised both parties to negotiate andÂ agree on the amount of money to be disbursed to county governments. The mediation team flopped as National Assembly and Senate did not reach a compromise on their Sh316.5 billion and Sh335 billion allocations respectively.
