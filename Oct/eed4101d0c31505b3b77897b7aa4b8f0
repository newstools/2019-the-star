The 47 woman representatives plan to meet Education CS George Magoha next week over the programme to distribute sanitary towels to schools countrywide. Vihiga Woman Representative Beatrice Adagala said in Mbale town yesterday that the programme had ensured girls from poor families remain in class during their menstruation cycle. Magoha said a week ago that the money allocated to the ministry was insufficient to run the programme. “We are going to meet the CS to discuss this and see the way forward so that we do not keep these girls at risk again,” Adagala said. She said that they will propose a supplementary budget of Sh500 million to support the programme. Adagala said that if the programme is suspended, more girls will get out of schools to source cash for pads, exposing them to danger. The MP said this will result in more teen pregnancies and the spread of sexually transmitted infections among other problems to girls. “Some girls are contracting diseases because of what they are using to manage their menstrual flow. Some use cow dung, other uses sand, and the rest use old dirty blankets, shirts and matres,” she added.
