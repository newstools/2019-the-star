A Nakuru court will issue a ruling a next week on whether four Bomet county executives recently rejected by MCAs will continue earning salaries pending determination of their case. Gender CEC Bernard Ng'eno and Justus Maina (Administration, ICT and Public Service), Philip Sowek (Roads) and Benson Sang (Water) moved to court challenging the manner in which they were removed from office. The four are part of nine who served under the late Governor Joyce Laboso but were voted out by the assembly. During a hearing last Friday, Governor Hillary Barchok through his lawyer Kipkoech Ngetich said the demands by the former CECs were “almost impossible to implement”. In a ruling issued on August 28 by judge Bryan Ongaya, the governor was restrained from removing them from office or interfering with their contracts of employment. The ruling meant the former CECs would continue drawing salaries from the county and enjoying all other benefits. Barchok is, however, challenging the decision saying the petitioners were no longer employees of the county as they ceased holding office upon the death of the Governor Laboso. “It is my belief that the petitioners have through a calculated and deliberate non-disclosure of material facts attempted to create an impression that they are employees of Bomet serving as county executive members but have been unlawfully removed by the county assembly,” read the sworn affidavit by Barchok.
