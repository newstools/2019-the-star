Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot has said Punguza Mizigo Initiative will continue to be presented before county assemblies despite rejection by 12 counties so far. Aukot on Wednesday urged Kenyans to join the movement and drum up support for the Bill, adding that the party will soon be announcing the next move. "We shall be announcing our next steps very soon. This is like a football tournament. It does not end with one match. The game has just started," Aukot said. Nakuru, Machakos and Nairobi counties debated and rejected the bill on Tuesday. Uasin Gishu county still stands as the only county that has passed the bill so far. Aukot accused politicians, whom he described as 'predators', of bribing MCAs to vote against the bill. "Its rejection is choreographed and is financed by the same political class that has been benefiting from the sweat and blood of the ordinary citizen," Aukot said. More than 80 city Nairobi county MCAs voted against the bill on Tuesday, saying that it lacked representation. Deputy Minority Whip Moses Ogeto said the bill undermines the minority tribes in the country. “The bill only speaks for the take it all, but forgets the minority in this country,” he said. Aukot said amending articles 73, 79, 157 and 229 of the Constitution will end impunity as well as ending the culture of stealing public resources. Other counties that have rejected Aukot's Bill include Kirinyaga, Kiambu, Nyeri, Kisii, Nyamira, Narok, West Pokot, Murang'a and Siaya.
