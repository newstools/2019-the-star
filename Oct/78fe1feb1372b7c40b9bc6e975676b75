Nominated Senator Farhiya Ali Haji has proposed a new law to guide  lifestyle audits. The Lifestyle Audit Bill 2019 seeks to amend the Public Officers Ethics Act to make the declaration of income, assets and liabilities open to public scrutiny. It proposes all State officers undergo lifestyle audits. A lifestyle audit is simply a study of a person’s living standards to see if they are consistent with their reported income. Two years ago, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a lifestyle audit of himself, his deputy and all government officials. It is not clear what became of the audit but some leaders question the framework. Lifestyle audits are anchored in our Constitution. Chapter 6 on integrity and leadership and Article 10 provide for integrity, transparency and accountability together with Article 35, which provides for the freedom of information. They are the Leadership and Integrity Act 2012; the Public Officer and Ethics Act, 2003; and Public Service Act, 2015 are specific pieces of the law that breathe life into Chapter 6. Haji’s proposal should be supported because among other things it will give impetus to the fight against graft by identifying pointers to improper activity that has enabled the person to live beyond their means.
