A high court in Uganda has sentenced a convicted man to 14 years for the murder of Mowzey Radio, one of East Africa's most popular musicians, following a bar brawl last year,Â Daily Monitor newspaper reports. Godfrey Wamala, also known as Troy, was found guilty of manslaughter on Monday. Mowzey Radio, whose real name was Moses Ssekibogo, died on 1 February 2018 just hours after Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni donated $8,300 (Sh830,000) towards his medical bills. The Afrobeats star was in hospital for 10 days receiving treatment for head injuries that he had sustained in the brawl. Justice Jane Abodo of Entebbe High Court said Wamala did not intentionally kill the celebrity musician despite the brawl, the Monitor reports. She said that Wamala has the right to appeal.
