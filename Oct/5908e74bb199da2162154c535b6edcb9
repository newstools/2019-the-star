A man appeared before Nyahururu resident magistrate Cynthia Muhoro for operating a wines and spirits shop without an alcohol permit. Bernard Kimathi pleaded guilty to the charge of running Glory Wines and Spirits within Nyahururu town without a license. “I am a university student at Methodist University and I was only doing this job to raise my tuition fees,”  Kimathi. He was released on a fine of Sh 10, 000. The court heard that the owner of the premises, Eunice Rawara, had gone underground and switched off her phone after getting wind of the incident. In the same court, Alice Njeri Mwangi was arraigned for operating an alcohol joint before opening hours. Njeri, a resident of Maina village in the outskirts of Nyahururu town, allegedly opened her Generation Bar at 6am on October 23. She denied the charge. The prosecution presented before court a crate of Diamond Ice beer which she was allegedly selling at the time of her arrest. Njeri told the court she had gone to clean her premises when police officers stormed in and ordered her to carry the crate and proceed with them to Nyahururu police station. The case will be mentioned on October 30. Police officers in Nyahururu have been carrying out raids on unscrupulous alcohol traders who operate without licenses or open during unauthorised hours.
