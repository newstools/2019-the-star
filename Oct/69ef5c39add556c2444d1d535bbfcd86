ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi was on Saturday pelted stones by Kibra residents at Kamkunji grounds as he campaigned for his candidate Eliud Owalo. As Mudavadi addressed the crowd, a group of youth emerged and started hurling stones at him. The rowdy youth also threw bottles at his vehicle. Mudavadi and his team hurriedly left the venue with his supporters in hot pursuit. Police lobbed tear gas canisters and fired live rounds to disperse the youth. Other leaders present were Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi and ANC candidate Eliud Owalo.
