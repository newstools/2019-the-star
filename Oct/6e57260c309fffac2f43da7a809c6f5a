Putting too much pressure on children to perform well in school could lead some to suicide, Embu Woman Representative Jane Wanjuki has said. Wanjuki said some parents pressure their children to take certain courses in college or university instead of letting  them decide what they want. The MP said children have varying abilities and may not perform as their parents might wish. She said being rough on children can make them feel frustrated, unloved and lose hope in life. That could be the reason some pupils have been reported to commit suicide. “Children are gifted in various ways with some being talented in other fields other  than academics. Parents should try to understand their children's talents and help them pursue them,” Wanjuki said. She spoke in her office when she distributed Sh6 million bursaries from the National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF) to students across the county. Wanjuki urged parents to enroll their children in technical and vocational colleges to take advantage of the bursaries the government is giving students. She said there is scarcity of skilled manpower in technical fields.
