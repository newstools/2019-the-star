This year, Mashujaa Day will be marked at Mama Ngina Waterfront in Mombasa. Buildings, ferry vessels and all other visible vessels on our sea and all kinds of structures should be spruced up with a new coat of paint. Mombasa has been honoured to host this year’s Mashujaa Day celebrations in the spirit of devolution. It is the first time the county is hosting such a magnificent event. Residents should be appreciative, jovial and happy to host this year’s occasion. It is a rare occurrence, it could take over 46 years to happen in Mombasa if all counties host it. Heaps of garbage are still evident in many streets just days to the big festival. The ferry vessels crossing the Likoni channel are still an eyesore with rusty structures. They should be repainted and repaired to make them presentable.  Mombasa
