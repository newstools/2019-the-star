Kenyan model-cum-singer Tanasha Donna has gone back to the studio a week after she gave birth. The former radio presenter is working on her new project, "Donna Tella EP". She took to Instagram to share a video of herself in studio. "Mummy duties but we still grinding," she wrote. Donna has already released two hit songs, 'Radio', featuring Barak Jacuzzi, and the single 'Nah Easy'. In this EP, she is rumoured to have featured WCB singer Mbosso and a couple of Kenyan artistes. Last year, she was introduced by Diamond Platnumz as her girlfriend, and the two recently welcomed a baby boy.
