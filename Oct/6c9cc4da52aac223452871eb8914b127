Fresh from releasing their debut album, 'Made In The Streets', H_art the Band spent the weekend in Thika on their countrywide tour to promote the album. Revellers at Ananas Mall were treated to live music as the band performed their 13 tracks from the album, fusing them with their old hits such as 'Uliza Kiatu', 'Ukimwona' and 'Masheesha'. The name of the album was inspired by the memory of how they met when the three were trying to forge a path in the arts industry. Also performing were Mugithi maestro Samido, Nviiri the Storyteller and Ben Soul.
