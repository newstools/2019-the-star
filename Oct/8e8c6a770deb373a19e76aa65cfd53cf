Residents living in the lowlands of Embu county have been urged to move to safer grounds to avert cases of landslides and being swept by floods. This follows continued heavy rainfall experienced in different parts of the country. Addressing the press on Wednesday, Public Service executive David Kariuki said those living in the lowlands are at risk of being swept away by flash floods. "Due to the heavy downpour and storms being experienced, we urge residents to be cautious in their movement to avert loss of lives and property," he said. Kariuki called upon those living near and along river banks to move to higher grounds. The weatherman has predicted that the rains may continue for the next few weeks. Kariuki said further that the county government is engaging relevant partners to provide assistance to those vulnerable. Last week, a mother and her son were killed by floods at Kabuguri in Mbeere South. The body of the boy was recovered while efforts to search the woman's are still ongoing. "We acknowledge that rains and strong winds are being experienced across the county, we are doing all we can to manage any cases of disaster," the CEC said. A disaster management expert advised residents to avoid sheltering from the rains under trees as this puts one in the risk of being struck by lightning. Residents have also been urged to report any cases of floods, landslides and other dangers caused by prolonged rains to any administration offices. Edited by R.Wamochie
