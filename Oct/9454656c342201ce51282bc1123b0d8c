Police officers in Machakos have released five colleagues arrested earlier in the town on suspicion they were criminals. They had been arrested under unclear circumstances near an ATM belonging to KCB at about 11pm on Tuesday. Many reports have emerged recently about police colluding with criminals or committing crimes themselves. Arrested were police officers Richard Wambua, Boniface Wambua, Cyprian Odundo, and warders Julius Mwalili and Musyoki Mutua. A detective confided to the Star that after in-depth investigations, they found nothing linking the officers to any criminal activity. Hence, they were released. “There is nothing to press any charges on the officers. Therefore, we treat the claims [of wrongdoing] as mere speculation," the source told Star on phone. County police commander John Muiruri said investigations had revealed that the officers were not criminals. He said they had been carrying out their constitutional mandates at the time of the arrests. He addressed the press in Machakos on Thursday. The police boss noted that the five were released immediately and given their money back. However, the police boss urged residents who may have been robbed to report to the station's OCS. The police were seized from a private car a few metres from the ATM. The Toyota Noah driven by Mwalili was impounded. "The arrested officers were found outside a KCB ATM in unclear circumstances. Upon conducting a search, Sh100,000 was recovered from the vehicle’s dashboard and another Sh168,600 from Mwalili," the officer said. The money had been hidden inside the cop’s socks, he said, the officer failed to account for it. The detectives also recovered a Prisons department beret. Edited by R.Wamochie
