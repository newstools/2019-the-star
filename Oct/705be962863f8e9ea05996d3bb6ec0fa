What happened to plans to construct a wall to separate external aggression from Somalia-based al Shabaab militia? Kenya is constantly under attack by terror cells from Somalia. An idea was hatched to build a highrise wall and a three-metre deep trench next to the wall, to keep away terror militia at bay, but the idea seems to have quietly been abandoned and instead, a mesh wire fence erected. It is barely talked about anymore. This wall was what could have been the country’s long-term solution to the problem of constant attacks from the terror group, especially around the border. Perhaps the money to construct was wired or siphoned into individuals’ pocket. This has become the story in Kenya, everybody for himself or herself.  Mombasa
