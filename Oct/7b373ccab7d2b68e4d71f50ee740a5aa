A group of Jubilee Party youths has thrown its weight behind ODM candidate Imran Okoth in the Kibra by-election. The youth said they snubbed Jubilee candidate McDonald Mariga in the spirit of the handshake. “We will mobilise our people and fellow Jubilee party members to support, vote and protect the votes of ODM’s Imran Okoth. Kibra is safe in his hands and the handshake will remain strong,” said Zack Kinuthia. Kinuthia said that the group will support President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga in spreading the spirit of the handshake in Kibra and across the country. Uhuru and Raila shook hands on March 9 to end animosity that preceded the 2017 general elections. Receiving the youth yesterday were Nairobi county assembly minority leader Elias Otieno and former Kisumu deputy governor Ruth Odinga. Otieno thanked the youth for supporting the ODM candidate and the handshake. “Kibra is an ODM zone. We, however, want to appreciate the fact that our opponents wanted to participate in the race, which would not have been interesting without their presence,” he said. Odinga thanked the youths for taking a courageous step to support Imran. “It is encouraging to see youths who are firm. The handshake brought peace and what they have done will only strengthen it,” she said. “We will go door to door. Church to church in an assault never witnessed before,” Kinuthia said. The youths said that the President had not endorsed Mariga for the seat. “He was ambushed and he never said anything apart from taking a picture with the candidate," Kinuthia said.
