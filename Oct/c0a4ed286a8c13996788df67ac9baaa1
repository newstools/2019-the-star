The police who were within assembly were forced to throw tear gas to disperse the commotion which was in the office. No MCAs was spared as even Elachi and the majority leader sort for water to cool their eyes. According to the MCAs who were supporting Elachi, the goons were sent by the Jubilee side of MCAs. But the Jubilee MCAs claimed that the goons were brought by ODM side. According to an MCA who sort anonymity, the ODM MCAs had planned Elachi's return, without involving the House leadership. Elachi was last seen in the office last year in September when the MCAs attempted to forcefully remove her from the office.
