Shock and grief engulfed Kimugul village in Sotik on Friday after a 13-year-old girl hanged herself. The body of the KCPE candidate at Gateway Academy was found dangling from a tree outside their home at around 5pm after a short argument with her mother. Sotik subcounty police commander Francis Nganga confirmed the incident, saying she used a sisal rope to kill herself. It is unclear what the two quarreled about but some neighbors interviewed but requested not to be named said they had bitter exchanges and such might have offended the girl. “We do not know the cause of the death but the dispute may have offended the girl driving her into taking her life,” a neighbour said. Nganga said they will interrogate her parents to establish what might have caused her to commit suicide. The body was moved to Kapkatet Hospital morgue as investigations continue. The incident comes in the wake of a rising of suicide among teenagers from the county with close to 10 cases having been reported in the last two months. Nominated Senator Alice Milgo has called on parents to be close to their children and guide them. She further urged single parents to strive to educate their children saying poverty could be one of the causes of these deaths.
