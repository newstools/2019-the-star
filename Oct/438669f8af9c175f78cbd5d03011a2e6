The Ministry of Health is training Homa Bay fishers on control and prevention of HIV/Aids along Lake Victoria beaches. Statistics indicate that the rate of HIV spread in Homa Bay is at 23 per cent. Through the National Aids Control Council, the ministry on Thursday said the initiative will reduce the spread of the disease in the county. NACC regional coordinator Steve Amollo said the exercise will ensure fishermen and their families are imparted with knowledge on how the prevent the transmission of the virus. “The spread of the virus is a burden not only to Homa Bay county but the national government,” Amollo said. Addressing journalists on the sidelines of a meeting with some beach officials in Homa Bay town, Amollo said they want to eliminate practices that promote the spread of HIV within the fishing community. He singled out practices like Jaboya (sex for fish), puk iyier (use and dump) and sexual relationships with multiple partners without using protection. We’re training beach leaders and giving them free condoms and test kits as a way of reducing the spread, Amollo said. Homa Bay county Aids and STI control coordinator Iscar Amoth said sex for fish has become rampant among the fisher folks. She said the activities have been major contributors to the fast spread of HIV. “There have been campaigns for people to have one sexual partner which is not the case for those living along the lake. We want the trend to stop,” she said. Amoth said the beach officials will sensitise fishermen to get tested. “Fishermen have been shying from getting tested for HIV but their leaders can easily talk to them." Edited by R.Wamochie
