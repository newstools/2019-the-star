Wildfires are becoming a major threat on the economy of Kenya not to mention the recent Aberdares Forest fire that started a week ago. A country may incur great loses as a result of wildfires which may distract tourism sites and archaeological features often protected by soil which when left bare, is likely to be eroded. Forest fires also expose the country to the risk of drought since most of our forests are water catchment areas. Let us save our forests to avert problems. People who have encroached on forest lands should be evicted to protect the forests.  Mombasa
