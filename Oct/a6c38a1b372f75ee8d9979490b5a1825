Seduce a woman without disrespecting them, President Uhuru Kenyatta has advised men. Uhuru spoke when he officially commissioned the Nairobi expressway on Wednesday. The project was launched near Cabanas on Mombasa Road. A first of its kind, the project will be a four lane dual carriageway. Uhuru made the seduction comment in jest on Wednesday in what appeared to be a reaction to the fracas that took place at City Hall when speaker Beatrice Elachi made a come back in the Assembly. "Wazee waheshimu akina mama.. sio kuenda na kukosea mwanamke heshima...wewe enda umtongoze pole pole.. ukibahatika sawa..ukikosa tafuta mwingine. This loosely translates to, "Men respect women, don't go disrespecting them. Go and seduce them slowly, if you succeed, well and good, if not look for another one. Amid laughter from the crowd, Uhuru said seducing with respect brings people together without fights. "Na hiyo ndio njia ya kumaliza ukabila lakini si kukosea mtu heshima..tunagombania nini..kushindana ni sawa lakini kuishi ni pamoja.." he said. This translates to, "That is the only way to eradicate tribalism but not to disrespect others. Why are we fighting? Competition is a must but we have to stay together." The assembly last Wednesday turned into a battlefield with chaos and tear gas at City Hall for three hours after Elachi made her way back into the assembly. Property was damaged, phone accessories were stolen as rival 'goons' made their way into the assembly and clashed. The MCAs were also divided with those on Elachiâ€™s side and others against her return, led by Majority Leader Abdi Guyo and acting speaker Chege Mwaura.
