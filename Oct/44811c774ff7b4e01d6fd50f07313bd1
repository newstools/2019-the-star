A Kenyan woman married to a Swiss investor who took over his multimillion property in Watamu after an eight-year legal battle is now entangled in another court fight with her former lawyer. Joyce Jepleting Reinhard, wife of Daniel Bernhard Reinhard, is sued by lawyer Katwa Kigen who handled the property dispute case of Mawimbi lodges, swahili houses and land properties. Kigen who no longer represents Jepleting is demanding Sh79.5 million. But Jepleting says sheÂ paid the lawyer the agreed amount and has an agreement to prove it. The late Daniel Hefti was the original owner of the investments comprising a tourist hotel and Swahili houses. Other owners of the properties are Daniel Bernhard Reinhard and her mother Elizabeth Hefti Reinhard. Through her lawyer Jackline Chepkwony, Jepleting has filed an application at a court in Malindi seeking orders to strike out the costs, saying she had receipts and agreement of Sh3.2 million paid to Kigen. In the application before Malindi Lands and Environment judge James Olola, Jepleting attaches documents she says prove Kigen was paid in full. The documents show fees payment to Katwa & Kemboy Advocates amounting to Sh553,500 via M-Pesa between July 7, and 26, 2017. Jepleting also paid the lawyer through bank transfer Sh2,150,000 between July 19, 2016 and April 25, 2017. She says she paid Sh500,000 in cash, which was acknowledged by the lawyer. Justice Olola ordered the matter to come for highlighting of submissions on November 20. He gave Kigen seven days to file a response.
