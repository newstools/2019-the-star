World record holder Eliud Kipchoge is back in Eldoret, Kenya, after a good run in Vienna beating the two hour barrier. Kipchoge became the first human to run 42 kilometers in under two hours in the Ineos challenge. He crossed the finish line on Saturday in a time of 1:59:40. Kenya Airways took to Twitter on Wednesday to express its pride in flying the marathoner to home. Kipchoge received a flurry of congratulatory messages from across the world after the Ineos challenge. He inspired many with the slogan, 'No human is limited'. Eliud was flown to Vienna, Austria, aboard a private jet owned by Sir Jim’s Gulfstream G280, who is the founder of Ineos. He was flown by two pilots from Eldoret International Airport. Eliud has been nominated for the 2019 IAAF Athlete of the Year, whose awards gala will be held next month. Eliud headlines a list of 11 athletes, most of whom capped a stellar season with impressive performances at the 2019 World Championships in Doha, Qatar.
