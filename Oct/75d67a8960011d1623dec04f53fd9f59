Farmers in North Rift have been urged to engage experts in the management of their produce as the harvesting season begins. Job Oyoo from Export Trading Group, an agricultural multinational, explained that through improved storage techniques, farm produce would be of better quality and last longer. He noted that  proper handling and storage of farm produce would reduce the risk of aflatoxin contamination. Oyoo  said about 35 per cent of farm produce goes to waste as a result of poor handling after harvesting. “There are also huge losses occasioned by inappropriate storage facilities,” he observed on Saturday during a farmers’ field day in Narok. The losses in turn worsen the already poor state of food security in the country. Oyoo said there was a need for increased awareness on the importance of proper storage techniques through market days and training sessions with farmers. Making storage facilities accessible to farmers would reduce losses and guard them against exploitation. “It will therefore enhance beneficiaries' incomes by allowing them to market their production surplus at opportune times in order to gain higher profits,” he told the farmers. ETG country director Lewis Giles said the firm had launched an awareness campaign that would see farmers invest in modern storage facilities. “We are also assisting them through our extension services arm with knowledge on the best ways to reduce loss of the produce during harvesting. We aim to roll out this programme countrywide by mid-next year,”  he said.
