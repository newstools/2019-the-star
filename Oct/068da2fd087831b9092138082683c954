Shabana's interim coach Vincent Nyaberi is hoping for a positive start when he takes charge of his first game against Vihiga United today at Gusii Stadium. “It is a very important game for me as a coach and for the team. Vihiga is so far unbeaten but we want to end their unbeaten record and also maintain our unbeaten run at home this season,” said Nyaberi. Nyaberi took over from Gilbert Selebwa who resigned on Monday. “Life must go on. I have spoken with the players and they are now focusing on the game against Vihiga,” Nyaberi added. He said he is keen to stay and replace Selebwa on a permanent basis and he has exuded confidence that he is up to the task. “Young coaches should be given a chance to express themselves. I have been in the game for 19 years and I think I have what it takes to guide Shabana back to the Premier League,” noted the former Shabana and Thika United defender. He added: “The gap between us and the top team in the league is nine points. My immediate target is to reduce it to three points because the top teams will definitely drop points.” Shabana chairman Jared Nivaton yesterday denied owing Selebwa any salary arrears. He said the club management is in the process of looking for a new coach.
