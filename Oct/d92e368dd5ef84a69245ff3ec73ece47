The famed Tusker Safari 7s rugby and party returned with fanfare after a hiatus from the scene for nearly a decade on Mashujaa Day weekend at RFUEA Grounds. The tournament went on for two days. Despite the rainy weather, Kenyans in their thousands attended the event. Besides celebrating Kenyan team Morans' victory over South Africa, fans were also treated to after-party concerts, where famed artistes performed their best tunes for the masses. The line-up included Nameless, Nyashinski, Jua Cali, Ethic, Khaligraph Jones, Sailors, Ochunglo Family, Boondocks and Kristoff.
