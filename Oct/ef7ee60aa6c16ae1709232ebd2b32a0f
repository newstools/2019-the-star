The eagerly awaited Kenya Swimming Federation (KSF) elections earlier scheduled for next month have been shelved due to various objections from FINA and stakeholders. The elections were earlier slated for October 26 and were to be preceded by the Annual General Meeting this weekend. The polls, according to insiders, will now be held on another date subject to the stakeholders' agreement. FINA have twice this year threatened to ban Kenya from all swimming activities worldwide if elections are not held by the end of the month. Sources said November or December look likely as the options for new dates for both the AGM and elections. In a statement from the Interim Management Committee (IMC), the world governing body, FINA Compliance Committee has raised objections with the proposed constitution. The statement from the Compliance Committee said: “ The Fina legal department requires some minor amendment to the contents of the Compliance form for clarity purposes. "Two other clauses require an amendment to comply with the FINA rules on voting rights of Bureau members attending the AGM of the federation. " IMC also need to insert and stipulate in the draft Constitution that no amendment of the Constitution or change of name of the federation can be effected without the prior written approval of FINA,” the statement added. Following the dissemination of the draft, the divergence of opinion appears to have arisen in regard to certain aspects of some clauses and structures contained in the draft-constitution which require further consultation both from within the swimming fraternity as well as with CANA and FINA. The IMC has stated its commitment to a transparent process in a bid to achieve the right foundation structures for the sport to be governed effectively and efficiently with financial discipline going forward. A new date for the polls will be announced in due course.
