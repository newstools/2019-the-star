After he recaptured his seat in Thursday's by-election, Abakaile MCA Mohamed Ali now has his eyes set on the minority leadership he lost with the seat. Ali’s 2017 win was nullified in March after runner-up Abdiwahab Sheikh successfully challenged it in court, citing irregularities. Sheikh decamped to Jubilee party for the by-elections held on Thursday but still lost to ODM's Ali. He garnered 1,806 votes to the winner's 1,961. Sources told the  Star that immediately his win was quashed, Ali entered into an informal arrangement with Dadaab MCA Mohamed Abdi to hold brief for him. Abdi did not respond to calls or text messages asking for his comment on the matter. According to the agreement, Abdi would relinquish the seat in the event Ali retained his seat. Both come from the Aulihan clan. “It was a temporary strategy. An informal arrangement that was formalised by the assembly,” an MCA who was privy to the matter said. But on Sunday when asked whether he will have his minority leader position back, Ali was not committal only saying that “we will cross that bridge when we get there”. “For now I want to sincerely thank the electorate who in their own wisdom showed faith in my leadership. This victory belongs to them,” Ali said. It has been a tough journey bearing in mind that the by election come after another grueling campaign in the general election, he said. “I will quickly embark on my duties of legislative, representation and oversight which I promise to do to my best of my ability. My promise to the people of Abakaile ward from the beginning is still there and has always been there regardless of what we were made to go through,” he added. (edited by O. Owino)
