A strong team of 10 athletes have been selected to represent Kenya at the Africa Universities Cross Country champions to be staged in Marrakech, Morocco on November 9. Athletics Kenya Universities secretary-general Edward Muema said Kenya is keen to reclaim the title they last won in 2013 at Entebbe Golf Course in Uganda. “We selected a very strong team of five men and five women to represent us in Moroccos. We have excelled in past editions. We also expect them to represent us in the World Universities Cross Country Championships to be held at the same venue in March next year,” said Muema. He said that the team failed to participate at the last edition in Algeria and World Universities Cross Country Championships in St Gallen in Switzerland due to a visa hitch. “I'm happy we are making a comeback and our team of 10 will reclaim the title. Kenya is a powerhouse in athletics and we want to maintain that. We have already sent our appeal to the government for sponsorship to enable us participate in the two events,” added Muema. According to Muema, the men's team will be led by Lingokal Benson of Kibabii University, who won the men's 10km event during the Kenya Universities Cross Country Championships held at Egerton University. Others in the team are Geoffrey Chirchir (Egerton), Bernard Koech (Mt Kenya), Desmond Kimunyan (Laikipia) and Johnson Kaberia (Mt Kenya). The women's team will have the talented Sharon Chebet of Kabianga, Diana Wanza of Kenyatta University, Peris Cheptoo of Laikipia, Mary Wairimu of Mt Kenya and Sharon Kemboi of University of Eldoret. He said a technical team of five members will be named to take the team to Morocco.
