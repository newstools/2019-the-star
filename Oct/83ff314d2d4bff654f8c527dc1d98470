A Facebook post claiming that President Uhuru Kenyatta has reappointed former Head of Civil Service Francis Muthaura as the chairman of the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) for a period of 3 years is TRUE. The appointment was announced in Gazette Notice 9341 dated October 2, 2019, and will run for 3 years with effect from October 21, 2019. Muthaura was first appointed to chair the Kenya Revenue Authority on May 23, 2018 following the revocation of Dr. Edward Sambili’s appointment to the same post. Muthaura’s first appointment to this position had been challenged by activist Okiya Omtata, who alleged that the notice had been made without the president’s signature and seal, which would have made it invalid. However, the court ruled in favour of Muthaura’s appointment, having found no breach of the law as purported in Omtata’s petition. Muthaura’s appointment as KRA chairperson is set to run until October 20, 2022.
