Theatre and screen actor Nick Denda is about to showcase his new project, "Man Moments", at the Alliance Francaise. Talking to Word Is on Friday, he said, "It is a play I wrote and directed. It was an idea from Mbeki Mwalimu we had a play a few months ago, and there was this segment called 'Man Moments' that I wrote for another play and the audience loved it. "They told me, if we made an entire play from that segment, they would want to come through, the person doing that role was Ian Mbugua." The show starts on Thursday and runs until Sunday. Denda, who doubles up as a radio presenter, spent three months writing and a month rehearsing. "What's cool about it is that it's a satirical play about how men view relationships, women, money and society. It's about all those things in the view of a man."
