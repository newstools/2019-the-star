Kihara, CBS and Secretary, Legislative Affairs and Regulatory Compliance, Jasper Mbiuki, "read the tweet. The Commission will thereafter undertake a supporters verification exercise to ascertain that they are registered voters from the County. Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja and MPs from the county in July said the future of the devolved unit lied with President Uhuru Kenyatta. Samboja explained that mediation efforts to bring the executive and assembly to an understanding had not yielded fruit, even with the intervention of various stakeholders. “We now have more than 40,000 signatures and preparing to petition President Kenyatta to dissolve the county because dialogue has hit a dead end,” he said. Taita Taveta has 180,000 registered voters and Samboja needs only 18,000 signatures to petition the President to dissolve the county. “After presenting the petition, we will not comment. We will leave it to the President and he will use his wisdom to make a decision,"he said. Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja last week on Thursday survived an impeachment attempt by MCAs. The Senate committee that probed his proposed sacking by the county assembly of Taita Taveta  dismissed the grounds advanced by the MCAs.
