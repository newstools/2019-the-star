The Kisii county government has disbursed Sh52 million as conditional grant to 50 vocational training centres to cater for tuition fees. Governor James Ongwae said the support will help students to acquire relevant skills to earn a living in future. Ongwae said vocational training institutions play a key role in training the youths who failed to meet grades to join universities and colleges. “Those with technical skills have been getting good returns from their expertise,” Ongwae said. He spoke during the Mashujaa Day celebrations at Gusii Stadium on Sunday. The governor also said that 160,000 learners in various secondary schools have benefited from the County Bursary Fund. This financial year, the county boss said, 39,000 students are going to benefit from Sh135 million. He urged institutions that receive the funds to utilise them to improve academic standards. The county chief urged parents to support their children in ensuring that they achieve their dreams. Meanwhile, Ongwae said his administration will next week beign a compulsory removal of eucalyptus trees from water catchment areas across the county. “Environmental conservation is critical for sustainable socio-economic development. We have intensified conservation activities throughout the county,” Ongwae said. He said that experts have warned that the county will become water-scarce if residents don’t stop the cultivation of eucalyptus trees on water catchment areas. Some locals have defied the executive order he issued three months ago directing them to cut the trees from riparian areas, he said. “I'm telling owners who have since defied the order that my administration is going to use its own machinery to fell the trees,” Ongwae said. Also resent at the celebrations were his deputy Joash Maangi, First Lady Elizabeth Ongwae, speaker David Kombo, a number of MCAs among others. (edited by O. Owino)
