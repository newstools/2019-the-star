President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday launched a Sh62.1 billion expressway project in Nairobi. Uhuru said the project is intended to ease traffic along Mombasa Road to save commuters time. Speaking during the launch on Mombasa Road in Embakasi constituency, the President the project will be implemented under public-private partnership as a toll road. “The project road is located in Machakos and Nairobi counties. It starts at Mlolongo and ends at James Gichuru junction, a total length of 27km,” Uhuru said. It will be undertaken by China Road and Bridge Corporation as the concessionaire. “The concession period is 30 years including three years of construction. This will be optimized so that the project is commissioned ahead of time by December 2021,” Uhuru said. According to its scope of works, the expressway consists of a four-lane ground level highway from Mlolongo to the Eastern Bypass interchange (10km), a six-lane ground level highway from the Eastern Bypass interchange to the Southern Bypass interchange (5km) and  a four-lane elevated highway from the Southern Bypass near Capital Centre through the City Centre along Uhuru Highway up to James Gichuru  Junction (11.2 km). The expressway will have 10 exit and entry roads and 10 toll plazas. Kenya National Highways Authority, the project’s contracting authority, said the government has enough land for the project. “We are here to launch this road. It will be constructed from Mlolongo town through James Gichuru Road to Kawangware. The project will create jobs for the youth,” Uhuru said.
