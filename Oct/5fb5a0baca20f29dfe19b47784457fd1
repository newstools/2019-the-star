Residents of the upper eastern region have been urged to take advantage of the recently established One Stop Border Point in Moyale to boost trade between Kenya and Ethiopia. Acting Treasury CS Ukur Yatani said the facility, among other six in the country, was being underutilized. “We should see more trade volumes passing through the OSBP at Moyale- an indication of robust business activity between Kenya and Ethiopia. Unfortunately, we are not witnessing this,” he said. He said there is potential for additional revenue collection from the region hence adding that the state was looking to establish more OSBPs along the common border with Ethiopia to facilitate trade. Yatani said that the government was keen on working towards full implementation of an agreement on free trade earlier agreed between the two countries. The OSBPs are aimed at alleviating movement across borders by improving speed and efficiency hence reducing barriers to trade and improving business competitiveness. At the OSBPs, KRA has put in place measures such as installation of scanners and intelligence aided verification of cargo to address mis-declarations, concealments, and substandard cargo. “Movement of goods across the borders in undesignated crossing points amounts to smuggling,” KRA commissioner of customs and border control Kevin Safari said.
