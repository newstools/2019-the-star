The government has said that the operation to recover the body of Mariam Kighenda, 35, and her four-year-old daughter Amanda has entered a critical phase. Kenya Ferry Services managing director Bakari Gowa on Monday evening said the government is optimistic as the operation enters day eight since the accident was reported. Gowa said the operation has been boosted by the acquisition of three divers and an advanced digital underwater camera from Southern Engineering Company (SECO). The boost comes after the Transport CS James Macharia toured the channel. A team of three private divers from South Africa that had been contacted by the family also joined the multi-agency team that has been going on with the operation for eight days. The ferry services management has said it will keep engaging with the family, calling for patience as operations continue. The channel had earlier been declared a 'military zone' in order to allow the team to carry out smooth operation without interruptions from the public. Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho had last week given the family Sh2 million to hire private divers from South Africa to assist in retrieving the bodies. Initially, the family had agreed to pay local divers Sh250,000 to retrieve the bodies. They had already paid Sh100,000 as a down payment for the exercise. Mwazo said the government will reimburse the family what they had paid to the private divers and cater for all other expenses. ODM leader Raila Odinga, Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia, Transport Principal Secretary Esther Koimett are among leader who has been to the Likoni channel since the tragedy happened.
