International forward Duke Abuya is determined to continue with his recent good form. Abuya impressed in Harambee Stars 1-0 loss to Mozambique on Sunday having come on as a second-half substitute for Clifton Miheso. The talented forward got his first league goal a week earlier as his Kariobangi Sharks side handed basement club Â Chemelil Sugar a fifth successive loss. "Everyday, I am working on the scoring aspect of my game. It is an area I know I can do better. I improved my goals tally last season and I want to do that this season again. I am unhappy that I have been slow to start my scoring but now that is behind me. I want to build on this and to continue scoring more and more goals. This season, my target is to hit ten goals as the minimum," said Abuya. Having finished with four goals last season, Abuya now has to add at least six more goals to achieve his targets. With 29 more games to go, it is very much possible that he will achieve it. "It is hard work. It's a personal goal for me which I know will at the end of the day help the team achieve their objective," added the Kenyan international. Abuya's exploits for Sharks have made him a regular call up to the national team. Besides, his confident display against Mozambique where he came close to putting Stars ahead with his well-timed header will not go unnoticed by the Stars technical bench led by Francis Kimanzi and Zedekiah Otieno. With the international week dispensed with, Sharks who are sitting uncomfortably in the bottom half of the Kenyan Premier League standings, resume league action this weekend with a tough trip to take on Gor Mahia. Meanwhile, reports have emerged that Nzoia United, who face Sofapaka this weekend, are looking to replace Collins 'Korea' Omondi after a series of unwanted results, losing three of their five matches. Omondi, previously a goalkeeping coach at Mathare United, has struggled to find his feet in his first head coach role in the top tier league.
