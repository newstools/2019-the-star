Kenya Ferry Services has denied claims that the MV Harambee developed a mechanical problem with passengers on board on Sunday. The report sparked reminders of the Likoni ferry accident on September 29 when a car plunged into the ocean from the MV Harambee. A woman and her daughter died. Speaking to the Star on the phone on Monday, Managing Director Bakari Gowa said the MV Harambee developed minor problems and was beached for maintenance and welding on the prow. The vessel was later returned to operations. "It is not true that MV Harambee developed a mechanical problem on Sunday. We were only doing minor works. That is the reason why the ferry was beached on the island. I assure the passengers our ferries are in good condition and they should not fear." MV Harambee, which has a capacity of 1,440 passengers and 50 vehicles, was said to have developed mechanical problems on its way to the island. Bakari said some minor repairs do not require the vessels to be taken to the dry dock. “The ferry that people are claiming developed some mechanical problem is working as we speak. Sometimes we see photos on social media which were taken a long time ago claiming is the current situation,” Gowa said. In the September 29 accident, Mariam Kighenda, 35, and her four-year-old daughter Amanda Mutheu died. Their bodies were retrieved after 13 days. The ferry boss has also said that they have suspended Mtongwe Ferry services for five months for renovations. Residents in Mtongwe will continue using the Likoni crossing channel. "Some of the work to be done include renovating the pontoons on both sides, dry docking, welding works, paintings and renovating pillars," Gowa said. Edited by R.Wamochie
