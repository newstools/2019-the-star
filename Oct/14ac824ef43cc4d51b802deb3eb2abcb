DCI George Kinoti wants Sarah Wairimu to serve him with application papers after contempt of court claims. Wairimu, the widow of slain businessman Tob Cohen, filed an application in court seeking to have the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions cited for contempt. Wairimu, through lawyer Philip Murgor, on Tuesday said the two agencies disobeyed an order issued on September 16 by Justice Jessie Lessit in which she directed that they desist from addressing the media on the investigations and evidence alleged to exist in the murder case. But Kinoti through his lawyers on Thursday said he had not been served with the papers. "At the moment he is out of the country on official assignment, but read online that you filed a contempt proceedings against him," his lawyer Donald Kipkorir said. "He has inquired from his office and they confirmed that you haven't served them with the alleged application. You should serve us with the said application." Wairimu  said that the "sustained media campaign against her is part and parcel of a large elaborate scheme by Kinoti, who has custody of her matrimonial property, to unlawfully appropriate her matrimonial home and hand it over on a silver platter to interested parties, including the siblings of the deceased".
