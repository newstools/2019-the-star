Starehe Girls Centre in Nairobi has been closed for three days after 52 girls were isolated due to an outbreak of what the management described as a 'common flu'. The School's Director, Sister Jane Soita told the Star that the learners were 'taking a break' as they probe the disease. "The learners will take a break until Monday," she said. The students sent home are Form Ones, Twos and Form Threes. Form Four students are still in school. Students and their parents were seen picking their children from school on Thursday. According to senior teachers, the students were apprehensive and wanted to go home. "There is a lot of tension in the school. Even students are wondering why they are in school and yet their colleagues are sick," one said. The students were isolated following cases of girls with a high-pitched cough, sneezing and low-grade fever in the school. The school on Tuesday said samples have been taken for further tests to determine the condition. The school said the condition is 'minor' and is being handled. Soita said parents of the affected students had been notified, adding that no one has been admitted.
