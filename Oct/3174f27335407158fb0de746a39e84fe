Police in Homa Bay have found a seven year old boy who was kidnapped from their home at Kenya Re in Kisumu last Sunday. The minor Akil Malik was reported missing on Sunday at around 12 noon. He was found on Wednesday at a home in Nyandiwa Suba South constituency in Homabay county. Homa Bay DCI boss Daniel Wachira said the minor was found alive. The police led by area OCDP Anthony Njeru found the boy after responding on a tip off from members of the public. “They reported to police after seeing a strange boy at the said home. The boy is currently at Magunga police station after police picked him,” Wachira said. The county CID boss said they have arrested a woman who allegedly kidnapped the boy. “She is in our custody for interrogations before arraigned,” he said. Wachira said they have sent the photographs of the boy to his parents who have identified him positively. “We’re putting arrangements to ferry the minor to Kisumu and reunite with his parents,” Wachira said. The officer said they will take the suspect to Kisumu so the case can be handled by Kondele police. The boy was living with his parents near Kondele before his disappearance.
