Busia MCAs have allocated Sh15 million in the supplementary budget tabled last Friday for the completion of Simba Chai Cassava Processing plant, in Teso South. Governor Sospeter Ojaamong asked the Budget and Appropriation Committee to set funds aside for the project. Ojaamong wrote a memorandum to the Linus Asiba-led committee on October 9. “My office is requesting you to allocate as per the attached budget to ensure the plant is up and running immediately. Your immediate action is required,” the governor said. Ojaamong reiterated that the cassava processing plant is a strategic project which can impact positively on the county’s food and nutrition security. The Sh10 million investment has however remained non-operational since its inception. The plant was expected to serve 15,000 cassava farmers in Busia and neighbouring  Bungoma and Siaya counties. In 2015, the then Agriculture executive Moses Mwanje appealed to farmers to plant cassava crop on a large scale since the region has high potential in cassava farming. Mwanje said cassava collection sites would also be constructed in delivery points, from where trucks would pick the produce to the main factory. “We shall have 14 collection centres in Busia and another two in Siaya and Bungoma,” he said. A two-acre piece of land has been allocated for the project by the county government. The budget that will be debated on Tuesday is crucial to unlocking the funds for completion of rollover projects and pending bills.
