Tanzanian singer Vanessa Mdee is rumoured to be dating Nigerian-American actor Rotimi. The two have been sharing photos in the same location, South Beach, Miami. Rumours go on to say that Vee Money and her new beau are at a baecation. Rotimi, real name Olurotimi Akinosho, acts as Darius Morrison on the Starz series 'Boss' and also stars as Andre Coleman on 'Power'.

Mdee was one of the judges in the recently concluded East Africa's Got Talent reality TV show, which was won by Uganda.
