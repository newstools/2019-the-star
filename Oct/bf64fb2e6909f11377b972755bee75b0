Microsoft has committed to advocating for women with an interest in security engineering through the SheHacks annual HackFest Festival. The global tech firm announced this during this year’s annual HackFest held at Strathmore Business School Friday. Speaking at the event, Hayden Hainsworth, general manager for Cybersecurity Engineering at Microsoft the mission is geared towards empowering customers and partners to get and stay secure on their journey to cloud while inspiring the next generation of cybersecurity engineers. “We are really delighted to be partnering with SheHacks for this year’s Hackathon, with a focus to prepare women to thrive in the technology industry. We want to make it easy for anyone to take their next step forward in technology,” Hainsworth said. On their part, SheHacks Founders Evelyn Kilel and Laura Tich emphasized the need for increased support towards youth in Kenya. “Since we founded this initiative, we have seen tremendous growth in the number of women and young people who want to take part. This year alone, we are hosting close to 300 young ladies from Kenya to equip and empower them with the required technical know-how to combat cyber-crime”, Tich said. SheHacks provides a great opportunity to empower more youth with the right skills – most urgent cybersecurity skills to accelerate digital success in the region.
