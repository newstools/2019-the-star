St Paul University captain Billy Makhety has blamed inconsistency for their unpleasant performances in the ongoing national handball league. The team lost 34-31 to Mount Kenya University-Thika at Kaloleni grounds in a heated head-to-head encounter yesterday. SPU took lead in the first half but slowed down towards the end, allowing MKU to score fast goals. "We started with good speed and played well but we lacked consistency. Had we maintained the speed, we would have won the game," Makhety said. SPU has so far won one game but Makhety is confident in his team's potential. He added that the absence of their senior-most player, Gibson Luyari, was another blow. "We played without Luyari and unfortunately, it affected our performance. Being the most experienced player, having him usually helps us as a team. However, I believe we still have room for improvement," added Makhety. The 21-year-old remarked that they have a chance to finish at a better position should they work on their physicality and improve on maintaining momentum. "We have to improve our physical game because we have to adapt to the changing weather. We train in cold climate and today we played under the scorching sun and thus we were easily drained," he observed. "We are a good team and we should be performing better than we are. Therefore, when we polish our weaknesses I am confident we will soar to greater heights."
