Police coach Patrick Mugambi has challenged his strikers to be more prolific in front of goal as the battle for a top-four finish hots up. The striking department has been a letdown to the team as law enforcers have failed to challenge for the Premier League title. The team, captained by Oliver Echenje, have only managed 24 goals in 12 matches to place fourth on the table with 21 points. The exit of strikers Amos Barkibir and Kalvins Kanu to Butali dealt the policemen a major blow. Police have had to stick with Govan Mbeki and Titus Kimutai upfront but the duo has not lived up to expectations. The last season runners up have won just six matches-the fewest among the top four teams. Their recent poor run is due to lack of goals even though they have been unlucky with injuries. The disciplined force has won only once in the last four matches, scoring as many goals. The team drew 1-1 with Sailors and lost 1-0 to defending champions Butali. Subsequently, their 2-1 loss against Wazalendo ended their title hopes. They redeemed themselves with 2-1 victory against Western Jaguars and can only finish second if they win their remaining matches. Police boast the Astro-turf and Yusuf Memorial trophies but a better performance from the striking department is all that Mugambi demands. The return of midfielder Willis Okeyo is a major boost as they seek to bounce back to winning ways. "Mbeki and Kimutai are good strikers but they need to shoulder the goal-scoring burden for the team. We have been delicate in attack but the duo can rediscover their scoring touch and help the team end the season strongly. Our midfield is much stronger with Okeyo back," said Mugambi. "We have played fewer matches than the rest and I believe we have what it takes to improve our position on the standings," noted the tactician.
