REIGNING women champions Equity Bank title defence suffered a serious jolt as star player Betty Kananu was ruled out for the season. Coach David Maina yesterday confirmed that Kananu will not be able to play again this year and called on his players to step up their efforts. “Betty is out until next year. The rest of the team now needs to step up ahead of the playoff quarter-finals this weekend,” he said. Kananu was injured during the FIBA Africa Zone 5 tournament in Dar-es-salaam and was unavailable in the bankers’ 68-54 loss to APR of Rwanda. Maina said the team was due to report for their first training session after the Dar show, where he will weigh his options before their opening playoff match. Equity Bank will this weekend play their final regular-season fixture against Strathmore University Swords. They are guaranteed a top slot. “We have confirmed our top placing in the league whether we win this game or not. Those picked in the team will have to step up.” Maina said. Kananu, who is also a starter in the national side, has been a standout in the team’s sterling run and a regular in the league. United States International University escaped relegation despite losing 70-52 to Storms in the Premier League. In the lower division playoff quarter-finals ties, Barclays Bank came from behind to shock Africa Nazarene University 64-60. KDF Morans defeated Kenyatta University Pirates 55-52 while Riara University Bucks torched Neosasa Morans 67-44 in another game.
