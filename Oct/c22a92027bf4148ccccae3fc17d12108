The unsafe and unseaworthy vessels reported in one of the dailies yesterday should be taken off Kenyan waters before another tragedy ensues. The MV Harambee, Nyayo and Kilindini were reported to be 10 years past their ‘use-by’ period of operation. The MV Harambee, off which a car slid and plunged into the ocean midstream killing two people on September 29, is a perfect example of why they should all be replaced. It was also revealed that coxswain steering the vessels are operating with licenses based on regulations passed in the 1970s. The state should train crew and issue them with up-to-date licenses for safety. We cannot afford to continue losing more lives sailing on death trap vessels at the Likoni ferry crossing channel.
