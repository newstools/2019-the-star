The Budalangi NG-CDF has spent Sh2.4 million to train250  motorbike riders on road safety. Budalangi MP Raphael Wanjala said he had taken the initiative to sponsor training of the motorbike riders considering that most of them could not afford proper training. He spoke on Friday at Port Victoria Trading Centre after presenting driving licenses to 175 motorbike riders who had attended a training and safety course. He said road accidents in Bunyala subcounty involving motorbike riders have been attributed to lack of training on road safety. “Many accidents have been caused by motorbike riders without knowledge of road safety and road regulations," Wanjala said. He said that was the reason the  Budalangi NG-CDF committee had spent Sh2.4 million to train riders across the constituency on road safety. Wanjala said corruption in training a problem, adding that recently the names of motorbike riders were listed for training — but they received none and got no licenses. He assured those yet to be trained that the committee would allocate more funds training funds during this financial year. The aim is to train all riders at thee 36 stages in the entire constituency , Wanjala said. He urged riders and passengers to wear helmets and reflector jackets, among other safety measures. “Your life is very important, so I  urge you to ensure you have strictly adhered to traffic rules and regulations," he said “It is now upon you to utilise the training you have acquired to reduce accidents," the MP said. Hw urged trained riders to ensure they renew their licenses regularly and urged them to buy accident insurance. (Edited by V. Graham)
