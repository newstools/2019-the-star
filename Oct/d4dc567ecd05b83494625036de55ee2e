Vlogger Natalie Tewa has accused her ex-lover Moses Mukiibi, alias Rnaze, of not returning a phone she lent him when they were dating. She wrote on Twitter that, "So he’s still using the phone I got from a job I did in 2017 that hasn’t paid me my money yet because he refused to give the phone back." The two broke up in March this year due to irreconcilable differences. At the time, she said Rnaze was a broke man in the relationship. "Brokest man I’ve been with, always prancing around a facade. Selfish, always to be ‘famous’. If you know you know," she wrote.
