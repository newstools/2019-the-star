Modesty Fashion Week was launched on Saturday at Laico Regency Hotel in Nairobi. The event promotes the youth and brings talents from different parts of the country to showcase designs from the Muslim communities. It was inspired by a model who chose to walk off the stage rather than take off her hijab. Nasra Yusuf, who is the founder of Modesty Fashion Week, said the event creates a platform for all Muslim models and designers to display their expertise.
