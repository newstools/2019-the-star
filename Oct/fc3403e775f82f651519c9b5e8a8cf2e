Health services were disrupted at Baringo County Referral Hospital after some 30 clinical officers went on strike against nonpayment of salaries for five months. Led by Laban Yego, the group matched around Kabarnet town with placards on Monday and chanting solidarity slogans while accusing Governor Stanley Kiptis of ignoring their plight. “We have not been paid a single penny since we were hired way back on May 20,” Yego said. But health Mary Panga exonerated her department from blame, saying it is the duty of the national government to pay the interns while on training. “The national government should actually look for a way of providing their up-keep while we look for ways of employing them,” Panga said. She said the county has 200 medical interns but has no money to pay them. Yego said the clinical officers decided to fully withdraw their services and will not resume duty until their salaries are paid in full. “We are saying enough is enough. Today, we have come to see Governor Kiptis to pass our grievances but we couldn’t find him in the office. So, we will have to wait for him until the time he is available to talk to us,” he said. “Our parents at home are happy thinking that their children are working with the government but it is very unfortunate that we still depend on them for our upkeep in town,” Gladys Kandie said. She said due to lack of money, they cannot meet their basic needs like paying rent, buying clothes and food. Another intern Tony Yator said it has been very painful working tirelessly without pay. “We had earlier approached Governor Kiptis but he told us there is no money to pay us,” he said. The county government reiterated that it is not their mandate to pay interns and they should appreciate the opportunity to offer voluntary services as they await employment.
