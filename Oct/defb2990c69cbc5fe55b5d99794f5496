Michael Kibet has put aside troubles that saw him fail to make the Kenya team to the IAAF world championships in Doha, Qatar last month and he is now ready to represent the country in the next two major events. Kibet, who was locked out of the team for non-compliance of doping rules despite winning the 5,000m race at the trials, is looking to represent Kenya at both the Africa cross country show and Olympic Games in Tokyo later next year. Kibet, who is fresh from winning the 2019 Ndalat Gaa cross country, said the Doha mess is behind him and he is ready for the bigger challenge ahead. “For now, my focus is to run good races locally as I look forward to the next two important races next year,” he said. The national cross country junior champion finished 5th at the 29th edition of the University of Eldoret cross country championships over the weekend. “When I heard of the controversies that characterised the whole saga, I kept quiet, relaxed and waited for the outcome, which did not favour me. Due to that, first I had to accept the outcome and look for the way forward,” he said. He added that he wants to compete in various Diamond League series as a build-up for the two important races on the calendar after he competed in Rabat and paced at Ostrava One Mile.
