Despite the current poor weather being witnessed in the country which has rendered most of the roads impassable, the 2019 Safaricom EA Safari Classic Rally will go on as planned. With the weatherman saying that the rains are expected to continue pounding, organizers of the rally set for November 27 to December 6 have maintained that the event is very much on course. The East African Safari Classic  Rally Limited general manager, Pipi Renu is confident of the team’s final preparations which include training marshals to man the route and control the crowds. “At the end of September, we took our team of route openers as well as stage commanders to familiarize them with the stages, which will run in Kenya. Both route openers inspected the stages, and we were now able to get more details and amendments to stage notes,” said Renu. He added: “I don’t think in the history of classic rally, has there been such an amount of attention put in ensuring the road book is defined and checked. The recce was carried out during extreme rain, and I am relieved to know the stages are all passable.” The security team of the rally has also spent time on the stages, identifying critical areas that will need control with 155 marshals in Kenya.  The team will now proceed to Tanzania to complete the same inspection.
