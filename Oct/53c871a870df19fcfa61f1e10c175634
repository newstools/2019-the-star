Top rapper Khaligraph Jones, aka Papa Jones, will be the headlining act in Bamburi, Mombasa, at the Tusker Lite Neon party. The 'Mazishi' hitmaker will be bringing fans together in the fun, glow-themed event, which comes after a successful rave night party last month at 1824 in Nairobi. The parties will be making rounds across the major towns in the country in a bid to give consumers a bold night out with their friends. KBL Premium Beers brand manager Barbra Kingori said, “It is all about setting new trends and new fun experiences. These parties are all about spending time, giving back and opening the doors of our vibrant lifestyle. Come ready to experience the best as we revolutionise the club scene in Kenya.”
