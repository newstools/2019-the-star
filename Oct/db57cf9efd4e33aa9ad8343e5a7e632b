Every bride wants to look beautiful, dazzling and make a lasting impression on her special day. The luxury wedding showcase brought this to reality by organising a fancy and affordable wedding setup, showcasing East Africa's finest wedding artisans on Saturday at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Upper Hill, Nairobi. The event was an interactive experience, featuring local and international luxury brands such as Jaguar, Johnny Walker blue label andÂ  Magana flowers. It also provided tips of all you need to know about weddings, beauty, style and great taste. The evening ended in style with a couple winning two Emirates business class tickets to Dubai and four nights at the Radisson Deira Creek and a dinner Dhow Cruise.
