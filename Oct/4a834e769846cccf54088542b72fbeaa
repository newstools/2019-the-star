Two motorcycle operators were killed on Wednesday morning in separate crashes by speeding motorists along the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road. The deaths prompted residents and the Naivasha Road Safety Group to call for urgent interventions. In the first case, a middle-aged man was killed while joining the Moi South Lake junction. He was struck by a trailer; the driver fled. Hours later another man was killed near Longonot Trading Centre. In the last month, about 10 riders have been killed, mainly along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. “Majority of those killed in this road accidents involving motorcycles are very young people and the trend is worrying,” Jabes Kabono from the safety group said. He said at least three operators die monthly and called for safety refresher courses. Four fatal accidents occurred near MoiJunction in the last two months and it's time we met operators," he said. Kabono cited drink-driving, lack of driving licences and lack of insurance as problems. “In some accidents, operators were not licensed while the motorcycles were not insured complicating the situation,” he said. In Mai Mahiu, passengers narrowly escaped death when the driver of their matatu lost control and it rammed into a building. They suffered only minor injuries. (Edited by V. Graham)
