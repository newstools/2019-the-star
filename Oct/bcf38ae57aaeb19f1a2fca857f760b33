Moi University has been shut down indefinitely following student unrest. The students on Friday protested against alleged poor management of the university. The students were angered by an increment in fees for supplementary exams and new rules on use of hostels. The university has increased the fees for the supplementary exams to Sh1,000 up from Sh400. Deputy vice chancellor Professor Nathan Kimengi issued a notice on Friday directing students to vacate the main campus immediately. Kimengi said the decision had been taken to suspend all programmes at the university because protesting students destroyed property at the institution. "The unrest has led to destruction of property, harassment and injury of some University officers hence the decision to shut down," said Kimengi in a notice released at the university. Kimengi said all students must clear from the college and leave to wait for further communication from the management. The students are against new regulations at the university requiring them not to cook meals in their hostels among other safety measures. The students threw stones at buildings at the main campus and two staffers were slightly injured. Students had initially issued eight demands, including hiring of more lecturers, reduction of fees for supplementary exams and sacking of the university chief security officer. They also protested against a move by the management to block some students from graduating last month. This comes after Kenyatta University closed the institution on Tuesday, citing student unrest.
