DPP Noordin Haji on Monday opened a four-day Training of Trainers on the role of the prosecutor in child justice. The DPP encouraged the use of the ODPP's new policies on diversion and plea bargaining in children matters to give them a second chance. "My office takes children and children matters seriously," the DPP said. He encouraged capacity building of stakeholders handling children cases. Haji said there was a need to adequately train all stakeholders to avert miscarriage of justice in children matters. The DPP emphasized that his office will continually monitor progress on prosecution of children matters, so as to inform areas of improvement.
