The politics of Kieleweke and Tangatanga are dangerous to Mt Kenya’s unity, Nyeri Senator Ephraim Maina has said. He said the two have been causing divisions among Mt Kenya residents. The senator wondered why leaders in Mt Kenya should be engaging in 2022 succession politics, while cash crops that were the mainstay of the region’s economy are collapsing. He urged politicians to focus their energies in fighting for better tea, coffee and milk prices to boost the area’s economy instead of concentrating on 2022 succession politics. Maina said the Kieleweke and Tangatanga politics already have a negative impact on the region. He cited the recent incident in Murang’a where Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro and nominated MP Maina Kamanda were engaged in a confrontation at Gitui Catholic church.  “People should start ignoring politicians who tell them about 2022,” he said. On Punguza Mizigo Bill, Maina said Thirdway Alliance leader Ekuru Aukot should tell Kenyans where he is getting the resources to finance his activities. He faulted Aukot for coming up with the Bill without first taking the views of the people. “In Nyeri, people could not buy his idea of reduction of constituencies from six to one, yet people have been fighting for the creation of more constituencies,” he said. Maina however backed the BBI, saying it will help address the many challenges facing Kenyans at the moment. The senator said the BBI task force members are mature politically, highly experienced and wise.
