Six MPs from Western have warned DP William Ruto not to set foot in the region after the eviction of members of Luhya community in Nandi. Led by Kakamega senator Cleophas Malala, the six said Ruto is unwelcomed in Western so long as the evicted Luhyas are not given back their land. Close to 1,500 families were rendered homeless after they were evicted in Nandi following a tussle over land. The MPs said houses, churches and schools were demolished during the operation on Wednesday night. "I don't want to mince my words on this, I want to tell the Deputy President you are not welcome in our area if our people are being evicted from Nandi," Malala said during a presser on Thursday. The other MPs are; Caleb Amisi ( Saboti), Florence Mutua (Busia woman representative), George Aladwa ( Makadara), Geoffrey Osotsi (nominated) and ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna. Osotsi said the community will not tolerate the inhumane manner the eviction has been carried out. "We do not want to have friends only when they come to look for votes," Osotsi said. The leaders appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene saying a number of students sitting this years national examination risks missing the all important exams. Ruto has been a frequent visitor in Western region and is expected to attend burial of former Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale first wife in Ikolomani on Saturday.
