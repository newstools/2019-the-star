Comedian Terence Creative is yet to talk with his wife Milly Chebet about his extramarital affair. He opened up about having an affair saying, “Yes, I did it. And through it, I have learnt my lesson. “Milly and I will talk about it someday.” He denied they are getting a divorce and blamed the devil for causing him to cheat saying, “Shetani hukuja kwa njia mingi. Ashindwe kabisa. Aki sitarudia tena [Satan comes in many forms. I won’t do it again].”
