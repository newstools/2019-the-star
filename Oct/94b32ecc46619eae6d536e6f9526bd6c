The state should find another alternative method of disposing of the old Sh1000 notes as burning them will pollute the environment. For instance, CBK should now be seeking contracts with hardboard makers and sell shredded notes to them so that they are recycled. This is a more efficient way of disposing of the old notes rather than burning since it reduces the carbon footprint. The shredded currency can also be exported to other countries that produce furniture items like photo frames, mirror frame backing, book shelves and drawer bottoms. They can also be converted into biomass briquettes to be used as fuel for factory boilers. Biomass briquettes have a less negative impact on the environment since they are made of renewable materials. Different qualities of paper can produce different amounts of biofuel. Paper that has not been recycled often produces a lot more energy since it goes through electric machines, high temperatures and a lot of heat that causes its energy to reduce. The old currency notes are very hard and to convert them to biomass briquettes, a lot of energy is used. This results in them having less energy. Converting old notes to biomass is better than burning them and it may be a little costlier than simply burning them. Lastly, in the agricultural sector, shredded paper notes can be used as soil improver. The state should lead an example by recycling the old notes as this will manifest the importance of recycling resources. Media student, Mombasa
