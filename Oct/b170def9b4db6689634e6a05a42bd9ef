Politicians from across the divide paid tribute to Citizen TV's Hussein Mohammed as he exited the station after 10 years of service. ODM leader Raila Odinga described Hussein as one of the best interviewers the station has ever had. "He struck me as someone who did his homework and knew answers to the questions he asked," he said. Raila said Hussein would ask questions that interviewees would sometimes find irritating, but he was persistent. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka wished Hussein the best. Others who sent him messages were Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa, MP Sabina Chege, ODM chairman John Mbadi and Hussein's former boss and Lands CS Farida Karoney. Hussein has been reading prime time news every Tuesday and has also conducted high profile interviews. In his final show, he hosted Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen and National Assembly Minority Leader John Mbadi. Earlier this month, Hussein announced his exit from the media house having worked with the company for 10 years. Announcing his exit, he tweeted,Â "It has been a wonderful 10 years at Citizen TV. I have enjoyed & relished every moment I shared with my colleagues at RMS. I have decided to take a break after October In Sha Allah to concentrate on other matters. Loved the fans, the critics & everything in between. See you soon." His exit comes barely three years after his former co-host Janet Mbugua quit to pursue personal projects.
