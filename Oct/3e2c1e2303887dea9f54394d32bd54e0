More than 1,000 goats that had survived a long drought were killed by a downpour and heavy flooding on Thursday evening in Gither ward of Mandera West subcounty. The county government and the National Drought Management Authority have been giving relief rations and trucking in water during the dry spell. MCA Ahmed Rashid said, "It is a very unfortunate incident as the goats were very weak and could not survive the heavy downfall. He said a family migrating from Gither to Ethiopia in search of pasture lost more than 400 goats, " Rashid said. The MCA said the death toll could be higher because some areas are inaccessible and have no communication due to poor network coverage. He called on the county, and national government and other donor agencies to help restock livestock "as this was their only means of livelihood". National Drought Management Authority coordinator Hussein Alio promised the government will help the families restock. Alio said resources were limited, however. The short rains are expected in two weeks as the drought worsens. Edited by R.Wamochie
