Marianne Kitany's lawyers on Tuesday painted the picture of a womaniser, when describing her estranged husband and Meru Senator Mithika Linturi. Kitany is a former aide in Deputy President William Ruto's office. While cross-examining Fr Jason Micheni, the man who said he officiated Linturi's marriage to his first wife, Kitany's lawyer, Danstan Omari, brought up several other women whom the senator is accused of having relationships with and siring children with. Omari asked Micheni whether he was aware that at the time he officiated the marriage, Linturi was married to another woman by the name Susan Gacheri. Omari said the couple had two daughters, the first born in 1995. The cleric denied knowledge of any previous union. Linturi had a son with Mercy, whom he claims to be his first wife, before their wedding. Omari brought up another woman Linturi allegedly had a son with eight years ago by the name ofÂ  Hellen Mumbi. The lawyer continued to grill Micheni on whether he knew that when Linturi wrote his letter of application to UoN, the senator stated that he was separated. Omari went on to show the cleric a picture of Linturi and Kitany at Sopa Lodge enjoying themselves. He confirmed that it was indeed Linturi and Kitany. Omari told Micheni that in the photo, the two were not reading the Bible, and went on to describe them as good lovers. Micheni had said he officiated Linturi's marriage to Mercy on April 8, 2000 at Tigania Parish.
