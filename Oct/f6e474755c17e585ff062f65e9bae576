Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya has urged the youth to join technical and vocational training colleges to nurture and grow their talents. Mvurya, who spoke on Tuesday at Tiwi in Matuga, said learning sharpens the mind to develop new innovative ideas on how to manage abilities. “Someone who is learned always has a sharp brain which assists in developing unique ways of doing things,” he said, adding that some of the skills only need a little education to be fully exploited. The county chief said the youths will be in an advantageous position when they have a variety of practical skills. Certificates, he noted, will also help them to secure employment in both the private and public sectors. “The papers you get after graduating are a window to other job opportunities because you can apply for work anywhere in Kenya." During teenage, one must be cautious as it is the age when some individuals lose focus and get lured into things that kill careers, the governor said. “At this age, youths are vulnerable and it is when logic must be applied to every decision to avoid missing your objectives in life." He said the economy will be enhanced if women are given equal opportunities with men. He urged parents to guide their children in nurturing their talents. Edited by R.Wamochie
