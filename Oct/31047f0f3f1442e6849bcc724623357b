Residents of Darad in Kwale county have been urged to remain calm as the government helps resolve their land dispute. The 500 families and Leisure Lodge are fighting over 187 acres on Diani Beach, South Coast. In May, the High Court in Nairobi ordered all people living 0n the land evicted and any structures on it demolished. It said they had trespassed on Leisure Lodge's land. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i visited Ukunda on Wednesday and held a closed-door meeting with the residents and county leaders. He urged the residents to cooperate with law enforcement officers to resolve the matter in court. “I would advise that you support security agencies in compiling the required facts that will facilitate the court with enough proof to solve the issue,” Matiang'i said. He said the government is determined to ensure land conflicts are resolved amicably and fairly. The CS said the government has already filed a petition to revoke the court order that directed the eviction of the residents. “Through the office of the Attorney General, we have moved to court and applied a notice of a petition to stop the orders from being implemented until the petition is heard,” Matiang'i said. He said they engaged all stakeholders and urged them to hold more peace talks before reaching a conclusion. Matiang'i cautioned leaders against inciting residents over land issues, saying they should let the courts handle such matters. He praised Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya for supporting efforts to find an amicable solution to the dispute. He said Mvurya has brought together the parties involved and initiated talks with the national government. Mvurya said Darad is the heart of Diani economy and the Kwale government, in partnership with the national government, will continue to hold discussions to reach a favourable agreement.
