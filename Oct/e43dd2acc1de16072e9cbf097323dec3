The Migori county assembly on Wednesday rejected  the Punguza Mizigo Bill. The assembly’s Justice and Legal Affairs Committee, which has 11 members, received the bill on July 22 this year and dropped the bill after being tabled by Rosline Ayoo, a nominated member and chairperson of the committee. “We had a series of meetings and as a committee, we realised the bill does not meet the threshold as it did not include public participation,” Ayoo said. She said the bill only had collected signatures as a substitute to meeting the public. “The public and other stakeholders never had any part in the bill, and only saw this through collected signatures,” Ayoo said. Migori said the reduction of the number of constituencies from 290 to 47 and scrapping of nomination slots by proposing election of male and female representatives was going against the spirit of representation and devolution enshrined in the Constitution. “The bill proposes scrapping of the position of the deputy governor while leaving the same in position of the deputy president, which is retrogressive,” Ayoo said. She said both offices were created by the Constitution and serve the same function to elected leaders.
