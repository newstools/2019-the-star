Leaders from Garissa county have vowed to reject the Punguza Mizigo Bill and promised to support the Building Bridges Initiative. Speaking in Sankuri town on Monday during a development tour, the leaders said they had gone through the proposals and found out that Punguza Mizigo does not address the issues affecting people in the county. Governor Ali Korane said they were eagerly waiting for the recommendations of the BBI task force, having given their views during the countrywide forums. He said the reason for supporting the BBI was that their recommendations were based on President Kenyatta's Big Four agenda. The governor urged politicians and residents to shun early politicking and instead focus their energies on development. Balambala MP Omar Shurie said there was no single good thing in Thirdway Alliance party leader Akuru Aukot’s Bill. The leaders will sit down with assembly members and implore to them to shoot it down, he said. “From where I sit, this is not a Bill that should be discussed in the first place. Our good brothers and sisters from the assembly should just shoot this Bill down and focus their energies on more important things,” he said. Last month, most MCAs led by majority leader Mohamed Gabow and assembly  speaker Ibrahim Abass promised to unanimously pass the bill. They addressed the press after listening to Aukot explain its details. National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale is on record warning the MCAs against passing the bill, saying they risked the wrath of the people if they dared pass it. At least 14 county assemblies have rejected Aukot's Punguza Mizigo Bill on the grounds it seeks to reduce the number of elected representatives.
