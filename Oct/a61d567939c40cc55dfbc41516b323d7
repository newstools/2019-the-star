Seasoned Sofapaka striker Philip Muchuma is keen to hit the ground running this weekend when he faces his former employers Nzoia Sugar at the Sudi Stadium. Since joining the club from the struggling Chemelil Sugar at the start of the season, Muchuma is yet to open his goal account with the 2009 champions in the five rounds played. The former Zoo FC man is looking to capitalise on his maiden start and win coach Divaldo Alves's faith after playing second fiddle to the duo of Brian Nyakhan and Kepha Aswani in the past rounds. Muchuma and Nyakhan were signed to replace the duo of Steven Waruru and Umaru Kasumba who decamped to KCB and Zesco United respectively. The departed duo had 23 goals between them last season. "The coach has already told me I will start against Nzoia this weekend. I want to repay the faith with a goal or an assist as well as open my account. I have been making cameos but now that I have been assured of the starting roles, I am eager to prove I am equal to the task. I and Nyakhan have been tasked to fill in the shoes of the former strikers who left the club and we are catching up and soon we will match up the expectations.” The former Oserian striker has in the meantime set a target of netting ten goals this season. He, however, admits to being under pressure to deliver in a club deemed as a title contender. Sofapaka have finished within the top five bracket in the last three seasons. “I have been the top scorer at Chemelil for three seasons but life here is quite different. There is a lot of pressure here as the objective is to fight for the league unlike at Chemelil where the aim was keeping the top-flight status. Nonetheless, I have a personal target of scoring ten goals this season and I believe I will.”
