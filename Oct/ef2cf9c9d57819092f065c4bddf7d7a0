Police officers from Bondo subcounty have arrested two suspects and confiscated bhang and illicit brews in an ongoing crackdown in Siaya county. County police commander Francis Kooli said officers ambushed and arrested Charles Okatch and Eugene Nyagudi at Jaelisha area. Kooli said that the duo was found trafficking bhang worth Sh500,000 and 23 jerricans of chang'aa amounting to 460 litres. During the raid, the outlawed Simba Waragi drink in 144 bottles amounting to 295 litres was impounded. Another 70 packets of Supermatch cigarettes worth over Sh10,500 was also confiscated. Kooli said that the suspects will appear before a Bondo court to face charges. The police chief asked the public to furnish them with information that will lead to the arrest of those engaged in illegal businesses. He regretted that despite government efforts to eradicate the supply and consumption of the outlawed drinks, the substance still finds its way through porous borders into the county. Kooli warned that they will not relent in the fight against the consumption and trade of illegal substances in the region.
