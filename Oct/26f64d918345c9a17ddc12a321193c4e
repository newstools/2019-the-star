Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama has sacked all county executives and asked those interested in joining his cabinet to apply by October 11. The sacking of the executives came just a month to the end of their two-year contracts. The executives' contracts were to expire on November 2. Nyagarama placed an advert in the media calling for applications for all the 10 positions of county executives to serve for a period of three years. Applicants must satisfy requirements of Article Six of the Constitution and must understand the diversity of the county. Women, people with disabilities and marginalised groups were encouraged to apply. Sources told the Star Nyagarama is likely to reconsider some executives except two "whose fate have been sealed." “The governor has communicated to the two and thanked them for their services,” the source said. One of the executives told the Star he was done with the county government. “I'm now a former minister. I don't know how I will work from tomorrow since our positions have been advertised,” the executive who asked not to be named said. Nyagarama recently declined to renew contracts of some of his advisers who have been viewed as the stumbling block in the county's administration. Last week, the county assembly refused to vet chief officers and called for the impeachment of the governor for failing to reinstate ECDE teachers. The assembly had earlier resolved to have all ECDE teachers reinstated. “The house has resolved that as long as ECDE teachers have not been reinstated, vetting of nominees for chief officers stands suspended,” a letter from speaker Moffat Teya to the governor reads. “We have also resolved that collection and verification of signatures for the impeachment of the governor should commence.”  Edited Peter obuya
