Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has offered Sh2 million to help fly two deep sea diving specialists from South Africa to help the two bodies and the wreckage of Sunday ferry tragedy. Mariam Kighenda and her four-year-old daughter drowned when their car slithered off ferry into the sea on Sunday at 6.15pm. Their bodies are yet to be found. KFS and a multi-agency team are carrying out the recovery operation. Joho offered the cash to the widower, John Wambua, who handed it to officials of Subsea Services who are to bring divers. “We have been following up the salvage operations. Feedback is 'There is a challenge, challenge, challenge'; let us get a concrete solution,” Joho said when he arrived at the ferry to condole with the family members. Joho said the divers will compliment ongoing efforts and speed up recovery of the bodies. “I want to thank you for that offer. Your assistance is welcome,” said Dan Mwanzo, the Kenya Ferry Services chairman. Government spokesman Cyrus Oguna said the divers had identified 10 points where the wreckage of the car could be. The family members blasted the state for what it termed a slow response to the incident. “Did we have to import people from South Africa? What is the business of transporting people if there is nothing the Kenya Ferry can do?” posed Monicah Wangari, a relative. Kenya Ferry Services have suspended operations for the second time as salvage operations continue.
