Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has declared Thursday a public holiday. Matiang'i, in a statement on Tuesday, said October 10 will be Moi Day. Moi Day was removed from the list of national holidays following promulgation of the Constitution in August 2010. But the High Court reinstated the day to be marked as a holiday on grounds its removal was in contravention of the Public Holidays Act. Kenya had been marking the holiday since 1988, when President Daniel arap Moi marked 10 years in power but it was scrapped in 2010. Matiang'i in his statement cited the Judicial Review No. 292 of 2017, where the Court affirmed that October 10 remains a public holiday. The CS urged Kenyans to mark Moi Day with "selfless acts of service to their community that seek to promote patriotism, national unity, social justice, cohesion and sustainable development". Kenya has 12 public holidays, five of them based on religion. One holiday, Labour Day, is set aside to celebrate workers in different sectors. Four holidays are based on the countryâ€™s Independence and two presidents. Kenyatta Day was however converted to Mashujaa Day. Boxing Day is also set in the law as a public holiday. Theories have it that people are supposed to open gifts exchanged on Christmas Day.
