Three weeks before they start their campaign to qualify for the African Cup of Nations in Cameroon, Kenya’s national football team, Harambee Stars slid one place down to 108th in the Fifa world football rankings released on Thursday evening. Stars drop was as a  result of their 1-0 home defeat in a friendly against Mozambique earlier this month. Francis Kimanzi, the coach who was at the helm when Kenya attained their highest ever ranking of 68th in the world over ten years ago, has his work cut out if the national team is to qualify for a second successive Afcon showpiece after their appearance in Egypt in June. Stars will face the Pharaohs in their first 2021 Afcon qualifier in Cairo on November 11. A home match against Togo awaits a week later. Stars are in Group G with minnows Comoros the other team. The top team in the group qualify automatically in the 24-team expanded tourney. Belgium continue to top the rankings with world champions France second. Brazil, England and Uruguay complete the top five. AFCON losing finalists Senegal (20) are the top team in Africa followed respectively by Tunisia(29), Nigeria(35), Afcon champions Algeria (38) and Morocco (42). In the Cecafa region, Uganda Cranes (79) continue to head the pack followed by Kenya and Sudan (128).
