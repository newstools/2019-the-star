A country music festival called 'Country Roads'Â recently took place at Thika Greens Golf Resort. Hundreds of country music fans dressed in cowboy regalia attended the event, which takes place every two months. An original idea of media personality Jeff Koinange, a country music enthusiast, the gig started in the afternoon with a brunch courtesy of White Cap Lager. It featured local country musicians Sir Elvis, Kareh B and benga-rhumba singer Kidum, who entertained country music lovers late into the night. The show was hosted by Koinange and stand-up comedian Prof Hamoo. Kieni West MP Kanini Kega was in attendance.
