Former Deputy Auditor General Stephen Kinuthia has been released on a Sh10 million cash bail. Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti on Wednesday further directed him to deposit his passport in court. His sons; Desmond Kinuthia and Nelson Kinuthia were also released on a Sh5 million and Sh3 million cash bail respectively. Kinuthia was charged alongside 13 others including Charles Njuguna, an advocate of the High Court, with buying an audit vault software at Sh100,675,680 against its estimated cost. The suspects, however, denied the charges before Ogoti on Tuesday. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Corruption CEO Twalib Mbarak last week said the DPPÂ had reviewed the file and given consent to charge the officers with conspiracy to commit an economic crime, conflict of interest and unlawful acquisition of public property. The said software was purchased from Open Systems Integration Kenya through direct procurement, purporting to be the only accredited partner of Oracle to supply the audit vault software.
