There was nothing to separate promotion hopefuls Talanta and Mount Kenya United as they battled to a 1-1 draw in an enthralling National Super League clash at Camp Toyoyo yesterday afternoon. Anthony Gichu put Talanta ahead with a well-disguised free-kick with half an hour played before Clement Masikidi replied for Mt. Kenya, finishing off a good team move five minutes later. The mid-table duel only came alive midway through the first half with both sides creating some good opportunities. Talanta were the first to threaten when a routine long ball by Gichu caught goalkeeper Adisa Zamu flatfooted. To his relief,  the ball trickled just wide off the far post. Mt. Kenya responded immediately with John Ndirangu combining with Eric Kipkirui and unleashing a shot that was saved by Joel Bataro. Mt. Kenya replaced skipper Samson Ndegwa with Edwin Wanjala and soon after, they were behind. The opening goal came in the 30th minute when Gichu’s free-kick evaded everybody before nestling the corner of the net. Francis Mwangi’s men responded immediately as Hussein Puzzo, Wanjala and Ndirangu combined to pick out Masikidi, who slotted the ball past Bataro. Both sides made attacking changes in the second half in pursuit of the winning goal with Kevin Ndung’u replacing Masikidi and Talanta taking off Rodgers Omondi for Bramuel Kayana. Harun Nyakha and Kipkirui both had chances to win the game for Mt. Kenya in a frantic finish to the match but they wasted them. Earlier, the match pitting Northern Wanderers and Administration Police failed to kick off. Wanderers, who were the home side did not book the match venue and neither did they bother to show up. The grapevine has been rife with reports that the team, sponsored by a senior politician, had folded up after failing to win any of their eight matches to date. Yesterday’s no-show goes a long way to confirm the rumours as the team had not officially communicated to the federation their intentions to call it quits.
