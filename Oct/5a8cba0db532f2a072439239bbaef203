Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok has promised to back a referendum if it pushes for additional resources to counties to promote development. There is a heated conversation on whether there is a need to change the Constitution. The Thirdway Alliance's Punguza Mizigo Bill, governor's Ugatuzi Initiative are some of the proposals. Nanok, who ditched ODM to join the Tangatanga movement, on Saturday said he will support a constitutional change that allows increased devolved funds. The governor urged MCAs to put the interests of Turkana residents first before considering which proposal to be passed. He said the Council of Governors supported the Ugatuzi proposal which advocates for additional budgetary allocation to counties among other constitutional changes that would further strengthen the performance of the devolved units. However, Deputy President William Ruto asked leaders to focus on service delivery rather than engaging in constant politics. “We have to put our energy on making Kenya better for everybody. This county will not be transformed through constant calls for a referendum,” he said early September in Subukia, Nakuru county. Nanok said, "The ongoing debate on the various proposals to amend the Constitution should be centred to benefit the common mwananchi at the grassroots level and not to stifle devolution." He spoke in Kapedo during the burial of Mwalimu Nicodemus Aruoto, a former teacher at Silale Primary School. Edited by R.Wamochie
