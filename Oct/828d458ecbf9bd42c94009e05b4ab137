Six staff managers were this month dismissed at the embattled Nairobi Club. This is after five board members also resigned four months after being elected into office, to run the facility. They claimed that their colleagues on the board were disobeying governance principles on how to run the facility. Those staff managers dismissed include the chief accountant, procurement manager, assistant food and beverage manager, Food and Beverage controller, accountant and the credit controller manager. “The club will pay your salary up to September 14 and leave days and off days but not taken. It will less any statutory deductions, loans advances and any other deductions that may be lawfully effected,” stated the six letters from the acting CEO Wycliff Adem. Minnie Mbue, Allen Kimani, Joseph Kering and Azu Ogola resigned four months into office due to claims of improper handling of human resource matters and disregard of procurement processes. The current board consists of Luke Musau, Francis Maina (GM Minet Insurance), Edwin Rono and Steve Biko. Insiders add that the current president -Charles Wambugu-is being sidelined in policymaking at the club, which hosts among others President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto as honourary members. “We pay salaries of Sh 8.5 million and the club receives Sh9.4 million from all income sources against a debt of 120 million,” a senior member of the club told other members in a WhatsApp group seen by the Star. A KPMG report early this year established irregular procurement procedures, variance in projects and misappropriation of funds among the key factors affecting the growth of the facility.
