World Under-20 1,500m champion George Manang’oi plans as he kicks off training next week after a disappointing debut at the recent IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar. The 19-year-old launched his bid to follow his sibling Elijah Manang’oi’s footsteps during the recently concluded global championships in Qatar but crashed out in the first round after finishing tenth on 3:38.39. Prior to Qatar show, Elijah was the defending champion but an ankle injury kept him out of contention. The youthful athlete is seeking to resume training at the Rongai Sports Club with an eye of rediscovering his form in readiness for next year’s Diamond League and Olympic Games in Tokyo. The World U-18 champion was almost a sure bet to cruise in his maiden appearance at the senior level but found the going tough. The 2017 silver medallist Timothy Cheruiyot emerged the winner in the finals. He said the dismal performance in Qatar prompted him to take an unusual break from holiday and will have the Doha meeting set for next year in April as his first competitive event. “I am looking to resume training next week with the aim of rediscovering my form. I did not finish this year’s season well in Doha and I have to start righting the wrongs I made. I struggled with a knee injury and I am almost fully fit,” he said. He added: “I want to start early preparations for the Diamond League legs which will put me in good shape for the Olympics qualifiers." The Olympics are set to be held between July 24 to August 9 in Tokyo, Japan. “I already know what it takes to compete at the senior level. The race at the global stage is fast and I believe the Diamond Leagues will boost my endurance before the Olympics. The competition for the slots in the qualification will be equally high thus the early onslaught.”
