The Kitui county government aims to sell locally made clothes in the international market. “We have an ambitious plan to ensure that Kitui apparel products are on international markets,” Governor Charity Ngilu said on Sunday. She said the dream was achievable if the county attained a high level of efficiency and deployed the latest technology at Kitui County Textile Centre. The governor is in Taiwan attending the 23rd edition of Taipei Innovative Textile Application Show. “From TITAS, we hope to see a better and more efficient Kicotec. We will utilize the lessons from TITAS 2019 to accelerate production of world-class apparels,” Ngilu said in a statement. The governor said TITAS was one of the largest gatherings of the textile world with a focus on sustainable, smart and functional textiles. “In February 2018, I made a similar benchmarking trip to India where I visited Brandix in India’s apparel district. I came back and set up our textile factory, now famed Kitui County Textile Centre,” Ngilu said. The governor said AGOA presents an opportunity for Kenya to have special access to the US market which remains largely underutilized. “As a county, we are ready and willing to take advantage of  this and other opportunities to ensure that we put more young people in jobs, generate revenue and create wealth for our people,” Ngilu said. Currently Kicotec has employed more than 350 youth and created opportunities for hundreds of Kitui residents.
