Over 20 Kenya’s fastest off-road racers are expected to contest in Sosian Rally Raid, the final round of the 2019 Kenya National Rally Raid Championship next weekend. And whilst Ross Field (CRT) has one hand firmly on the championship trophy, Mark Glen is prepared to pull all the stops in a bid to end the season on a high. However, the two title protagonists will have to contend with the return of former champion Gray Cullen, who is debuting his much-awaited Mercedes AMG-powered monster and Kenyan Rally champion Flash Tundo, who will also debut his new beast. There are a total of five of the South African built V8 Century Racing CRTs’ on the entry list while Ian Duncan heads the modified category. The Naivasha region has strong support as modified leader Joost Zurbier, Alisdair Keith and Geoff Mayes, who led the last round briefly, will all be heading north for what promises to be a mud-fest. The bike category is also well supported with Round 3 winner Shivam Vinayak heading the bike entries. The two-day rally raid will be the first of its’ type on Sosian Ranch in Laikipia and promises to offer a real challenge to all competitors.
