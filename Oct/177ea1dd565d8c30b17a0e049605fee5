Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has asked Kenyans to ignore speculations alleging that Monday will be a public holiday. The CS said the gazette notice doing rounds on social media that October  28 is a  holiday is fake. "Kindly ignore a gazette notice circulating on social media claiming Monday 28th October 2019 to be a public holiday. Monday remains a normal working day," he said via a tweet on Friday. The letter had claimed that Monday will be a Diwali Day, celebrated by Hindus, and thus a public holiday. Last week, Petroleum CS John Munyes said Hindus should ensure fireworks display during Diwali celebrations are done in orderly manner. Munyes in a notice on Tuesday said the fireworks display should not  inconvenience the public.
