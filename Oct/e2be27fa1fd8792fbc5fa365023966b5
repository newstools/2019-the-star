Rose Muhando says her management took away everything she worked hard for because she refused to play ball. "I was sick; I went through problems. My management took away everything I had. There are things that I did not want to do and that was the start of all my problems." she told a local radio station. "For example, I cannot walk with someone's husband. I didn't want to be a slave of sex. Even though he created a scandal for me because I refused him. How many times have I been driven to the mountains at gunpoint?" Muhando rubbished drug addiction allegations. "I don't even know how drugs look like. However, there is a big secret that I cannot say.Â  I have never used drugs."
