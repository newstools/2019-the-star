I'll forgive her for stripping but only if she apologises in writing and promises never to take off her clothes again at Wilson Airport. That's what Kenya Aeronautical College director Samson Aketch told the court on Tuesday as conditions to pardon the woman who says they had been dating. Kiss and makeup and charges will be dropped. That's what the court said — in effect — on Tuesday. On July 3, Dorcas Nduku was charged with invading Wilson Airport on July 3 and causing a disturbance by stripping down to her underwear and shouting. She allegedly demanded to see Aketch. Nduku had denied the charges before Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto. She said that Aketch had invited her to visit him, saying they had been dating for a long time. Aketch had been sending her love texts, she said. Court documents said that as police and security guards tried to get Nduku off the property, she took off her clothes, remaining only in her underwear. On Tuesday Nduku seemed relaxed and composed, saying nothing after the magistrate ordered that the two agree on the way forward and inform the court. Senior resident magistrate Renee Kitagwa said the charges would be dropped if they agreed. Kiss and make up. The matter will be mentioned on November 28. Edited by R. Wamochie
