Deputy President William Ruto has said the Agricultural Society of Kenya is playing a key role in educating farmers about new technologies to improve agricultural production. “The use of modern technology will help the country achieve food stability, a pillar in the Government's Big Four agenda,” Ruto said. He asked to ASK to continue creating a platform for technology developers to meet with technology users, which he said will drive agriculture on the basis of technology. He spoke on Thursday during the National International Trade Fair which is going on at Jamhuri Park Showground in Nairobi. Ruto said the government is working on the improvement of infrastructure around the ASK Jamhuri Park Showground in order to make the neighborhood habitable. He said part of the improvement includes the expansion of Ngong Road which he said will ease traffic. Construction of a new water pipeline from Kabete through Dagoretti to Jamhuri Park and Kibra is part of the plans that the government has put in place. Ruto assured ASK of the Government's support in its development plans. President Uhuru Kenyatta opened the ASK show on Wednesday and will be running up to October 6th. He said the government is undertaking measures to ensure that a new generation of farmers emerges to sustain the agricultural sector in the country. The President said there is a need to ensure the sustainability of the agricultural sector by encouraging the participation of the nation's youth through technology and innovation.
