Football Kenya Federation hasÂ cancelled Harambee Starlets' training schedule ahead of their Olympics qualifier match against Zambia due to lack of cash. Starlets are set to face Zambia next month in the penultimate qualifying round, but the federation has cited lack of government response as the reason behind the latest development. The federation on Tuesday said it is ready to bite the bullet, withdraw the team from the competition and face sanctions from CAF, which include hefty fines and being blacklisted for next year's Afcon qualifiers. The Nick Mwendwa-led federation argues it has survived on debts in the previous rounds against Malawi and Ghana despite making timely requisition for funds from the ministry. They accuse Principal Secretary Kirimi Kaberia of frustrating their efforts to get money from the Sports Fund.
