A New Zealand couple hospital has set up an affordable eye clinic in Bungoma's Malaha in Webuye West constituency. David Tetty and Keith Tetty, who have been living in Kenya for more than two years, decided to set up Kingdom faith-based hospital to eliminate the many long trips patients have been making to Sabatia in Vihiga county and Tororo eye hospital in neighbouring Uganda country. Hospital medical director Job Kisiangangi said that the couple decided to set up the facility because many people across the county have severe eye problems, especially the elderly persons. "We thought it wise to have such a facility here since we did not have any eye hospital around here and we so we wanted one that could offer good quality eye treatment at a lower cost,â€™ he said. He said that many people have been suffering from such problems while some have even gone blind for lack of money to travel all the way to Sabatia or Tororo in search of care Kisiangani said that the facility with a modern eye theatre and eye care equipment will help patients across western in Webuye, Mumias, Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega and also parts of Trans Zoia. Elizabeth Beka from Webuye town who has been having eye problems since 2007 said the facility that will be assisting her and other patients get quality eye services. She said it's God's plan that the couple set up the facility to assist many people who usually congest the Webuye Nyayo county hospital. David Tetty, director of the facility, said that he was happy that his dream of having a full eye hospital with operations has been realised after planning for more than four years. "We have come here all the way from New Zealand to set up this facility for the community to benefit. We only ask the community to support as and we will treat them to the best of our ability," he said. (Edited by V. Graham)
