Kenya's national under 20 team battled their way past Eritrea to reach the finals of the Cecafa under 20 boys Challenge Cup going on in Jinja, Uganda. The Rising Stars needed a late own goal from Yosef Mebrahtu to claim the 1-0 win and set up a date against Tanzania on Saturday. The Tanzanians had earlier beaten Sudan 2-1 thanks to goals from Israel Mwenda and Kelvin John with Abbas Namir pulling one back for Sudan. Stanley Okumbi named a strong side with Musa Masika, Bernard Ochieng and Patrick Otieno leading a fearsome attack. However, just like in their quarter-final clash against Burundi, Rising Stars struggled to break down their dogged opponents until Yosef sliced a dangerous cross from Otieno past his own keeper with five minutes left to play, gifting the Kenyan teenagers an easy path into Saturday's final at Fufa Technical Centre in Njéru. The final will be preceded by the third-place playoff pitting losing semi-finalists Eritrea and Sudan. Meanwhile, JS Kabylie forward Masud Juma has withdrawn from the Harambee Stars squad set to face Mozambique in an international friendly match mid this month. Masud picked up a knee injury in his last league match and has since been replaced by Ulinzi stars forward Enosh Ochieng, who played a part in Kenya’s CHAN Qualifier against Tanzania, as well as the friendly match against Uganda. Coach Francis  Kimanzi had earlier this week named the squad for the match set be played on October 13 at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The team report to camp on Monday. Enosh, who won the KPL Golden Boot last season has been knocking on the Stars' door for the last two years and his belated inclusion gives him another opportunity to stake a claim as a national team regular.
