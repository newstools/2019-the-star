The government has said efforts to retrieve the bodies of Mariam Kigenda and her daughter Amanda Mutheu from the Indian Ocean will be concluded on Friday. Government spokesman Cyrus Oguna on Friday said the elite Kenya Navy teams are doing all they can at the Likoni channel to retrieve the bodies. The operation was expected to be closed on Thursday, but Oguna said strong underwater currents made it difficult for the wreckage of the car to be pulled out. "Ferry operations may be stopped if necessary to pave way for the recovery team to pull the plunged vehicle from the ocean," he said. Friday marked the twelfth day since Kigenda's car plunged in the ocean. The family hired two divers from South Africa to assist in the search and retrieval operation. After 11 days, the government announced the car had been spotted 58 meters deep in the ocean.
