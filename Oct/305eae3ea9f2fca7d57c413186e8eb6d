 Degraded landscapes are slowing the attainment of sustainable development goals, experts have warned. UN experts in a report 'Land Restoration for Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals', said restoring the landscapes are crucial in accelerating the attainment of SDGs. "Land restoration has tremendous potential to help the world limit climate change and achieve its aims for sustainable development," the International Resource Panel said. The report was released on September 5 in New Delhi, India during the 14th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. Kenya targets to restore 5.1 million acres of degraded and deforested lands by 2030, as a contribution to the African Forest and Landscape Restoration initiative, a pan African, country-led effort to restore 100 million acres of deforested and degraded landscape. This will also be Kenya’s contribution to the Bonn Challenge and the New York declaration on forests. The African Forest and Landscape Restoration Initiative aims to restore 100 million hectares of deforested and degraded landscape, the Bonn challenge and the New York Declaration seeks to restore 150 million acres by 2020 and 350 million acres by 2030. Already, Kenya has plans to increase forest cover from the current 7.2 per cent to at least 10 per cent by 2022. UNEP executive director Inger Andersen said a huge step-up is required on all fronts if the world is to achieve sustainable development and reverse the climate and nature crises. "It is time for innovation, holistic thinking and ambitious action to put us on the path to sustainability.” SDGs are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. The UN panel explored the extent to which land restoration helps to achieve other SDGs. They found out that the extent of restoration co-benefits, and potential risks and trade-offs, varies widely among the goals and their respective targets.
