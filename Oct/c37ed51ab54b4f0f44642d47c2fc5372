Sofapaka coach Divaldo Alves has challenged his players to be more clinical in front of goal if they are to be considered as  Kenyan Premier League title contenders. The tactician decried the lack of goals despite the team getting many chances especially in the first half in their clash against Bandari. “We have had so many chances to score and if we had converted them in the first half, we would have been better and the result definitely would have been different. This is one of the things we need to do right. We have to ensure that we get chances and score. That is what we should do more as the season progresses," Divaldo said. After five matches, Batoto Ba Mungu have seven points and are five adrift of the top. “We definitely don’t want to see the gap growing and it will be important for us to get three points," coach Alves said. Alves revealed he is optimistic though that the players will rise to the occasion and take their challenges head-on. Sofapaka have won twice, against Bandari and  Chemelil and drawn once, against Ulinzi Stars. Skipper George Maelo echoed the sentiments of his coach in relation to the number of chances Sofapaka are not putting away. “So far we have had a good first half but in the second half things have not been okay. As the defence, we have not been quick enough in reacting to second balls a We also create so many chances but do not finish,” Maelo said. “These are some of the things we are working on in training and I believe everyone is focused for our next match,” he added. Maelo has called on his teammates to put in a shift for the remainder of the first leg and avoid making the same mistakes they did at the start of last season, which led to a wide gap in the standings after just seven games. Sofapaka are still without  Brian Magonya and Mohammed Kilume as they prepare to face Nzoia United on October 19.
