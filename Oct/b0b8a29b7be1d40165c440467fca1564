Mandera residents will now be included in the running of health services through boards. This emerged on Tuesday after the county assembly passed the Health Service Bill. Two-thirds of the MCAs backed the bill, which will help in sealing off the gaps in the health system. Speaking to the press on the sidelines of the assembly session, Rhamu MCA Qula Alio, who tabled the bill, thanked his colleagues for the support. It provides that level-5 hospitals stock enough drugs and have scanning equipment. Under the new arrangement, the Mandera Referral and Elwak Subcounty hospitals will acquire full-fledged level-5 status. Emergency services will now be given by public and private facilities to all patients without payment. A medic who fails to attend to an emergency will be fined Sh1 million, serve a one-year jail sentence, or be subjected to both. In two years, the county is expected to roll out specialised treatment units in all the health facilities to bridge the big gap between the rich and the poor. The health department will put up CT-scan machines and renal and mental units in the level five hospitals to minimise costs of specialised care. The county has invested significantly in the health sector, with the department getting 20 per cent of its budget. Two months ago, Governor Ali Roba launched the first-ever renal unit and flagged off county ambulances. He said the county will continue allocating more funds for health. A few residents could afford care from private hospitals. Many would instead travel by road for days to access medical service from public facilities. "We all know how the health sector in Mandera was in a mess before devolution. Residents struggled to get proper healthcare at local facilities. We have since managed to address the situation,” he said. Health Executive Mohamed Eda, in a separate interview, said the county has increased the number of health workers from 150 to 950.
