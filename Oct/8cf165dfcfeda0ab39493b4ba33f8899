The three men entered Jacaranda Hotel, Nairobi at 12 noon on October 8. Amos Samaradi had promised to treat his two friends to lunch. They chose a table, perused the menu and ordered food soon after. Then they had drinks and cigarettes. Later, Samaradi asked to swim at the hotel's pool. He was told it would cost him another Sh1,000, and he agreed to pay. But after swimming until 6pm, he told the hotel supervisor Elly Okayo that he was unable to pay the Sh10,000 bill because he was bankrupt. He became rude and arrogant to the hotel management and was arrested and booked at the Parklands Police Station. His friends were let go because he had committed to paying the bill. On Friday, he was charged at a Kibera court for obtaining credit by false pretences. He pleaded guilty to the charges before Kibera senior resident magistrate Boaz Ombewa. Hotel supervisor Okayo and another witness Geoffrey Muinde told police about the events leading up to Samaradi's arrest. “They enjoyed [themselves] a lot in our facility but Samaradi was the one to pay for the rest declined to do so,” Okayo told the police in court documents. “The accused person is a fast time offender, he has no other criminal records, he was rude and arrogant when he was approached to pay the bill and he was arrested and booked at the Parklands police station for the offence,” the prosecution said. On his mitigation, Samaradi said that the bill was to be paid as a team. He said that he was ready to pay the bill and requested forgiveness. Ombewa directed that Samaradi be remanded at Parklands Police Station and a probation report on the same be filed in court. The matter will be mentioned on October 16. (edited by O. Owino)
