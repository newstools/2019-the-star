Four Nairobi MCAs were on Tuesday thrown out of the chambers for unruly behaviour which caused drama in the House. The MCAs, led by Nominated MCA Mary Njambi alias 'mafirifiri', former city mayor and Baba Dogo MCA Godfrey Majiwa, nominated MCA Leah Supuko and Kware Ward MCA Rose Kula were engaged in a shouting match, which had interrupted the House proceedings. They left the chambers following instructions by acting County Assembly Speaker Chege Mwaura. It all started when Majority leader Abdi Hassan Guyo raised an issue on the floor concerning the embattled Nairobi Speaker Beatrice Elachi who had publicly said in Kibra on Sunday that she was impeached after the MCAs were influenced by the Deputy President to do so. Umoja Two MCA Joseph Ndonji rose on a point of order and criticised Guyo, saying that he should not bring Jubilee Party issues to the house. “Mr Speaker, why is the honourable member bringing in party issues on the floor? Such party issues should be discussed at the party houses,” he said. At this juncture, all hell broke loose as the Jubilee and ODM MCAs engaged in a back and forth shouting match, throwing words at each other. Defending the Majority Leader, nominated MCA Leah Supuko said that Guyo was right to discuss any matter on the floor if given a green light by the speaker. Her statement triggered Majiwa, who took her head on and told her to “go slowly” and stop supporting the discussion of party matters at the assembly. His ODM counterpart, Rose Kula supported him turning down the Jubilee nominated MCA saying “even those who have not been elected now have a voice here." Her statement further triggered nominated MCA Njambi which made her shout “msituletee Jubilee ndo tuko wengi hapa. (Don't bother us yet Jubilee is the majority here)." After close to 10 minutes of the free-for-all drama, Mwaura directed the serjeant-at-arms to lead the four members out of the plenary for the remainder of the sitting.
