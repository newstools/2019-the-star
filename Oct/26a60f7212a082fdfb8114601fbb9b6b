THE TUSKER OKTOBAFEST From the all-time Kenyan classics to gengetone, there’s quite a lot to enjoy in Nairobi this weekend. The true experience of the Kenyan culture comes alive at THE TUSKER OKTOBAFEST on October 5 to October 6 as Kenya Breweries LTD (KBL) presents the biggest beer festival in Kenya. The two-day event showcase to be held at the Ngong Racecourse is expected to be the biggest musical, arts and dance showcase featuring an all Kenyan lineup. There will be two main stages and over 35 Kenyan artistes set to perform. Some of the artistes on the line-up include Khaligraph Jones, Nyashinski, Sauti Sol, Ethic, Jua Cali, Fena, Bensoul, Nadia Mukami, Sailors, Hart the Band, Karun and more. Truly, this is “the only place to beer.” TOO MANY FACES? Exhibit 'Too many faces?' Is a portrait centred art exhibition by Ibrahim Ndungu (Ebruh) and Allan Kioko (Think) both of the graffiti collective Bomb Squad Crew (BSQ). The show is an exploration and celebration of the distinct African facial features, emotions and expressions that clearly haven't been portrayed enough in the art world. The show also challenges the "we have seen enough portraits" ignorant statements by the so called  'art institutions' and 'critics' hence the rhetoric title 'TOO MANY FACES?.' The exhibit opens on October 5 at the BSQ studios at the Nairobi Railway Museum from 9 am to 5 pm. It runs until November 5. Kata Kata Looking for something to set the mood for the upcoming week?
