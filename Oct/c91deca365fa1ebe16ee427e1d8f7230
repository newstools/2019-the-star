An MCA wants the Taita Taveta county government compelled to compensate families whose relatives died during the health workers' strike. Christopher Mwambingu (nominated) told the Star that more than 30 people may have died in the two-week strike in August. He accused the Health department of negligence. “The government should learn to protect lives by streamlining its systems. How could simple issues of payment and deductions end up in a longer than 10-day strike?” Mwambingu asked. He said he would go to court to press for the compensation. The workers went on strike a fortnight ago citing delayed salaries, non-remittance of statutory deductions and delayed promotions. Mwambingu cited the case of a patient whom, he said, died after being discharged — before she was treated at Taveta Hospital — due to the strike. The MCA said he was compiling the list of victims of the strike. “We are finding out the exact number of those who died as a result of the strike before making our next move,” he said. Mata MCA Nobert Chanzu said many hospitals lacked essential drugs and medical equipment due to a large debt to the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency, which has suspended supplies. He said many health centres lacked basic equipment tools and seldom received pharmaceutical supplies, making it difficult to provide better services. “The county has been marked as a bad debtor for not paying Kemsa on time. We urge the governor to swiftly intervene to ensure that supplies are restored,”  Chanzu said. However, Health Services executive Daniel Makoko said the agency has not blacklisted the county. He did not disclose the outstanding debt though some estimates place it at about Sh70 million. "Some of our facilities have received drugs and others will receive them in due course. We are also making arrangements to pay the debt," he said. Edited by R.Wamochie
