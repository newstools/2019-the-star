Even before the National Police Service Commission investigates why cases of suicide among police officers have increased, it should seek answers as to whether the officers are mistreated or unhappy at work. Lately, the number of suicides being reported in the service could mean that a good number of our officers are suffering in silence yet no one is in the know. Some junior officers have decried mistreatment on social media. NPSC should provide psychiatric support to their members regularly.Â Cops should also open up on matters affecting them.  Nairobi
