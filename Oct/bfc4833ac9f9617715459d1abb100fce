Promising Ugandan artist Mowzey Radio, real name Moses Sekibooga, died in February last year after he was injured in a bar altercation Ten days before his death, Radio was attacked by a bouncer at a nightclub called De Bar and went into a coma. Speaking about the assault, Pamela Musimire said there was an altercation. “When George stood up, producer Washington grabbed him thinking they were going to fight. I grabbed Radio to lead him out of the bar since both of them had turned rowdy,” she said. “As we were going out, some other guy came out of nowhere, lifted Radio up and threw him to the ground and he lost consciousness.” On Monday the High Court in Entebbe found the bouncer, Godfrey Wamala, aka Troy, guilty of manslaughter and but not of murder. The prosecution produced nine witnesses, including Radio’s mother Jane Kasuubo and Washington. Washington testified that he was with Radio and saw him pour wine on other patrons which annoyed Troy, who then hit him. The charge of manslaughter attracts a maximum penalty of life imprisonment in Uganda. Troy will be sentenced on Thursday.
