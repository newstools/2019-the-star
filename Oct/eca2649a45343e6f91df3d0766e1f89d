A high noon is anticipated as the Two Wheel Drive Turbo category in the KCB Autocross 10 goes down to the wire at Mombasa Cement factory racetrack in Vipingo on October 13. Kunal Patel who is leading the category with 171 points will be engaged in a protracted battle with his closest challenger, Shalien Mughal who has 164 points. Although seven points adrift off the top, Shalien expressed optimism of upsetting the applecart. “Preparations are going quite on point but I have a lot to do as I had crashed my buggy from the front. I am working round the clock to get it up and running. We are going to fight for the title until the last minute,” said Shalien. “Even though it’s a slim chance, the strategy is quite simple; give it our best on the day and hopefully hope to win. For us to beat Kunal for the title, we will have to win and hope he finishes third or below.” On his part, Kunal says he is expecting another close battle with Mughal in a rivalry that has elicited a lot of interest among fans. Kunal hopes his buggy will be in tip-top shape for the sea level extravaganza. “The buggy is still not ready after the Hill Climb; hopefully we can get it ready in time. I’m looking forward to a strong finish in Vipingo,” said Kunal.
