Embattled Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja has snubbed an invitation by a Senate committee probing his impeachment. The governor was invited to appear before the special committee to defend himself against allegations levelled against him by the MCAs in impeaching him. Instead, the county chief sent his lawyer Nelson Havi who said his client is not in a position to appear on the strength of a court order stopping the Senate from probing his ouster. Havi, in his preliminary objection, faulted the Senate for proceeding with the probe despite Court order. He says the order was served on the clerk stopping the house from investigations the grounds raised by the MCAs. Havi also said the Senate would be violating its own standing orders No. 98 (2) that bars the House from transacting a matter before a court of law. He further says that the governor had not been served by allegations levelled against him and therefore he could not file a response to the committees. "In light of these issues, the prudent thing for the Senate to do is to stay proceedings until the petition is concluded, " Havi told the committee. The committee adjourned to consult after Havi's submission. The county assembly is being represented by lawyer Charles Njenga. In the charges read in the committee, the MCAs have listed six grounds for impeachment the county chief. They accuse him of gross misconduct and violating several laws including the Constitution.
