The root cause for the Silverstone plane's wheel falling off was due to a bearing failure, the airline has confirmed. One of the Silverstone's plane made an emergency landing at the Eldoret International Airport on Monday after one of its tyres came off. The plane was en-route from Lodwar to Nairobi. There were no causalities. "This was not an emergency landing. The aircraft was inspected, certified and released back to service," the airline said in a statement on Wednesday. According to them, one of their aircraft Dash 8-300 registration 5Y-BWG lost the number three main wheel assembly on take off from Lodwar. "The aircraft was diverted to Eldoret Airport as a safety precaution and the pilot in command landed safely," it said. The airline noted that there was another Fokker aircraft that had a ramp incident at the Wilson airport. This was a ramp incident that occurred on Fokker 50 registration 5Y-SMT. The aircraft clipped a beech-craft King Air 200 registration as 5Y-SSB registered to East African Safari Air Express Limited "Our aircraft was taxing for engine runs.Â  The aircraft was not taking off for a flight as widely reported but was going for a routine engine ground runs for purposes of maintenance," they said. "Wilson airport ramp is congested with active and disabled aircraft. This incident was reported to the relevant authorities and our insurers are in contact with the insurers of the affected airline." On Tuesday, MPs summoned Silverstone Air managers following two recent accidents involving their passenger aircraft. The airline has been on the spot following the two incidents during takeoff, raising concerns about the safety of its planes.
