Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua wants all churches and other religious organisations to return the money they have received from politicians. Mutua says this move will serve as a good example in taming corruption in churches. “It will be a wakeup call to Kenyans if somebody goes to a church and gives money and the father says, 'Sorry we do not need your money take it back.” His statement comes after the Anglican and Catholic churches banned priests and bishops from receiving money in churches and allowing politicking from pulpits and at funerals. For accountability, they have agreed on only receiving electronic money and cheques. Anglican Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit said some politicians are misleading Christians by citing wrong Bible verses and "trying to force the scriptures to say what they want". Sapit has warned that no donor will be allowed to give his money to the church openly. Mutua commended the Catholic Church for coming out and saying churches should fully commit themselves to prayer. But he wants more than just prayers. “Prayer is not enough. We also have to have action. It does not matter if we pray and pray as churches receive money whose sources are questionable, yet at the back of our minds, we know that money is stolen. I call upon the Catholic Church to continue what they are doing and to take it one step further,” the county chief said. He requested churches to hold special prayers and sermons for voters, saying they need to be enlightened that the fate of their lives lies not only in prayer but their choice at the ballot. “Young men and women who are unemployed and have families find it hard to survive due to a slowdown of the economy as a result of corruption. They should be encouraged not to vote for known criminals — killers, thieves and people with no development record.” Edited by R.Wamochie
