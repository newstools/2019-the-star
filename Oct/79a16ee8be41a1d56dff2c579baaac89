Tucked away inside the Naivasha Flower Business Park, Mwanzo Lodge is a home away from home. Companies, including Panda, are found at the park. The lodge is in a quiet residential area located on a hill overlooking the spectacular views around Lake Naivasha.   The lodge has a number of types of accommodation, with a total of 18 rooms, of which three are one-bedroom apartments. There's also a campsite with 15 tents. Most rooms include a privet balcony with beautiful views, a television set and a tea or coffee station and free Wi-Fi. There's also a swimming pool and outside seating, where guests can take meals, read a book or have a drink. Guests can go out and explore the area using bikes for hire, and lodge staffers can take you for a tour of flower farms for free. The lodge also offers cooking classes on how to prepare local cuisine. The lodge has partnered with the Naivasha Children’s Shelter, where rescued street boys get an education and an opportunity to learn life skills. Naivasha is home to one of Kenya’s largest export industries – the flower business. Kenyan roses command about 40 per cent of the market share in the EU. Contact 0715885540 for more information.
