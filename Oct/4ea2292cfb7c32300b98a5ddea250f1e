Jose Chameleone has called upon the police to investigate and find out about a person who has been threatening to kill him via text messages. He wrote on Facebook, "I have been receiving threats. This person calling himself General, I first received a message on the 10th September, they demanded for 5Million Or I get killed. "I ignored the requests and just again today, they are back asking me to send mobile money of 8Million shillings. I already made my police reports and hope the Uganda Police and security can apprehend such goons that are getting at large. "We have had a lot of killings and I am not carrying this lightly. Whosoever is behind this. The public and authority are now aware" This comes after another Ugandan singer, Bebe Cool, accused another contact of plotting to harm his family.
