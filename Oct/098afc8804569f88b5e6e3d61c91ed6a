Safaricom will change their M-Pesa logo for the next seven days to show their loyalty and support for World marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge. "It's great honour for Safaricom to be associated with this great man Eliud Kipchoge" acting CEO Michael Joseph said on Wednesday. "It is an immense honour and privilege to have the opportunity to dedicate our iconic M-PESA brand in honour of a befitting icon." The new logo will be the five letters spelling Kipchoge’s first name, “Eliud” and the numbers “1:59” to denote the challenge. Joseph said it was a super-human fete that takes great talent and effort to even accomplish. "In this regard, we will be going beyond having Kipchoge as our ambassador; Equally, Safaricom will also become Eliud Kipchoge ’s ambassador," he said. Kipchoge began his first day in Vienna by running on the challenge course with several of his pacemakers. Kipchoge who arrived in Vienna on Tuesday was seen beginning his race-week preparations ahead of the #INEOS159 Challenge. He left for Vienna aboard Sir Jim’s Gulfstream G280, which was flown by two pilots from his British base to fly Kipchoge to the Austrian capital.
