A court in Oyugis has sentenced a 40-year-old man to life imprisonment for defiling a 10-year-old girl. Wilfred Kibeti pleaded guilty to the offence allegedly committed in Kasipul constituency. According to court documents, Kibeti committed the offence on diverse dates between October 19 and October 20. Senior resident magistrate Celesa Okore found Kibeti guilty of intentionally and unlawfully defiling a minor against section 8(1) and (4) of the Sexual Offences Act. On a second count, Kibeti was charged with intentionally touching a minorâ€™s private body parts contrary to the Sexual Offences Act. Kibeti asked the court for leniency. The magistrate ruled that the offence was serious, and a medical report from a hospital had proved that the convict defiled the minor. Kibeti was given 14 days to appeal the life sentence.
