A GSU officer linked to the killing of a mother and her daughter in Katani, Machakos, has confessed to the double murder. Anthony Kilonzo appeared in court on Thursday and said he decided to confess to killing businesswoman Purity Wanjiru, 35, and her mother Anne Gatiti, 60, after interrogation. "I was approached by a friend to go help do the job of killing the woman," he said. However, magistrate Muthoni Nzibe stopped him from going on with the confession, saying he needed a lawyer. The court has directed him to be detained at Kilimani police station for 21 days. The magistrate has also directed that he be taken for mental assessment. Kilonzo was among four people arrested in connection with the double murder in Mlolongo. On Wednesday, police killed a suspected thug believed to be linked to the murders on Saturday night. They surrounded his house and stormed it, leading to a shootout after he fired first, they said. The killings at the upscale homestead were carefully planned, not a case of robbery with violence, police suspect. Wanjiru and Gatiti were shot in the head with rifles. Wanjiru and her husband were in their car, her mother opened the gate. Wanjiru's husband, Frederick Mwangi, was shot in the arm and leg and hospitalised. Her sister-in-law was hospitalised with bruises. DCI Director of Operations Danson Diru told reporters on Wednesday that 26-year-old Gibson Nyabaga was shot dead at his parentsâ€™ homestead at about 7.30am. It's 800 metres from the double murder scene. Two AK-47 rifles were recovered, one from Nyabaga, the other from an accomplice who escaped. Diru said. Police also recovered face masks, caps and other items.
