Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has condemned panga attacks allegedly targeting members of the Kamba community living in Igembe South, Meru county. Kalonzo said the violence has no place in a  modern society and urged authorities  to act fast and end what appeared to be land clashes. Kalonzo said he saved the life of a teacher who had been seriously injured in a panga assault by getting him moved to Mwingi Level 4 hospital for medical treatment. The politician spoke at a public meeting in Tseikuru, Mwnigi North subcounty, on Tuesday. “I condemn what is happening in Igembe South in Meru. I had to transport Mwalimu Kavita in the night to Mwingi hospital following panga injuries. We don’t want to see people attacking others,” said Kalonzo. The former Mwingi North MP said the Constitution gives every Kenyan the right to live in any part of the county. He said Kambas who went to Igembe to do business should be allowed to live in peace. “I have already raised the matter with Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi and the Inspector General of Police Hilary Mutyambai because the attacks are unacceptable. They must be stopped at whatever cost,” Kalonzo said. He said Kiraitu promised everything was being done to stop the attacks. “We want any persons out to cause land clashes in Meru to be arrested and made to face the law,” he said. He was in company of the Mwingi North MP Paul Nzengu, Tseikuru MCA Boniface Kilaa and deputy county police commander Ann Mitema.
