A Form 3 student who had been reported missing from Lamu Girls High School on Saturday has been found. Mercy Wairimu, 17, showed up at her parents’ home in Heshima village in Mpeketoni on Wednesday morning accompanied by a relative. She sneaked out during a blackout at the school and went to her boyfriend’s place in Kashmir area in Lamu town. County commissioner Irungu Macharia said that the girl's parents had since recorded a statement at the Lamu police station. Macharia said the girl told police that she ran away from school following frustrations by one of the teachers who claimed she had cheated during the end of third term exams. Once out of school, the girl told police she borrowed a phone which she used to call her boyfriend who picked her up but encouraged her to go back home the following day. “She says the teacher threatened to expose her for cheating and so to avoid any repercussions, she sneaked out of school. She called her boyfriend at around 10pm who then encouraged her to go home to Mpeketoni the following day,” Macharia said. The girl arrived at her home in Mpeketoni on Sunday but out of fear of her parents went to a relative's place. Macharia said investigations are underway. The boyfriend has since recorded a statement with Lamu police. The girl’s mother Margaret Njeri said they had gone back to school but had been turned back. They were told to await the decision of the school’s board of management on the girl’s fate next term. “We now wait for next year and see what the board decides. I pray they forgive my daughter and allow her to complete her studies there,” Njeri said. (edited by O. Owino)
