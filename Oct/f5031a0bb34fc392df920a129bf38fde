The High Court has restrained the Senate from deliberating or continuing with the impeachment of Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja. Justice Weldon Korir granted the order on Thursday, pending hearing and determination of a fresh application filed by Samboja. Last Friday, the High Court issued orders staying the resolution of the county assembly recommending the Senate impeach Samboja. Samboja, through lawyer Nelson Havi, said the orders were served to the Senate on Monday and it acknowledged receipt by stamping on the Court Order. But despite the orders, Samboja said the Senate convened, debated and passed a resolution appointing 11 members to a select committee to hear and file a report on whether he should be impeached within 10 days. Samboja was impeached by a unanimous decision of the county assembly. All the 30 MCAs were present in the House supported the impeachment motion. The motion was moved by Deputy Majority Leader Harris Keke. Keke claimed the governor grossly violated the law by misappropriating public funds and inciting the public against the assembly. Samboja is the fifth governor to be impeached by their county assemblies. Embu governor Martin Wambora has been impeached twice by the county assembly and the decision held by the Senate. The impeachment was however overturned by court. Governors Paul Chepkuony (Kericho), Mwangi Wairia (Muranga), the late Nderitu Gachagua (Nyeri) were all impeached by the assemblies, but the decisions were overturned by the Senate.
