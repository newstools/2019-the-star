For the umpteenth time, the Senate has questioned the whereabouts of West Pokot Deputy Governor Nicholas Atudonyang. Atudonyang is a neurosurgeon practising in Texas in the US where he has been since he was sworn in more than two years ago. The Deputy Governor has been in the county for less than one month and his boss, Governor John Lonyangapuo, doesn't seem in the least bothered. In fact, Lonyangapuo has been defending Atudonyang’s absence, claiming he does not earn a salary and is busy looking for medical investors in the US. The governor forgets that he and his absentee Number Two took an oath of office to serve the people of West Pokot together. This state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue because Atudonyang’s absence violates the Constitution and is morally wrong. It amounts to gross misconduct and contempt of the people who elected him. Article 181 of the Constitution is clear on the grounds upon which a governor and or his deputy can be removed from office. They also include physical inability to serve in office. Atudonyang must relinquish the position if he can’t stay in Kenya and work for the Pokot people. If he can’t or won't resign, he should be impeached.
