Detectives from the Directorate of the Criminal Investigations have nabbed a suspected linked to Mpesa theft. Robert Mwaura Mwita is linked to various cases of Mpesa fraud in which members of the public have been defrauded millions of shillings. He was arrested yesterday by the DCI sleuths after an assiduous operation. According to the DCI, the suspect has been working in cahoot with security guards manning various ATMs to con unsuspecting members of the public. He is said to have recruited the guards whose work is to withdraw money after sending them withdrawal secret codes. “Upon withdrawing the money conned from unsuspecting members of the public, the said guards have been taking their agreed upon portion & sending the rest to Mwaura, the prime suspect,” the DCI said on their twitter handle. The department said the detectives through intelligence were able to nab one of the suspects in the act (as shown in the videos) who later led them to the prime suspect. “Further investigations showed that the two guards Stanley Nyakundi and Godfrey Masinde Simiyu had in the month of September alone, sent over Ksh. 2.2 Million to the prime suspect, Robert Mwaura Mwita,”the DCI said. The suspects are in lawful custody and will be arraigned on Tuesday to answer to appropriate charges. There has been a public outcry over increasing cases of sim swap fraud. Last year Safaricom warned its subscribers to ensure that their personal information is well secured.
