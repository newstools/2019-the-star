Andrew Kanuli marked his return to Shabana with a narrow 1-0 win over Coast Stima as the home side maintained their unbeaten record at Gusii Stadium. “This was a very important win for me and the boys. We now must build on this as we prepare to play Eldoret Youth next weekend. We also kept a clean sheet which is good. Our away record is wanting but we want to reverse that trend,” said the youthful tactician. Shabana have only won one away game, beating  Modern Coast Rangers 3-2  and held Vihiga Bullets to a barren draw. Kanuli said they would have won Saturday's game by four goals and differed with Coast Stima coach Paul Ogai assertion that the referee wanted to be the man of the match. “Coast Stima had their chances which they failed to utilise. We got ours and converted as early as the 10th minute and held on to win. We missed three clear cut chances in this game. On officiating, it was fair because I also questioned some calls. Today, luck was on our side,” Kanuli added. Kanuli took over the team last Monday, replacing Gilbert Selebwa who resigned two weeks ago. Abou Traore scored the lone goal after he was put through by winger Dennis Onyancha as Shabana ended Coast Stima’s four-game unbeaten run. The power men picked 10 out of the possible 12 points from the last four matches. Ogai, however, said his team played well adding that they are headed in the right direction. “This is a small setback but we shall pick ourselves up and bounce back against Vihiga Bullets next weekend at home. Comparing to where we were at the beginning of the season, we are on the right track,” added Ogai. He praised Shabana saying despite financial challenges, they played their hearts out. “Shabana are now under a coach who understands their culture. I wish them well in the league. Despite their problems, they have a good team,” said the former Western Stima coach.
