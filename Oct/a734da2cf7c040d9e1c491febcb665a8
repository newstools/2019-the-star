A man serving a life sentence for killing his girlfriend in 2012 wants the sentence quashed, arguing that he was a minor when he committed the crime. Maxwell Munene Maina, 28, told a Mombasa court that he regrets killing her and asked to be set free "to achieve his dreams". "I have served seven years in jail. I am a reformed man and willing to reunite with the community," Munene said. He is at Manyani Maximum Prison. He said he is unmarried and the only son in a family of two. The parents died while he was in jail. Munene was 16 when he murdered his 15-year-old girlfriend in November 2012 at Kautha in Lamu's Hindi division. He argued that he was supposed to be jailed in a juvenile institution for three years as per the Children's Act. The girl's body was found naked, face down, where Munene lived, a day after she was reported missing. She had been sexually molested and had severe injuries on her private parts. Her neck was broken. The cause of death was established as cardio-respiratory arrest. DNA analysis confirmed that the deceased and Muneneâ€™s swabs matched with their blood samples. Senior prosecution counsel David Fedha opposed the release of the appellant and requested the court to impose a sentence of 45 years. "The appellant killed a young girl and he should serve as an example," Fedha said. Justice Erick Ogola told Munene to convince the court why his sentence should be reduced. The court heard that Munene had borrowed a spade from the girl's parents at noon and returned it at 6pm, moments before they noticed she was missing. Munene denied seeing the minor although there was a blood-stained mattress in his house. When the court tried to find out whether he had tried to contact the family of the deceased, he said he was not in a position to reach them. Judgment will be delivered next year on February 6.
