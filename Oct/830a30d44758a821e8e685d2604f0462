A man has told the court that officers from Lang’ata police station inserted his head under the table and seriously caned his buttocks as  videos of the same were taken by complaints Paul Ojonga told Kibera senior resident magistrate Barbara Ojoo that the beatings were so severe. “My honour, my head was inserted under the table and some beatings mounted on me, they instructed me to tell them the truth concerning some amounts of money alleged to have been stolen. I was told not to move my body, but I had to move for me to speak clearly but the more I moved my body the more I was beaten up by police,” he told the court. He said he suffered in the hands of the police and those recording it. He said one of the witnesses who was testifying against him was the recorder of the incident. “She is the one who was laughing and recording me as I was badly assaulted, the police allowed her to record,” he added. The witness confirmed to the court that she took the recordings after the accused person posed a question to her. The witness said she only took the audio recordings but not the video as alleged. He also told the court that he was a father of three and said that the police in Industrial Area have made it difficult for his family to pay him a visit. “Kindly assist me, because one of my child will be an engineer, the other will be an accountant and the last born is set to be a DJ,” he said. The magistrate advised him to use the prison leadership to launch the complaint for him to get assistance. According to the charge sheet, Ojonga is charged with colluding with his fiancée Sarah Sibo to steal $3000 from Kashmirahben Kirahim Kumar on diverse dates in July at Nairobi West, Kosi Road. Ojoo directed the matter to precede father on October 27. (Edited by V. Graham)
