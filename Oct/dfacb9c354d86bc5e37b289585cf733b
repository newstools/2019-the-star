I feel more ready and prepared, a confident Eliud Kipchoge has told the world ahead of his race on Saturday. "I am confident because I have been there before. All kilometers in the race are critical and I treat all the distance I will run as critical," the world marathon record holder said. Kipchoge will be attempting to clock the tape in under two hours in the 42 kilometers race dubbed Ineos 1:59 challenge. He seeks to shatter his own record set last year at the Berlin marathon of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds. Addressing a press conference in Vienna on Thursday, Kipchoge said running is like life itself. "I feel well. I am happy with the course and I am waiting for Saturday. Let us not say anything negative but hope that all will be well," he said. Kipchoge said pressure is everywhere in the world adding that no human is limited. "I am trying to stay as calm as possible. This means a lot to my country because its telling people that human can be beyond limit," he said. Noting that he gets support from all over the world, Kipchoge said to run in Berlin and Vienna are different. "The Berlin marathon was breaking a world record while Vienna is making history and its like going to the moon. And this is not my last marathon," he said. Kipchoge's iconic target of running the distance under two hours, dubbed “INEOS 1:59 Challenge”, will take place in the streets of Vienna. Kipchoge landed in Vienna on Tuesday morning boarding a private jet owned by Sir Jim’s Gulfstream G280. Deputy President William Ruto and Special AU envoy Raila Odinga led Kenyans in wishing Kipchoge success in his upcoming attempt. Through hash tags #Eliudkipchoge, #Ineos 1:59 Challenge and #Eliudkipchoge challenge, Kenyans passed messages of success towards Kipchoge.
