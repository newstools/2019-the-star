A woman and her young daughter, while in their vehicle, slid off a moving ferry on Sunday evening. The car sank. They are presumed dead. Kenya Ferry Service is a parastatal whose mandate is to transport consumers and ensure their safety. In this day and age, in the city hosting the Kenya Navy, it is disturbing no effort to retrieve the car and its occupants has started. KFS is replete with deadly mishaps. Parastatal bosses have not bothered to explain why the ramp was not pulled up to block the car from sinking into deep ocean. It is obvious from Sunday's disaster that KFS is still shockingly unprepared to deal with a horrendous accident. To make matters worse, communications and marketing staff posted information creating the impression that they were either unaware of the accident or didn't think it was a disaster that shocked the nation. Instead of remorse, condolences — and action — the PR team was busy releasing information about the number of ferries rolled out for the day. Only in July, a driver and his loader escaped unhurt after their truck plunged into the Indian Ocean during disembarking. KFS's incompetence resulting in the avoidable accident is unacceptable. So is its insensitivity. Quote of the Day: “I would be a fool to deny my own abilities.” Dame Julie Andrews The English actress was born on October 1, 1935
