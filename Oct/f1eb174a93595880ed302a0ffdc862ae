At least two people were killed on Sunday night in renewed violence between warring factions in Lolgorian, Transmara West in Narok county. Police are interrogating six people in connection with the chaos pitying morans from Siria and Uasin Gishu clans. The killings stirred up protests in Kilgoris on Monday with residents decrying deteriorating security. At least 30 protesters were briefly detained before being released. They said more people might be killed if the government fails to act quickly. The two groups are fighting over the demarcation of the Nkaararo-Enosaen border. The two decades-plus conflict has left dozens injured and displaced many from their land. Some youths have been shot by police sent to quell tension. On Monday, more than three hundred protesters, mainly women,Â  turned up in Kilgoris to petition the government to end the skirmishes. They especially asked the security agencies to increase surveillance in the troubled region to stem the fracas. Transmara West deputy county commissioner Hassan Noor said a combined team of GSU, Anti-Stock Unit and the regular police has been deployed to the area. "We are doing everything to ensure this border issue is dealt with so as to allow people to return to their farms," Noor said. He said the bodies were taken to Kilgoris Subcounty Hospital Mortuary. "Those arrested will be arraigned tomorrow (today) if there is sufficient evidence," Noor said. He said a team of surveyors from Nairobi had begun mapping the contested site to end the conflict. "We are actually awaiting a report from them this week. We hope if implemented, the report will end the bickering between the two sides."
