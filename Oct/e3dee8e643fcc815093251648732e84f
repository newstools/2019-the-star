Philemon Rono will be chasing his third Toronto Waterfront Marathon title this Sunday in the Canadian capital. Rono failed to clinch a hat trick of titles last year when he finished ninth in a race won by debutant Benson Kipruto. The runner, who paced for Wilson Kipsang when he broke the world marathon record in Berlin in 2014, said he was well prepared for the race. “I am going to Toronto to run a better race and I hope to recapture my title. Last year, it was bad for me,” said Rono who last year won Kaptagat Forest Half Marathon. Rono who is popularly known as 'Junior Police' because of his height, added: “I have had good preparations and I hope to run well this time around." He hoted: " I expect more challenges because neighbours Uganda have also entered the race after posing a serious challenge last year. However,  that doesn’t bother me much.” The runner holds the Toronto Waterfront Marathon course record of 2:06:52 set in 2017 on his way to a brace. The 28-year-old competed at the 2019 Boston Marathon, finishing sixth (2:08:57) in a race won by Lawrence Cherono, who also won Chicago Marathon on Sunday. Defending champion Kipruto said he will be going for sub-2:06 to better last year's 2:07.24 timing. Following his Toronto exploits last year, he was invited to compete at the 2019 Boston marathon for the first time in April, his major breakthrough in the World Marathon Majors, where he finished 10th. “If I can defend my title, it will be very good for me and my marathon career,” said Kipruto, who trains at 2 Running Club in Kapsabet.
