More than 100 Machakos girls aged 10 from primary schools on Thursday received the cervical cancer jab at Machakos Level 5 Hospital. The vaccination targets to prevent the Human Papilloma Virus which causes cancer of the cervix. According to the Ministry of Health, it is a common infection that has no symptoms. The vaccine, which was launched at the hospital, will be given to all 10-year-old girls for free. It will be given twice every year at an interval of six months for it to be effective and will be available in all public facilities, the ministry said. Speaking during the launch of the HPV vaccine, Health executive Ancent Kituku assured parents the vaccine is 90 per cent effective and has no side effects. He refuted claims from some Catholic leaders who alleged that the vaccine is made for family planning to prevent early pregnancies among school girls. “I am a staunch Catholic and I disagree with some bishops saying that this vaccine can develop problems. Those claims are just pure propaganda. This vaccine is evidence-based medicine; it was tested and we found it’s safe for our children,” Kituku said. He urged parents to make sure all girls aged 10 old are vaccinated. He urged all 2,530 volunteers and community health workers from all 453 units in the county to educate parents on the importance of the jab. However, the vaccine is also available for girls above 10 and adults but it will be given at Sh5,000 per dose in the private sector. A full dose will cost Sh10,000. Public health officer Dr Lucas Mwove urged all women to take advantage of the Machakos Cancer Centre to be screened. Edited by R.Wamochie
