The government has scaled up security along the troubled border between Siria and Uasin Gishu clans in Transmara West, Narok county. A contingent of GSU and regular police officers has been deployed to the region to forestall further raids between the two warring Maasai clans. The deployment follows the break out of a fresh bout of violence on Friday and Saturday night between youths from two clans. Subcounty boss Hassan Noor, however, warned of action against individuals out to create animosity and fan violence between the two clans. He said the government was keen to ensure no candidate is locked out of the ongoing examinations because of the skirmishes. "Our appeal to both clans is to ensure there is peace so that their young ones can do examinations in an atmosphere that is free of tension," Noor said. During the Friday night skirmishes, some youths and a GSU officer are said to have sustained arrow injuries. Noor, however, refuted the reports, saying no person was injured "Those are rumours. No villager nor a member of the security team was injured. We have heard it but that is propaganda as far as we are concerned," he told journalists. Noor said the ongoing demarcation along the contested boundary will continue to the end as it will offer a solution to the ongoing tension and constant flare-ups in the area. Hundreds of villagers living near the contested boundary have been attacked and killed. The father of Citizen journalist StephenÂ  Letoo was killed in the area eight years ago . The two clans have been fighting for more than four decades over the boundary. On Sunday, Noor termed the fightings as senseless, adding that the government has the machine to end them, even as he appealed for calm. "If you look at what they are fighting for, it is absolutely senseless. Surveyors have been sent there and should be allowed to finish their work," he told the Star
