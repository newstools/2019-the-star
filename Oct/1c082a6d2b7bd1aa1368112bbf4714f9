The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority has launched investigations into Silverstone Airlines following two emergency landings by its aircraft in two weeks. A Silverstone plane made an emergency landing at Eldoret International Airport on Monday after one of its tyres came off. The plane was enroute from Lodwar to Nairobi. There were no casualties. In a statement on Monday, KCAA said an audit of the airline was necessary to determine compliance with Civil Aviation regulations. The authority urged the public to remain vigilant and report any cases of concern as it continues to probe the matter. This comes barely two weeks after another Silverstone plane skidded off the runway at Wilson Airport. The plane had 50 passengers on board and two sustained minor injuries. Kenya Airports Authority said it was probing the incident. "The aircraft is carrying out investigations to establish the cause of the incident," KAA said in a statement.
