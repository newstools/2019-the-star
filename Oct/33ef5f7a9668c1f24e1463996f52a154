Tanzanian singer Mbosso says his latest song 'Shilingi' was supposed to be a collabo with Kenyan boy band Sauti Sol. However, he chose to work with Nigerian artiste Reekado Banks. "Before the collabo, I spoke to four artistes. I remember I even texted Rudeboy but Reekadoh told me how he loved my music," he said. "I sent him the song that I was supposed to do with Sauti Sol. They were busy, so when I went to Kenya to shoot the video, I told them that ReekadoÂ  had already done his verse." Mbosso said this during an interview with Tanzanian radio personality Lil Ommy. "Sauti Sol understood and we have another project with them, so expect something big," he said. "It is my first collabo to feature someone since I started working with WCB. Most of the time, I have been featured instead." Apart from Sauti Sol being busy, he says the reason he didn't work with former P-Square member Rudeboy was because of money. "It couldn't be possible because his management asked for a huge amount of money. Reekadoh, on the other hand, didn't even want a coin." Recently, the WCB singer was rumoured to have fired his manager Sandrah over irreconcilable differences. "Music is a business where everyone wants to get a profit. I am a businessman that is under a management (WCB) and they look at my work with a third eye," he explained. "My management thought that the manager I had should have gone from the ordinary and done more work. That is something she lacked but she was a good person. "Right now, I don't have a manager. I am solo but my work is going on well. Yes, I'm looking for a manager and gender is not an issue."
