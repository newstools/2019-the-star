Two children on Monday afternoon died in a house fire in Kipsoen, Bomet East. The children, aged two and three years, were sleeping in the house when the 2pm incident occurred. The mother had gone to a nearby house to collect milk. A neighbour told the Star the mother had locked the two in the house, fearing they might get out. Neighbours said they saw smoke billowing from the house and by the time they managed to put it out, the kids were dead. The cause of the fire has not been established. "We do not know how the fire started, but someone may have had a hand in it," a resident who sought anonymity said. Bomet East subcounty police commander Kilonzo said they are investigating the incident. Area MCA Marcella Chepkirui urged police to expedite investigations to establish its cause.
