First Lady Margaret Kenyatta has urged the Maasai community to protect schoolgirls from early pregnancies and harmful cultural practices such as FGM. She said girls should be given an equal chance to get education to guarantee a bright future for them. “We must support and protect our girls from early pregnancies that affect their development. Our girls alongside our boys have the potential to become anything they wish to be,” the First Lady said. Margaret spoke in Narok West subcounty on Friday when she presided over the opening of Oloserian Women Empowerment Centre and inaugurated two new classrooms at Olkuroto Primary School. The school was renamed Margaret Kenyatta Olkuroto Primary School in her honour. The First Lady Kenyatta said she was particularly pleased to note that more girls from the area are benefiting from the school’s mentorship programmes. She also said there is a need for women to be empowered, saying its ripple effect impacts positively on families, communities and the country at large. “I have seen the impact of similar projects around our beautiful nation. I'm confident that the Oloserian women’s project and the adult literacy classes will provide women of this community knowledge and independence because women and mothers are the backbone of their families and communities,” the First Lady said. The empowerment centre provides an avenue where women from the area can make handicrafts and sell them to tourists to generate income. “Your dream of lifting the livelihoods of women and promoting girls education has today been fulfilled. I am sure that the entire community will experience the life-changing impact of the projects that we have inaugurated today,” Margaret said. In attendance were Narok Governor Samuel Tunai, Narok West MP Gabriel Tongoyo and Siana MCA Dominic Rakwa. Tunai pledged his support for the Olkuroto projects and assured of his commitment to continue promoting girls education in the county.
