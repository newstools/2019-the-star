The horrific incident in which 39 bodies were found near London on Wednesday in a container of a truck thought to have come from Bulgaria shows human trade is one of the fastest growing global organised criminality. It is clear the world is affected by human trafficking, whether as a country of origin, transit, or destination for victims. Human trafficking is attributed to a flawed capitalist economic system that puts resources in the hands of the handful capitalists and their cronies and the abnormally sharing of the revenues, hence leaving millions to languish in dire poverty. This has forced people, especially from ‘Third World countries migrating into other perceived better countries such as the Middle East and western countries in search of ‘better life’. The cruelty of world leaders has also contributed to this crime by engaging in endless war across the globe. It is an undeniable fact that children, women and elderly men are the victims of war. Atrocities in Palestine, where the Jewish forces continue detaining children and their mothers, Uyghur Muslims who are forced into “political camps for indoctrination” in China and the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya in Myanmar are examples. As a result of these horrendous acts by the oppressive states, millions of people have ended up at refugee camps and are subjected to inhumane treatment. All forms of oppression and mistreatment of human beings should be brought to an end since human lives are sacred. This can be achieved when we put strong economic policies aiming at the effective distribution of wealth so that the basic needs of all individuals are met thus tackling poverty.
