Kenya Volleyball Federation champions General Service Unit and Kenya Prisons are the winners of the Nandi County tournament staged at Kapsabet Showground. GSU routed their arch-rivals Kenya Prisons in 3-1 thrilling duel to lift the men’s title. It was the second time in less than two days that the paramilitary side beat the Prison warders. Coached by Gideon Tarus, GSU won the first set before Prisons levelled matters to 1-1 (25-19, 22-25). GSU regrouped ahead of the third set and changed the tide, winning 25-21. They then took charge of the proceedings in the fourth set, running away with a 25-17 win. Despite the win, GSU head coach Tarus is worried ahead of next month’s playoffs with his top players having picked injuries over the weekend. He, however, expressed confidence that the setbacks will not deter his team’s ambitions to defend the title. “This year, we have not lost a single match and I thank God. I applaud the players for their unrelenting efforts that have stemmed these performances. I still have about 12 to 14 players, who hopefully, will step up and fill that void left by the injured players. We are always ready,” said Tarus. On their way to the finals, the police outfit thrashed Equity Bank in straight sets of 22-25, 19-25 and 23-25 while Kenya Prison stunned Kenya Ports Authority 2-3 (16-25, 25-17, 21-25, 25-21, 7-15) in their penultimate clash. In the women’s competition, Kenya Prisons edged Kenya Commercial Bank to claim the title. KCB lost the opening set 18-25 but stepped up their game and managed to grab the second 25-18. The experienced wardresses returned to pile pressure on the bankers in subsequent sets, winning 22-25 and 20-25 for a 3-1 win. Mashing up praises for his side’s top performance, head coach Josp Barasa said: “Winning this tournament was not easy. The semis against Kenya Pipeline were particularly tough.” “All teams that have qualified for the play-offs are good and we have to give our best to defend our title,” he added. In their five-setter semi-finals thriller, the wardress confirmed their supremacy by bouncing back from a two sets’ deficit of 25-15 and 25-20 to win the remainder of the game 22-25, 20-25 and 13-15 for a 3-2 win. To cruise to the final, the bankers, coached by Japheth Munala had a friendly fire with their second-string squad winning in straight sets of 22-25, 19-25 and 23-25.
