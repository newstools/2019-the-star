Deputy President William Ruto has launched a scathing attack on a local daily for reporting that his attempts to cajole the President into a meeting backfired. The Daily Nation on Monday reported that attempts by Ruto to cajole President Uhuru Kenyatta into summoning Jubilee Partyâ€™s Parliamentary Group meeting backfired on Monday last week. Instead, Uhuru turned to opposition outfits ODM and Wiper to push Parliament to raise the borrowing ceiling to Sh9 trillion. But Ruto, who was not happy with the story, said the information was fake news. The DP also dismissed claims of the President turning to ODM and Wiper. He said he chaired the Intergovernmental Budget and Economic Council meetings and approved the budget before it was tabled in parliament.
