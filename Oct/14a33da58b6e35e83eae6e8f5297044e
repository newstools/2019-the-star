The Interior Ministry has dismissed claims that the grave of iconic freedom fighter Dedan Kimathi has been found at Kamiti Maximum Security Prison. In a tweet, on Saturday the ministry said: "Our attention has been drawn to news on some platforms that the grave of our freedom fighter Field Marshal Dedan Kimathi has been found at Kamiti Prison." They cautioned the public not to believe any information on the same unless it is communicated by the ministry through official communication channels. "Please note these claims are False; such info will be relayed to the public only via our official communication channels," read part of the tweet. The Dedan Kimathi Foundation on Friday said they had located the grave of Dedan Kimathi at Kamiti Maximum Prison, Nairobi. The foundation's CEO Wanjugu said the news is not only a relief to the family but also to the larger freedom struggle heroes fraternity. Wanjugu said they were waiting for orders from the Chief Justice David Maraga on excavation and exhumation of his remains before arranging for a decent send-off. Dedan died in February 1957 at the age of 37 after beingÂ convicted and executed for murder and terrorism by the British colonial government. Dedan was a rebel leader against the colonial government, which identified him as a terrorist alongside other Kenyans who opposed the system. The government recognised him as a hero in 2007 during Jamhuri Day. His bronze statue on Kimathi street was unveiled to recognise his effort towards independence.
