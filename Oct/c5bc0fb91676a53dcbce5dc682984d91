Long time football administrator Lodvick Aduda has accused Football Kenya Federation of going against their own statutes as well as those of  FIFA and CAF by allegedly excluding sub-branches from having an input in December 7 national elections. "FKF statutes are supposed to be in conformity with the national Constitution (2010), the Sports Act (2013) as well as CAF and FIFA statutes which the federation is affiliated to," said Aduda. "Nowhere have I seen a substantive position like that of a vice president of the federation being nominated. In all CAF and FIFA ExCos, VP's are subjected to elections like in all other senior positions. I wonder why FKF is violating its own statutes by requiring presidential aspirants to have running mates,” said Aduda. Aduda pointed out that the FIFA statutes clearly stipulate that office bearers be directly elected by the members, who come from the lowest levels (clubs) to the higher hierarchies. “By virtue of omitting sub-branches, FKF must now tell stakeholders who are its bonafide members and what are their categories,” added the Gor Mahia CEO. “Unless they do that, they will be placing members in different cadres discriminating against clubs who have not gained promotion but who take part in their leagues. If they do not do that then the clubs may find it fit to move to bodies or associations where they will be allowed to fully participate in their activities,” he warned. The former CEO of the defunct Kenya Football Federation which, with the blessings of FIFA, joined hands with then Football Kenya Limited to form the current federation further said the Sh400,000 fee for presidential candidates was prohibitive to prospective aspirants.
