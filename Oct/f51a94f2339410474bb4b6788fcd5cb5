World marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge will be the M-Pesa brand ambassador ahead of his attempt to ran sub-two hours over the weekend in Vienna in the Ineos 1:59 challenge. Safaricom has also dedicated its iconic M-Pesa brand in support of Kipchoge’s superhuman endeavour. Over the next seven days, the company will rebrand M-Pesa to 'Eliud 1:59' to commemorate the challenge. Safaricom Chief Executive officer Michael Joseph termed the event a milestone for Kipchoge. “The last few years have seen Kipchoge emerge not only as one of the greatest athletes ever, but also as one of the most accomplished people ever. It is a privilege to partner with him on this historic occasion and as an icon, it is only befitting to offer our M-Pesabrand in his recognition,” added Joseph. Joseph said the logo 'Eliud 1:59' that will run for the next seven days is to support Kipchoge in his challenge to become the first-ever athlete to run a full marathon in under two hours in the 'INEOS 1:59 Challenge' in Vienna, Austria on a yet to be decided time and day. The company will also provide a free YouTube bundle on the day of Kipchoge’s race. From 8 am to 4 pm, all Safaricom customers can stream the race live on their phones at no cost. The bundle will be accessed by dialling *159# upon which a customer will receive a free YouTube bundle, allowing them to stream the entire race at no cost. “We are honoured to renew our commitment with Eliud Kipchoge and to support him as he races against time. As part of our support, we will be empowering any Kenyan across the country to stream the challenge for free, wherever they are, with the advantage of our strong network and wide coverage. For every Kenyan, Kipchoge is a reflection of our resilience and determination as he has taken on challenge after challenge,” added Joseph. Kipchoge’s partnership with Safaricom dates back to 2017 when the company launched its 'Twaweza' brand campaign with the marathoner taking the role of brand ambassador.
