An annual tarmac motorsports event, Racewars, organised by Delta Motorsports Club at Tatu City this weekend has attracted over 50 participants. The two-day event is expected to treat fans to exhilarating displays of motoring artistry and brings together racing drivers and motoring enthusiasts from across the country and the East African region. The race has been divided into two events and promises to keep spectators occupied throughout the show. The event, which involves drivers navigating a set course using prescribed manoeuvres, will take place on Day 1. Drivers are supposed to navigate without hitting any of the barriers as a penalty for hitting the obstacles will count against the driver’s time. An after-party running from 6 pm to 6 am at the Tatu City will close the Day 1 activities. On Day 2, fans will be treated to a drag race, pitting drivers in a one-on-one straight-line racing. It involves drivers recording the best time over a comparatively quarter-mile segment and the best-clocked timer wins the segment. Throughout the weekend, spectators will enjoy a family village area, where they can shop, eat and play. “Tatu City offers Racewars the closest-ever venue to Nairobi,” according to Joe Murai, the founder of Delta Motorsports Club. “The beautiful roads within the city will spice up the race for both drivers and fans. The grounds that we will be using are expansive and will be more than enough for all the activities we plan,” he added. Located just off Exit 11 on the Thika Super Highway and along the Ruiru-Kiambu Road, Tatu City has multiple access points for racing enthusiasts. Advance tickets to the event are available on www.ticketsasa.com at Sh1,500 which will cover attendance to both the Gymkhana and drag race and also allow entry to the after-party.
