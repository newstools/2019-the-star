The DCI has taken over investigations into the death of a man booked at Ratado police post in West Ugenya in Siaya. Sylvester Otieno Odoi, 25, died in unclear circumstances Siaya county police commander Francis Kooli on Monday told the Star detectives had made good progress in the probe and were only waiting for a postmortem report to finalise their report. Residents have asked the Independent Police Oversight Authority and the Independent Medico-Legal Unit to intervene and prevent possible cover-up. Kooli said initial reports showed Odoi had been arrested for allegedly stealing iron sheets but was released after the owner decided to drop charges. However, Odoi's relatives turned up with him at a nearby health centre while drunk, Kooli said. Both relatives and residents have denied the Kooli's report, insisting Odoi was well until his arrest and hauling into the police post. Relatives said Odoi was not a thief but had been contracted by a friend to look for market for some old iron sheets. "It is the same friend who reported to a village elder that he had allegedly lost the iron sheets and knew the thief," his father Godfrey Odoi said. He said it was the village elder and the accuser who flushed Odoi from a homestead in the neighbouring Nyamila village and bundled him on a motorcycle to the police post. "The scene was horrible. They handcuffed him and tied him on a window while beating him" said a worker at a hotel adjacent to the police post. "I have never heard a man cry for mercy like that." Godfrey said they pleaded with the officers to release his firstborn son but they instead demanded a Sh3,000 bribe. He said his other son offered Sh1,000 but the officers rejected the cash and ordered them out to "go look for more money." "Before we went far, we saw the police carrying my son to the nearby Sifuyo Health Centre," Godfrey said.  edited by peter obuya
