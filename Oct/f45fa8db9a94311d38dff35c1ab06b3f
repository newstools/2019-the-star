Police confiscated over 40,000 sim cards in Juja town and Gwa Kairu during a Sunday night operation. Five suspects - Joseph Kuria, Joyce Kagure, George Maina, Evans Getabu and Loise Wanjiku - were arrested during the raid and are being held awaiting arraignment. Four suspects were arrested at Jeremy Apartments, while Kagure was nabbed at Gwa Kairo. Several mobile phones, three laptops and lists of names with ID numbers were confiscated. Investigations are ongoing before the five suspects are arraigned. The arrests come as the office of the DCI warned Kenyans over the purchase of electronics from dealers without a fixed physical address. The DCI has said the purchase of electronics which include mobile phones, laptops, TV sets should be accompanied byÂ a receipt that clearly itemises the particulars of the bought gadget. DCI termed it 'risky and dangerous' to buy any electronic device from suspicious outlets, the majority which may be stolen items by gangsters.
