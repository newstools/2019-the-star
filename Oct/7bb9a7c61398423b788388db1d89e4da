The National Transport and Safety Authority has suspended nine matatu Saccos for failing to comply with the provisions of the laws. NTSA director general Francis Meja said in a statement on Monday that the nine failed to comply with section 5(1)of the NTSA's regulations. The regulations require a PSV Sacco or company to operate a minimum of 30 serviceable motor vehicles. Meja urged the public not to board any vehicles belonging to the saccos to avoid any inconveniences. "The traffic department has been advised to impound any vehicle belonging to the nine found operating contrary to the suspension," Meja said. Other companies affected include Mwamba Sacco which operates Komarock-Jogoo Road-Mfangano Street. Some of Mwamba Sacco vehicles operate on Mfangano Street-Eastleigh, Jogoo Road-Buruburu-Civil Servant-Garage. Marvellous Travellers Sacco which operates from Komarock-Savannah-Jogoo Road-Eastleigh-Mfangano Street was also affected. The license for Moonlight Coach Company which operates from Commercial-Thika Road-Mathare North has also been revoked.  Huruma Minibus that operates on-Pangani-Kariokor-Tusker Bus Station also had its licences revoked. Also revoked was the license of Transafaris Sacco which operates from Nairobi-Nakuru-Kisumu-Busia. The sacco also operates Nairobi-Busia-Nakuru-Kericho-Kisumu and Nairobi-Nakuru-Kisumu-Kakamega-Bungoma. Edited by R.Wamochie
