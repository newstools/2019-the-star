A Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology lecturer was on Tuesday sentenced to three years in prison without the option of a fine for fraud. Jane Queen was found guilty of defrauding Ezekiel Momanyi, a police officer, of Sh420, 000 by pretending she would sell him a vehicle on June 19. The charge sheet said Queen met Momanyi in Westlands, Nairobi, where she was paid the cash. Momanyi told court the accused person approached him and confirmed to him that she had a Prado that was on sale for Sh500,000. Momanyi said he trusted the lecturer and decided to pay the cash but she failed to deliver the vehicle to him. “I paid Sh350,000 as a deposit and  we agreed to meet in Kangemi where she was to come with the vehicle but she came without it,” he said. He said since he did not have enough cash, he consulted his wife who decided to sell a plot to purchase the vehicle. The lecturer later called him to Buru Buru but when he arrived he never found her. Queen denied the charge and  begged for mercy saying she was a mother of two and the breadwinner of her family including her cousin’s children. Chief magistrate Joyce Gandani however declined the request, saying three years was good enough for justice. Gandani said the accused breached the trust of a friend by stealing from him. The prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt, she said.
