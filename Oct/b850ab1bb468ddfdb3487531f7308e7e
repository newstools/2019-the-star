Migori county's proximity to Tanzania and Uganda is a major challenge in tackling the recruitment of terrorists in the country, stakeholders have said. Also blamed are the concentration of learning institutions and the expanse of the region with little government measures to control terrorism. “Migori should be placed among other disadvantaged counties which might suffer terrorism or recruitment because of our border status,” Migori Governor Okoth Obado said. Obado said the National Counter-Terrorism Centre should place Migori in the same red alert counties with those at the Coast and in Northeastern. “The centre should look for linkages between our people and the policy to end extremism as foreigners should not find a safe landing place in Migori,” Obado said. He spoke on Friday at the end of a two-day workshop by NCTC which brought together civil society, media, the security officers, political leaders and also the local administration. Suna East subcounty commissioner Dennis Mutiso said that Migori being on the border is not exempted from any form of terrorist attacks and violent extremism.
