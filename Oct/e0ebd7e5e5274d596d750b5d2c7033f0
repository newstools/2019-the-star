The Baringo County Assembly on Tuesday unanimously approved CPA Richard Koech to take over as the new clerk. He replaces Joseph Koech (no relation) who was removed from office on May 2 over allegations of impropriety. "We chose him based on his tested and proved integrity, academic qualifications and experience," MCA Solomon Makal (Kolowa) said. He introduced the motion to approve Koech. "A long list of 29 applicants was forwarded and only eight candidates were shortlisted. Koech emerged the best" Speaker David Kiplagat said. During interviews Koech scored the highest mark of 86.86, Nixon Mutai scored 83.29and Samson Kibii 70. Assembly Deputy speaker Ameja Zelemoi, who is MCA Churo-Amaya, thanked the members for choosing merit over political affiliation. They expressed displeasure over delayed salaries and other issues involving the previous clerk. Richard Koech served during the former Governor Benjamin Cheboi's administration as Chief Officer of  Finance and Health. Immediately Stanley Kitpis took over in September 2017, he reshuffled the entire Cheboicabinet and his qualification immediately landed Koech a job as Finance Executive Committee for West Pokot County under Governor John Lonyangapuo. “I am deeply humbled by the overwhelming endorsement, Koech posted on his social media page. He said the 100 per cent approval rating not only demonstrates the confidence of the MCAS in his competence and professionalism but also a greater quest for diligence and good services. o. “I promise to live up to this billing and deliver to the expectations of the assembly or exceed them," Koech said.
