The Orange party has said the Kibra by-election voter register provided by IEBC is incomplete. The party on Thursday said the register released to the public does not have voters' ID numbers,Â  which they said is making the verification process hard. ODM has asked the electoral commission to provide Kibra residents with a voter register that has the full name of the voter, polling station and his/her ID number. The party's plea comes a week before the constituency holds its by-election. The commission had earlier this week released a fully revised voter register for Kibra constituency. Through a Gazette notice dated October 25, IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati said the commission completed the process of revising the Kibra voters register. A total of 118,658 voters are registered in Kibra. Kibra residents will decide on November 7 on who will be their next MP to replace the late legislator, Ken Okoth, who succumbed to cancer. The by-election has attracted 24 candidates, including McDonald Mariga of Jubilee, Imran Okoth of ODM, Khamisi Butichi of Ford Kenya, Eliud Owalo of ANC, among others.
