The heavy rains which are being experienced in several parts of the country are set to continue for the next seven days. A statement from the Kenya Meteorological Department on Thursday indicates that heavy rainfall of more than 20mm in a day is set to be experienced up to Sunday, October 28. High rainfall intensity is to be experienced in the Coastal parts of the country, Eastern and Central regions. Residents in the mentioned areas have been asked to be on the lookout since floods may also be caused by the downpour. "The rainfall is expected to continue for the entire season with occasional breaks. Flooding and landslides may, therefore, be triggered by any substantial amount of rainfall in low-lying areas and over hilly grounds," the weatherman said. The department has warned the public from driving or walking through the moving waters. Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa on Wednesday said the ongoing heavy rains have so far claimed more than 20 lives and affected more than 1,000 people. Wamalwa spoke after meeting with a task force in Nairobi which will be establishing a digital platform for provision of relief assistance. “If the rains continue, we expect more residents to be displaced and we are therefore calling on Kenyans living in flood-prone areas to move to higher grounds to avoid any further loss of lives,” he said. Four children drowned in a pool of water near Eldas town in Wajir county on Tuesday after a downpour. Witnesses said Khalid Hajji, Zakaria Maalim, Abdimalik Mahamud and Abdirahman Mohamed were crossing the area when they were swept away by the floodwaters.
