Mathare United coach Salim Ali has challenged his team to play on the front foot after they needed a second-half comeback at the Moi Stadium in Kisumu to claim their first away win of the season against Kisumu All Stars. Gershom Arabe opened the scoring with a deflected strike in the 46th minute before Kevin Kimani levelled in the 69th. Clifford Alwanga sealed the comeback three minutes later to send the 2008 champions up to seventh on the log. “I thank my players for securing the win. Those are three invaluable points which keep us in the direction that we want to go. But aside from that I was not particularly impressed with our display. We were lethargic and did not play to our strengths. Credit to All Stars though for making it difficult for us,” noted Salim on the clubs official portal. The comeback saw Mathare maintain their unbeaten start to the season but Salim is concerned by the fact that his boys have conceded first thrice in the six matches they have played so far. “The comebacks can be analysed in two ways, either positive or negative. The positive is that we have the character to respond after conceding first. The negative aspect is that we are only responding after we have gone down in matches. It's a worrying situation but one I believe we will tackle in our subsequent matches,” he observed. Mathare will be back in action this weekend in a mouthwatering duel against champions and league leaders Gor Mahia.
