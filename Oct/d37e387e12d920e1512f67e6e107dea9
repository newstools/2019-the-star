Harambee Starlets will meet with Zambia in the fourth round of the CAF Women Tokyo 2020 Olympics qualifiers after both were victorious on Tuesday. Stars needed an extra time penalty from school girl Jentrix Shikangwa to claim a 1-0 aggregate win over highly fancied Ghana Black Queens while Zambia summarily dismissed Botswana with a 3-0 win in the two legged duel following a 2-0 second leg triumph in Gaborone. Their clash will be played between the 4th and 12th of November. “We have to continue building up to stay on course with our dream”said an elated Starlets coach David Ouma after his sides victory at Kasarani. “The team must go on holding up and build on the mental attributes we have gained particularly in our last two matches.”he added as he looked forward to the penultimate qualifier early next month. “I know we will be ready regardless of our next opponents. What we have achieved is a favor from God because this team is a prayerful one. The federation has also invested a lot and with the support of our fans and the media and other stakeholders I believe sky is the limit for our girls.” remarked Ouma. The Starlets coach heaped praise on seventeen year Jenrix a secondary school student at Wiyeta girls for keeping her nerve at the most crucial moment ot earn the Kenyan girls a crucial advantage that they did not relinquish “It shows the level of self belief that is in this team. At only seventeen Jentrix scores a penalty at an important moment and she did that also in the game against Ethiopia. This shows the character that the girls have and hopefully in the end wit will lead to success.”Ouma concluded. Should Starlets negotiate past Zambia in the next round they will look forward to a clash against either Ivory Coast or Cameroon who meet in the other match up for a historic berth to the Olympics.
