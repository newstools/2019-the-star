Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations probing a Catholic priest’s murder on Sunday recovered withdrawal receipts from the deceased’s bank accounts. The documents showing money was withdrawn from the late Michael Maingi’s bank accounts were recovered at a house in Mnarani, Kilifi county. A detective privy to the investigations divulged that the house is believed to have been rented by the main murder suspect, Michael Mutunga, two days after the killing. Some hotel receipts were also recovered from the same house. “Also recovered from the house were newly purchased household items totaling to approximately Sh60,000, supermarket receipts and blood-stained clothes,” the sleuth confided to the Star on Monday. The source added that the clothes had been taken to the Government Chemist for forensic analysis. According to the source, the garage where the deceased’s car colour was allegedly changed from black to white on October 12 was also identified. The investigations took a dramatic twist on Friday after Mutunga said he had been in a romantic relationship with the deceased. According to a detective, the 25-year-old claimed that he was in an intimate relationship with the priest. The investigators have since gone back to the drawing board following the fresh claims by the trained nursery school teacher. A postmortem on the priest’s body conducted at Montezuma Monalisa Funeral Home in Machakos on Thursday confirmed he died of stab wounds. The 40-year-old priest disappeared from his parent’s Tala home in Matungulu, Machakos county on October 5, and his body recovered on October 16 from a shallow grave in a dry riverbed at Mbeere South, Embu county.
