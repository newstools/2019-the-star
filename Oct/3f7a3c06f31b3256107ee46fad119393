A PSV sacco has struck a deal with Governor Charity Ngilu to have members' attire made by the Kitui County Textile Centre. Kitui Nairobi Transport Welfare Association Sacco (Kinatwa) chairman Clinton Wambua told journalists in Kitui on Sunday that the arrangement makes economic sense and will help them save money. “My members welcome the move by Ngilu to agree that our sacco will acquire staff uniforms and other apparels at subsidised prices. It will be good for business because of the huge savings we will make,” the Kinatwa sacco chairman said. He said Ngilu on Saturday met the sacco members at a Kitui hotel and invited them to do business with the county government-owned Kicotec. “Henceforth, all our staff uniforms and dustcoats will be sourced from Kicotec. It is cost effective with the huge discounts we negotiated. It is also a way of helping to nurture the local economy,” Wambua said. The chairman said the sacco membership will support Governor Ngilu’s agenda for Kitui and create wealth. A dispatch from the governor's communication desk indicated that during the meeting with Kinatwa members, Ngilu urged members to focus on the bigger picture and available opportunities. The governor said her administration had availed a conducive business environment and many opportunities that had not been fully exploited by local entrepreneurs. She cited the County Empowerment Fund. “This financial year we have proposed the County Empowerment Fund and once approved by our county assembly, all saccos and businesspeople should come together and access loans at as little as five per cent interest,” Ngilu said.
