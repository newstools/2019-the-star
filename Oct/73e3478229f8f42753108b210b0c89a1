Kenya women's Premier league side Spedag have blamed their relegation threat this season to lack of new signings. Spedag are currently bottom of the log with 12 points with only two games to the end of the season. Team manager Sarah Ogonyo admitted that lack of quality signing due to insufficient funding has put them in that situation.Â  "We were not able to sign new players because we have been struggling financially. In addition, we were sluggish and did not make the best use of the opportunities that came our way," she said. The team is scheduled to face fourth-placed Thika Queens in their 27th round and Ogonyo has exuded confidence that they will finish the league on a high. "This will be a tough match but we hope to maximise on our chances," she said. Ogonyo said relegation would be a big blow for them considering they have never been in that situation. "However in case we are relegated, I believe we will bounce back," she promised. Spedag are hoping Kayole Starlets, who are currently on 14 points, falter in one of their matches.
