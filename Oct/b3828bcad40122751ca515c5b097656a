'In Pursuit of Peace in Africa' was recently launched at the Serena Hotel. The book is by Lt Gen (Rtd) Daniel Opande. It is a tale of a God-fearing young man from the then South Nyanza leaving home for secondary school in Kakamega and ending up in the army just as the British were departing from Kenya. He serves his country with valour and honour, risking his life to bring peace to Namibia, Mozambique, Liberia, Sierra Leone and eventually retiring honourably. The book has been recommended to all peace institutions and military colleges.
