Two more suspects, Solomon Mutava and Kavivya Mwangagi have been arraigned at a Milimani court over the murder of Catholic priest Michael Kyengo. Police sought to detain the two for eight days pending investigations, a request the court granted through magistrate Hellen Okwani. The eight-day detention comes even after Mwangangi sought to confess in an open court on how they conspired to murder the slain priest. His confession was cut short by presiding magistrate Okwani when she directed that he confesses at the police station in the presence of his family and a chief inspector. In his narrative, Mwangangi told the court that he was picked on the fateful night the priest died and directed to a car where the priest was stack in the booth. "His hands were tied and at some point, I was asked to tie his feet and hands with ropes," he said. Mwangangi further added that at some point his colleague, Mutava whom they were with in the same car asked the slain priest to give his bank account number and state his M-Pesa balance. Mwangangi alleged that Mutava transferred cash from the slain priest's bank account to an unknown account. The two arraigned suspects now make the total number of detained suspects in the murder three. Michael Mutunga was arraigned on Thursday at the same court and will be detained for 10 days at the Kilimani police station. The three will appear in court on November 6.
