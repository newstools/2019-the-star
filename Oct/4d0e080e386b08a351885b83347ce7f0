Twenty-seven inmates sitting the KCPE exam at Naivasha GK prison expressed confidence that they will be able to challenge other national exam takers. Inmates from the county’s largest penal institution said their teachers, who are fellow prisoners, had prepared them well or the exams that kick off Tuesday. Officer in charge of the prison Samuel Ruto said the oldest inmate sitting the exam is 59 years old, the youngest is 19. The assistant commissioner of prisons said inmates were all set for the examination despite a shortage of learning materials and classrooms. "They are ready to compete with those in the public and private schools,” he said. Ruto said the education programme has become one of the major rehabilitation tools and an increasing number of inmates are joining. “We are keen to work with other stakeholders in the education sector to make this programme even better and more productive as it has changed the lives of many inmates,” he said. Naivasha subcounty commissioner Mathioya Mbogo said all was set for the exams despite some heavy rains in some region. He said 6,616 candidates had been registered for the national examinations in the 109 centers across the subcounty. “We have powerful vehicles to ferry the examinations materials to areas receiving heavy rains,” he said. Addressing the press in his office, Mbogo said security and staffing had also been addressed. “Of the 109 centres, this one is in prison, while the other in DEB Primary School will cater for the private students registered in adult classes,” he said.
