Othaya constituency has lunched a Sh600,000 greening programme that targets all public schools. MP Gichuki Mugambi on Monday said each of the 56 schools in the constituency has received 50 Hass avocado tree seedlings. They plan to plant 3,000 tree seedlings in the first phase of the environmental management vote. The drive is funded by the NG-CDF. "We have started the project in all primary schools but we will also provide the seedlings to secondary schools,” he said. The move is meant to increase forest cover, provide an alternative income-generating activity for the schools, while also improving food security. "We have opted to plant the avocado trees, which grow in a bushy way and so very ideal for afforestation.  The trees will also provide fruits for our children upon maturity," the lawmaker said. The fruits have a lot of nutrients useful for learners and will help improve nutrition for children, besides enabling the institutions to earn extra income. The avocado trees are expected to start producing fruits in the next two years. The MP also distributed 600 lockable desks to 21 primary schools, with another 35 schools set to benefit in the next phase. The entire project is expected to cost Sh 1.4 million. “The remaining schools will have received the desks by January next year,” he said. The project is meant to ensure pupils in Standards 7-8 can securely lock their books so they do not have to carry the ones they would not use at home. They can leave them in class as they leave for home in the evening. He said most of the pupils have been carrying a lot of books daily. “The books when carried daily to and from school wear out fast, but if kept safely, the learners will use them for a long time,” he said.
