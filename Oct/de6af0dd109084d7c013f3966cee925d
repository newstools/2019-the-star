Taita Taveta county assembly has passed a motion to establish an annual cultural festival. The objective is to conserve and promote the county's culture and traditions. “The government shall now be required to allocate funds for this important festival so that Taita Taveta can enjoy the full benefits brought by the many visitors and tourists who shall be attending the cultural fete,” Youth and Sport committee chairperson Rose Shingira said. She moved the motion. Shingira said the festival will showcase the beauty and culture of Taita Taveta as well as promote peace and economic growth. Some of their traditions include storytelling (locally referred to as Chughano), poetry and riddles (known as Ndawi). Traditional delicacies include kimanga, kimumunde and mkango, among others. Traditional dances, which will be featured in the festival, include Kirindi, Mwazindika, Kisole and Urwasi. Majority leader Jason Tuja said the festival should be rigorously marketed to boost the economy and empower residents. “This county is a historical rich county, with lots of sites that can boost tourism if they are well marketed. From the world wars battlefields to Mau Mau caves, all these can be incorporated in the festival,” he said. In 2014, the National Museums of Kenya gazetted 15 historical sites in the county as sites of historical interest and significance. They include Salaita Hills, Voi Commonwealth War Graves, Kenyatta Caves in Wundanyi, the first District Commissioner’s house in Taveta, Taveta ACK Holy Trinity Church in Mahoo and Mahoo pastor’s residence. The County is also rich in tangible expressions, including arts such as body painting, carvings, pottery, jewellery, basketry, pictorial woven tissues, needlework, handcrafts, musical instruments and cultural heritage, as well as natural sites.
