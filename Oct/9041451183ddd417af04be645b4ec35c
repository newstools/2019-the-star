President Uhuru Kenyatta on Sunday sent condolences to the families who lost their loved ones following an IED attack on GSU officers in Daadab, Garissa county. The 10 officers from the Harhar General Service Unit (GSU) Camp were killed at Degow on the road between Liboi and Damajale close to the Kenya-Somalia border when their vehicle ran over an Improvised Explosive Device during a routine security patrol. "The President sends his heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the families of the departed Officers and assures them of government support during this difficult period of mourning," a statement sent by State House spokesperson Kanze Dena read. "The President sends a strong reminder to all misguided elements out to compromise the safety and security of Kenyans across the country that the government and the people of Kenya will never succumb to their cowardly terrorist actions." Inspector General of Police Hilary Mutyambai on Saturday said reinforcement had been sent to the area to pursue the attackers and investigations launched. Garissa Governor Ali Korane condemned the incident as "killing of our security officers by the enemies of humanity." "Saddened by the news of the death of 10 police officers killed in an IED attack along Liboi-Damajale road, Garissa County. I extend my condolences to their family, relatives and colleagues," Korane said in a statement.
