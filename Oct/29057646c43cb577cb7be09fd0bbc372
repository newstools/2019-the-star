Consolata Shrine Westlands on Wednesday hosted a requiem mass for Felistus Nyakiamo. Felistus was the wife of former Barclays Bank chairman Peter Nyakiamo. Mourners were dressed in all black and a touch of pink. Every speaker had something good to remember about Felistus, especially the grandchildren, who could not hold back their tears. In attendance were the immediate family, National Fund for the Disabled of Kenya chairperson Kristina Wambui, and family friends. The body will be laid to rest on Saturday.
