Daniel Simiyu and Nancy Jelagat will be chasing their maiden Standard Chartered Half Marathon titles when this year's race go down in Nairobi on Sunday. The winners of 2019 Family Bank Eldoret half marathon will be running for the first time on one of the most celebrated half marathons and the duo has vowed to make a difference when they line up on Sunday. Simiyu, the national 5,000m champion failed to represent the country at the just concluded IAAF World Championships after failing to meet anti-doping regulations of being drug-tested for a minimum of three times out of the competition. But that has not bothered his coach, Erick Kogo, who insists the runner has better chances going forward. “When he was ejected from the team, I had to think very fast and organise a race for him. That was a good consolation when he won the Kisii 10km road race and went ahead to win at Family Bank. The two wins have consoled him enough,” said Kogo. “I want to run well in the Standard Chartered 21km race but my real focus is the 2020 Olympic Games. I have to do what is needed to make the team,” said Simiyu, who trains in Iten. Another upstart, Jelagat, who has dominated local races lately, said: “My training is going on well. I want to run well at the lucrative Standard Chartered half marathon.”
