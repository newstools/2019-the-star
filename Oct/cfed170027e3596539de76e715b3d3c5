Unified sports will be introduced in primary and secondary schools for students with and without intellectual disability next year. This is an initiative by Special Olympics of Kenya, who are collaborating with the ministry of education in an effort to achieve inclusion amongst people with and without intellectual disability. Susan Masila, the national director at SOK, said there will be a demonstration of unified sport at the national stage for both primary and secondary schools next year. Speaking at the periphery of the inaugural Africa Region Youth Leadership Summit, Masila said: “As we launch the first 'Lead to Include' project in Nairobi, we (SOK) already have plans in place to start from the lowest level with the ministry. We thank the ministry (of education) for their cooperation.” The Summit has attracted 50 participants from 12 countries including Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Gambia, Mauritius, Senegal, South Africa, Randa, Tanzania and hosts Kenya. Masila recognises the progress they have made in the country but averred there is still more to be done to eliminate stigma, stereotypes, isolation and discrimination that people with intellectual disability face, and most importantly their access to sports. From the three-day event, youth leaders will develop and expand their understanding of how they can drive social inclusion in their countries and communities. “Sports has to build a world where everyone is accepted, respected and dignified, therefore Special Olympics is both the foundation and the building blocks of a unified generation,” said Cabinet Secretary for Sports Amina Mohamed, who was represented Richard Ombeva. The event was made possible by Lane Global Youth Leadership and supported by Kantar, Microsoft and Lions Club International Foundation.
