Comedian Jalang'o took a bashing from Luo women at the weekend for marrying a Taita woman. Jalang'o and Amina Chao married in a private traditional ceremony on Saturday, to the disappointment of Luo women. The ladies from the lakeside took to social media to blast the radio host, saying there are more than enough of them to go around and he should have picked one of them. But Luo men have come to Jalango's defence, saying many Luo women are proud and do not respect their men. "Truth be told Luo ladies are somehow lazy and who wants a lazy woman? They don't think about tomorrow," Bob said. "Most Luo ladies are club-hoppers and value things that are of no importance. "They are also not patient with their men, that is why Luo men prefer to marry outside their tribe.' His sentiments were echoed by Steve. “One ... undoing for Luo women is this thing called ‘Osemoke Oliel’. For those who don’t know what that [is], it’s the other version of parte after parte after parte,” he said. Women are often stereotyped as loudmouthed. According to one Kenyan man, Luo women are more loudmouthed than their counterparts from other tribes. "Luo men with their huge egos, pride and loud voices cannot marry a woman who has their ego, pride and loud voices. That will be like a madhouse," he said. "That is why most [Luo men] marry outside their tribe because they need a chilled woman to have sanity in the home."
