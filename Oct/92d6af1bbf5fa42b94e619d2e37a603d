The decision by the Ministry of Education to transfer pupils of Precious Talent Academy to other schools has received opposition from parents who have faulted the move on several accounts such as the distance of the new school from their homes. In this case, pupils will be left to suffer if the push and pull continues between the state and parents. What the ministry failed to do is to carry out a consultative meeting with stakeholders of the school. Considering the incident occurred in the third termâ€“being the shortest term in the academic calendar and the term of national exams, there are other ways those pupils would have been provided with a safer learning environment without interfering with their preparation for the much-hyped examinations.
