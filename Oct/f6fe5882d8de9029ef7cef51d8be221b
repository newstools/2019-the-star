The Back to Rhythm campaign started at Nyayo National Stadium on Thursday. It also involved cardiac screening for over 2,000 athletes in Nairobi and Eldoret. There was a cycling challenge thereafter from Nairobi to Eldoret, led by career cyclist David Kinjah. The campaign is part of the efforts to drive Heart Health awareness and was a precursor to the World Heart Day on Sunday. This third phase specifically targets sportsmen and women engaged in rigorous sporty activities, who are said to be vulnerable to heart-related complications.
