Former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga on Wednesday rubbished a report in one of the dailies in which KRA is probing car tax fraud against him, ODM leader Raila Odinga and three other MPs. Magwanga said the report is meant to tarnish his character adding that due process was followed when he bought the vehicle in 2007. The former MP asked why he was included among other MPs being sought for the offence and yet he had left the position. "The report is malice, a witch hunt and I am not aware of the intended purpose and is only meant to injure my reputation," Magwanga said. According to the former legislator, the vehicle – KBZ 333Q, which is a former government vehicle -  is his but it used to be the property of the Health department of Rachuonyo subcounty. "I fulfilled all the requirements while buying the vehicle which bore registration number GKY611," he said. "The vehicle was officially advertised by the former DC Rachuonyo on May 23, 2007. I bid just like any other person and won the tender and it was then released after meeting all the conditions as per the advert." Magwanga was then issued with a letter of offer and paid the full sum before being given a letter of release to facilitate full ownership of the vehicle, he said. It is a requirement that after a vehicle is valued following inspection. The former lawmaker said he has genuine documents to prove that due process was followed. "I have the inspection certificate, a letter of offer, receipts for the tender, a copy of adverts and even the minutes to approve the tender committee's decision." The transfer letter, which is in his possession, was signed by former Health PS Hezron O Nyangito for the Toyota Land Cruiser, Magwanga said. He said he paid for duty at National Bank in Kisumu.
