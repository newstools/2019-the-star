The annual Mama Sarah Obama 15km road race earlier scheduled for this Saturday has been postponed indefinitely. Athletics Kenya (AK) Nyanza North chairman Joseph Ochieng did not reveal reasons behind the postponement of the annual event. “I wish to inform athletes that the event scheduled for October 20 will not be held. New dates will be announced later,” he said. At the same time, Ochieng announced that the annual World Aids Marathon will be held on December 1 in Kisumu. He appealed to corporates and well-wishers to support the race. “This is the only marathon across the world which is held on the World Aids Day. We risk losing it due to limited sponsorship,” Ochieng added. The Richard Brodsky Foundation sponsors the race. Brodsky and his wife Jodi are expected to participate in this year's event.  Last year, Brodsky finished the race in 5:04.46 with Jodi crossing the finish line in 5:44.45. Ochieng also announced that the Safaricom Kisumu 10km road race will be held on December 15 in Kisumu. The event was cut down from full marathon due to reduced sponsorship. Ochieng challenged county governments of Siaya, Kisumu and Homa Bay to sponsor sports events in the region.
