A Kisii MCA wants the county executive to explain why it never spent health funds from the Danish International Development Agency which resulted in audit queries. Naomi Bosire said the Danish government had raised concerns over the spending of Sh2.2 billion donor funds it gave to support health functions in devolved units. Bosire told the assembly the audit indicated that 15 counties have unspent funds in their accounts for Universal Health Coverage support programme for level 2 and 3 hospitals. She sought a statement from Health committee chairman Benson Ongeri. She told the session chaired by Speaker David Kombo that media reports showed that Kisii was among those with unspent funds, adding that auditors cleared 20 counties to receive funds this year. “Danida has transferred Sh468.7 million to the National Treasury for the first half of the 2019-20 allocation, which is awaiting transfer to counties,” a statement from Danish Embassy Deputy Head of Mission Henrik Larsen reads. She informed Kombo that Danida has given counties a deadline to utilise the money or return it to the organisation. “I am calling upon the county government to give information on the total sum of Danish funds it received and the list of hospitals that have benefited." She also appealed to the Executive explain steps it has taken to ensure the county does not miss out on Danida funding. Danida has been supporting the health sector in Kenya for more than 35 years, the ward rep said. “The organisation emphasises on supporting devolution process within the sector and aims at a sustainable path for the sector’s economy,” Bosire told the House. She said the programme addresses sexual and reproductive health and maternal, child and adolescent health and gender-based violence. Kombo directed Ongeri to give a response to the House within 14 days. Edited by R.Wamochie
