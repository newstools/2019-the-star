Former deputy Auditor-General Stephen Ndung√∫ Kinuthia has been arraigned and charged with irregular procurement of audit software. Kinuthia was charged alongside 13 others including Charles Njuguna, an advocate of the High Court, of buying an audit vault software at Sh100,675,680 against its estimated cost. Also charged were Stephen Kinuthia and his two sons, Desmond Kinuthia and Nelson Kinuthia. They, however, denied the charges before Anti-corruption Magistrate Douglas Ogoti. The DPP did not oppose their bail and bond application. The DPP urged the court to grant the accused persons stringent terms commensurate to the charges and money lost. The prosecution also asked for the accused to deposit their passports and for the court to order that they should not access their offices or contact any of the prosecution witnesses. The defense lawyers told the court to take into account that the eleventh accused, Nelson Kinuthia is sick. The court was told that Kinuthia has TB and the court should factor that when it comes to granting him bail. His lawyer claimed that Kinuthia was conducting his day to day affairs when the transactions were carried out. He said Kinuthia only recieved remittances in his client account which was disbursed in accordance with his briefs. His lawyer wants him to be granted a free bond or a Sh100,000 bail. The bail ruling will be on Wednesday at 10.30am.
