The Kakamega county assembly has started the process of replacing retired clerk Patrick Kamwesser. The assembly in an advert announced the shortlisted candidates for the position. Those shortlisted are acting clerk Laban Atemba, Edward Anguche, John Simwah, Yvonne Shiganga and Emily Sitati. They will be interviewed on October 29 at Bishop Nicholas Stam Pastoral Centre. “The applicants should also bring with them current clearance certificates from Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), Helb, certificate of good conduct, the EACC and the Credit Reference Bureau (CRB),” the advert signed by speaker Morris Buluma read. The assembly has operated without a substantive clerk for close to a year after the County Assembly Service Board forcibly retired Kamwesser, three years before his retirement age. The board did not give reasons for its actions. Kamwesser went to court to seek redress. The two parties, however, agreed to settle the matter out of court where they negotiated an exit package for him. Three months ago, the MCAs filed a motion to impeach the speaker for being truant and disrespecting them. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya talked to them after they were taken for one week retreat in Kisumu, after which the motion died a natural death. Oparanya is said to have told the MCAs that they would rather remove the entire service board, not the speaker alone. Some MCAs have in the past accused Oparanya of micromanaging the assembly affairs.
