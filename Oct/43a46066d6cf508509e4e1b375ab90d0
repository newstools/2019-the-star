Three people escaped death narrowly after two boats collided in Lamu on Monday. They suffered head, chest and limb injuries and are currently admitted at the King Fahad Hospital in Lamu Island where they are undergoing treatment. The three were aboard a passenger speedboat that was heading to Lamu Island from the Mokowe Jetty, when the vessel collided head-on with another speed boat that was heading to Mokowe from Lamu Island. The second boat only had the coxswain on board who escaped unhurt. The accident occurred at Mnazi Mmoja near Wiyoni beach at around 7pm. Witnesses reported that both boats were at high speed at the time of the accident. It’s also believed the accident would have been partly caused by darkness since none of the two vessels had their navigation lights on. None of the boats capsized as has been the history with similar incidents at sea where vessels sink after colliding. Francis Mugo, who helped rescue and rush the injured to hospital, said the accident was partly caused by carelessness. “We are glad there were no casualties. The doctor says those injured are out of danger. We hope there will no future incidents as this,” said Mugo. Lamu County Commissioner Irungu Macharia urged boat operators to stick to and observe all the maritime rules to avert disasters.
