A Scottish judge has dismissed a move to force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to seek to delay the UK's departure from the EU. Lord Pentland had been asked to consider the effects of the Benn Act. The legislation was passed by MPs with the intention of preventing the UK leaving the European Union without a deal on 31 October. It requires the prime minister to send a letter to the EU formally requesting an extension to the Brexit timetable. In his ruling, Lord Pentland said: "There can be no doubt that the first respondent [the PM's legal team] now accepts that he must comply with the requirements of the 2019 Act and has affirmed that he intends to do so." He added: "I approach matters on the basis that it would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the Crown for the prime minister or the government to renege on what they have assured the court that the prime minister intends to do." One of the petitioners, Jo Maugham QC, said the decision would be appealed. Shortly after the ruling was publicly released, he tweeted: "There are now risks of an unlawful Brexit that would not, had the decision gone the other way, have existed."
