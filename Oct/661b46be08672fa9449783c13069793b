Tanzanian video vixen-cum-singer Hamisa Mobetto is not in good terms with award-winning star Nandy. Speaking to radio presenter Lilommy, Hamisa said the 'Ninogeshe' hitmaker had blocked her after a disagreement. "I don't think we should talk about her. She has blocked me," Hamisa said. "It's better not to talk about her because there are more important things to talk about. She is doing good, I'm doing even better. "I don't hold any grudges and I'm a person who moves on too fast. I have such a big heart and that's why I'm being successful." Hamisa is currently promoting her new song, 'Sensema', featuring Whozu. She is also planning collaborations with Kenyan artistes. "We spoke about a collabo with Sauti Sol. It will be good and I also have a song with another Kenyan artiste," she said.
