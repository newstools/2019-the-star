Petroleum CS John Munyes has once again extended the contract of the acting MD of the troubled Kenya Pipeline Corporation. In a statement on Friday, Munya said Hudson Andambi will continue to perform his roles until a substantive office holder is recruited. The CS said he made the decision after consultations with the KPC board. The extension will give the board enough time to complete the ongoing recruitment process. “During the tenure of Andambi, KPC has made tremendous progress in enhanced revenue collection. The company has also put in place measures to streamline the procurement process and restructuring of the company human resource,” Munya said in the statement. The CS urged the board to support Andambi to propel the company to greater heights. This was the second time the CS was extending the acting MD's contract. Andambi's term was initially supposed to expire on April 6, but the CS in consultation with board chairman John Ngumi extended his contract by six months. The extension was supposed to expire on Sunday. Andambi replaced Joe Sang who was hauled out of office in December last year over corruption allegations. Sang and four other officials of the company were charged with economic crimes after investigations linked them to corruption in the construction of the 1.8 billion Kisumu oil jetty.
