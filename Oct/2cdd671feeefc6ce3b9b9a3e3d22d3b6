After missing out on a trip to the ongoing World Championships despite winning the national trials, Daniel Simiyu continued with his rich vein of vein to clinch the Eldoret Family Bank Half Marathon title in Eldoret yesterday. Fresh from winning Kisii 10km road race, Simiyu and Tobong’lore Half Marathon winner Nancy Jelagat were a cut above the rest as they tore apart the opposition in the punishing conditions. And for the first time, Simiyu underwent an anti-doping test, which was part of the reasons he missed out on a debut at the global championships. Simiyu said the back-to-back wins on the road was a good consolation after missing out on Doha. “My focus has now shifted to the 2020 Olympic Games. Failure to get tested was not my problem since I cannot call ADAK to come to test me,” lamented Simiyu. Simiyu is also planning to compete at the Standard Chartered Half Marathon later this month. “The race was tough but I gave it my all. I missed out on Team Kenya but that is a non-issue now since I have set my focus on the races ahead of me,” said Simiyu, who has been dominating Kenyan road and track races. He won the title in 1:03:00, edging out Moses Kibet (1:03:38) as Andrew Kipkemboi closed the podium places in 1:03:44. Jelagat, the Kitui Half marathon champion, who has also been running well locally stunned her opponents to win the title in 1:12:04 ahead of Deborah Sumum (1:12:45) and Marion Kibor (1:15:05). Jelagat will also be chasing the Standard Chartered Half Marathon title later this month. “I have been training well for this race and the right time has come for me to compete at the lucrative Chartered Half Marathon,” said Jelagat, who trains in Iten, Elgeyo Marakwet County.
