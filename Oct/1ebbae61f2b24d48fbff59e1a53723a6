Kenyatta University has been closed following student unrest which started on Monday and heightened on Tuesday. The university, through an internal memo, said the disturbances disrupted lectures and led to destruction of property. "The University Senate has decided to close the University until further notice. In view of the foregoing, all students are required to vacate the University premises immediately," vice chancellor Paul Wainaina said. On Monday, the Kenyatta University Students Association president Joshua Ayika shared a Memo, calling for peaceful demonstrations against the administration. The administrationâ€™s alleged refusal to extend fee payment, suspension of students and student leaders on a 'petty' basis, charge on supplementary exams and the alleged sacking of more than 700 casual workers without notice are some of the complaints. The students also complained about an increase in fees. They claimed that the graduation fee had abruptly risen from Sh3,500 to Sh6,000. On Monday, Kusa Secretary General Fred Changulo apologised for the disruption. "We would like to apologise to the general public and the university community for the unfortunate events that happened today (Monday) at our university that almost disrupted the smooth running of the university," he said. In what appeared to be apparent within the student union, Changulo accused "a few disgruntled fellows with unknown personal intentions"of invadingthe university and causing a disturbance. "We would, however, like to re-affirm to the public our commitment to jealously guard the rights of our peace-loving students," he said. Changulo said the student leadership had engaged the management and discussed the issues. "Key to note is the fee deadline extension which we have successfully negotiated and the management will communicate the details soonest." Changulo said he was hopeful that the other issues would be considered and communication made early.
