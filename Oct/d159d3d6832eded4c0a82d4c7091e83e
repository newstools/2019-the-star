Donkeys loitering in Lamu town will be impounded and their owners fined Sh1,000, county Public Health chief officer Abubakar Badawy has said. The historical town and Unesco heritage site has for decades been beset with waste collection and disposal problems. Donkeys are a greatly valued resource in the town, but they litter the narrow streets with their waste. The beasts eat at dumpsites and from bins along the streets, spewing garbage and posing health problems. Badawy said in Lamu town on Monday that his office was awaiting the approval of the decision from the county assembly. A facility will be set up from where impounded donkeys will be held, fed and treated until the owners show up with the Sh1,000 fines. The holding facility will be at Kibaki grounds. Badawy accused some residents of not wanting to feed their donkeys, letting them loose to look for food. “This is a heritage site and there is a need to keep it in a particular way. The major challenge we have with keeping the town clean is the loitering donkeys that leave a trail of waste wherever they go.” The fines and other costs are meant to teach people to be responsible for their animals. Donkey owners said the fine was unfair and should be reduced to Sh500. “You can’t tie a donkey down like you would a dog or a cow. They are different. If they must fine us, let it be Sh500 not sh1,000,” Abdi Shukri said. Most of the residents said the fines and other rules will help improve cleanliness in the town. “Some donkey owners are just arrogant and disrespectful. This will help instil discipline and a sense of responsibility,” Omar Kashata said.
