Boris Johnson has said he will press on "undaunted" with his Brexit strategy despite losing a vital vote in the House of Commons. He has vowed to introduce legislation needed to implement his agreement in Parliament next week. But he will be compelled later to ask the EU for an extension beyond 31 October after MPs backed a motion designed to rule out a no-deal exit. And the PM was forced to shelve a decisive vote on his agreement.
