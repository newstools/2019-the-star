A crackdown on drug dens in Wajir to be led by county commissioner Loyford Kibaara is among a raft of measures put in place to rid the county of narcotics. Empowerment programmes will also be initiated to keep youth off drugs and substance abuse.  Bhang, codeine and miraa are among the most abused drugs in the region. These measures were agreed on at a meeting to counter drug and substance abuse on Saturday. It was attended by leaders from both levels of government. The governor was represented by his deputy Ahmed Ali. The meeting also resolved to implement assigned activities as per the Nacada Conference Action plan signed on September 4 in Wajir town. As part of the plans, a peaceful public procession involving all stakeholders will take place after the KCPE exams culminating in a public baraza on November 30. Kibaara said that the fight against narcotics must be sustained because drugs use is a big contributor to some of the ills bedevilling society. “This is not a fight we can ill afford to lose. Giving up means we have decided to lose a whole generation and the society which largely consist of young people,” he said. Kibaraa said that a lot of progress has already been made in the fight since the creation of the Wajir regeneration group to counter drugs abuse. Several people involved in the business have since been arrested and vehicles carrying drugs impounded. Ali said that the county will continue working closely with the national government to develop programmes that will sensitise the residents and keep them engaged.
