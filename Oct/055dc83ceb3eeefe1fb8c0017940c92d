What was meant to be a normal fishing expedition for twins took a turn for the worse after their boat capsized in Watamu Beach, Kilifi county, on Wednesday. The two, with other two fishermen, had set off for the deep seas in the Indian Ocean when strong winds struck, capsizing their boat. The two fishermen swam to safety while one of the twins was rescued after two hours and taken to Malindi Subcounty Hospital, where he died while undergoing treatment. The body of the other twin was retrieved at 5pm and burial preparations are underway. Confirming the incident, Malindi Subcounty Police Commander Philip Wambugu said fishermen should study tides before going to sea. "Many fisherman have been in fishing for long and they should not take precautions for granted because they have experience," he said.
