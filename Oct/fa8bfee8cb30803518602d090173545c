Munira, a Kenyan woman, says she will stop at nothing until Tanzanian singer Mbosso loves her back. The Mombasa resident went to Tanzania, where she camped for days outside Wasafi offices. “I love him. There are so many men in Kenya that want to marry me but I’m not ready. I came to look for Mbosso and I’m ready to do anything,” Munira said in an interview with Wasafi on Friday. "I love him so much. I loved him since Yamoto Band. I sold my phone to get fare to come to Tanzania." Adding, "Mbosso, if you will not accept me, I’m ready to take poison so that I don’t live. And if you accept me, I will raise all your kids, I’ll do whatever you want. I only love you and you alone." She says the singer insisted she goes back home but she is not of the same opinion. "I finally met him and he told me he’ll give me fare to go back home. However, I’m not ready to go back. He gave me TSh10,000." When asked about the issue, Mbosso says he has already settled down with his baby mama. "I cannot blame her for that. But I have a family and kids and I have a lot," he said. "Getting into a relationship with someone from nowhere I can say is just stupidity. I want her to go back home."
