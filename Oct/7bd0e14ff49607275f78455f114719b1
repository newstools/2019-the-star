Defending champions Nairobi Water will miss the services of reliable center back Michelle Adhiambo and goalkeeper Winnie Miyenda for the better part of the ongoing Kenya Handball Federation national league season. The duo is suffering from knee injuries sustained gradually over a series of games. Despite no specific return date, coach Jack Ochieng is confident in his fringe players will step up to the challenege. “Injuries have laid off one of my best players, Michelle Adhiambo and goalkeeper Winnie Migenda. I cannot give a time frame for when they will be back but it will take longer because I need them to be fully before they return to action. However, I have sufficient cover in their positions,” said Ochieng. Melvin Akinyi and Brenda Sambai are among those who will be expected to step into Adhiambo's shoes whereas Eunice Oginga, who is back from maternity leave, will take Migenda's place in the goalkeeping area. The tactician alluded that he has utility players in his squad to look up to, which comes in handy for the team when hit by injuries. “I am very comfortable with the team at my disposal. Sambai is a utility player, and so is Melvin Akinyi. Both can fill in for Adhiambo. I make sure that my players master more than one position so that they can be able to trade places when need arises. Migenda will be assisted by Oginga who just returned from maternity leave. Therefore, I am not worried,” he said. Nairobi Water is looking to retain the league title this season and is prepared for stiff competition from rival teams. “Being the defending champions, I expect great competition from teams such as National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) and Kenya Defence Forces (KDF), so it is inevitable that I will work my best to ensure I also take the win this season,” Nairobi Water will be up against Kenyatta University on October 13 at the Kaloleni handball court.
