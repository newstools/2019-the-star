Ugandan pop star and presidential aspirant Bobi Wine has tweeted a video showing him denouncing the government's ban of his trademark red beret for people who are not in the armed forces. A spokesman for Bobi Wine's People's Power Movement said the beret had been banned due to "fear" and "panic" from the government. In the video, which has an emotive marching beat as a soundtrack, the politician says the beret is a symbol of the "desire for change". The party insisted that the badge for the Uganda People's Defence Forces beret was different from their beret, which they call "a symbol of resistance". By wearing the beret, Ugandans are "not committing any crime," Bobi Wine insisted. A woman wearing the beret in the video said the headpiece is "a symbol of hope for so many Ugandan women, young and old, who cannot effectively participate in the democratic process of our country". Ugandan security personnel on Thursday detained six supporters of pop star and presidential hopeful Bobi Wine for wearing red berets, a banned symbol of his "People Power" pressure group, a spokesman for the movement said. Wine, 37, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has rattled the government since becoming a legislator in 2017 with a line in caustic criticism that has earned him growing support. His rising political ambitions and connection with young people via his music have provoked a clamp-down by the government, which has detained some of his supporters and teargassed his rallies.
