YouTuber Maureen Waititu quit her job after she gave birth to her second child. And looking back, she says she has no regrets. Speaking on her YouTube channel, she said, "I haven't tasted the fruits of influencing but it's better than working in an office. I quit my job three months after giving birth. So far it was the best decision I made. "But I quit in debt, in a place of I didn't know what I was gonna do next. Unfortunately. A mother's life revolves around constant worry." The mother of two says she took a break from law to look after her kids. "I'm a lawyer by profession but I do not practise. I took a sabbatical, which was deliberate, and was supposed to be between three to five years because children grow a strong bond with their mothers if they spend the first five years of their lives. I got another baby so my plan had increased with two years." Maureen hit the headlines in 2016 when she was featured as a video vixen in Nameless' song 'Inspire'. "It opened doors for me and I got messages from women saying I inspire them. Eventually, I made it work. I wanted to be open about a purpose, to motivate people," she said. "Motherhood is a 24-hour job; it's very difficult on some and easy for some. But if you are a career woman, you know, we live with guilt and not knowing if we are doing the right thing for our kids."
