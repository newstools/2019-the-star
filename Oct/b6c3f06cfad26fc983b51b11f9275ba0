A group of politicians from Northeastern Kenya may soon land in trouble. Sources whisper to Corridors that the DCI has been tying up evidence about alleged tampering with the Census. It is said that the politicians were involved in the manipulation to project the region as having huge numbers. Those in the know said a prominent politician and his wife are among those targeted. It is only a matter of time before the chickens come home to roost as the Zachary Mwangi-led Kenya Bureau of Statistics analyses the data. Several chiefs arrested during the exercise are said to have spilt the beans on who was bankrolling them.   An MP known for stinginess is the latest topic within the corridors of a high-rise building where his law firm is located. The lawyer-cum-politician has failed to allow office administrators to replace old sofas in the office. A client recently jumped off the leather couch and hurt his head after a well-fed rat scampered under his feet. The client complained the law office has the oldest seats in town despite the politician being a seasoned Nairobi lawyer. The seats said to have been bought in the late 1990s are also said to be infested by bedbugs and cockroaches that area discomfort to clients. Only the politician's private office has modern furniture. Is Vigilance House aware of a police cartel terrorising residents in Githurai? The officers who operate under the cover of darkness have been demanding protection from business owners in the area. While it is illegal for officers to solicit money from hapless Kenyans whom they swore to protect, these officers are unashamed. On Saturday, they arrived in a much bigger contingent to 'patrol' the area in large groups. They were demanding Sh100 each from shop and bar patrons. A standoff ensued when some bar patrons refused to part with the money. But determined officers keen on the loot later arrested a man and framed him for resisting arrest. How much longer will innocent people suffer?
