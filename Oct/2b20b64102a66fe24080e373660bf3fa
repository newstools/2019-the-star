The operation to recover two bodies after a vehicle plunged into the Indian Ocean came to a close on Tuesday evening with no results. Mariam Kighenda and her four-year-old daughter, Amanda Mutheu died after their car slithered from a ferry into the Indian Ocean. They were coming from a shamba trip in Kwale. The recovery exercise started early in the day, led by the team comprising of officials from the Kenya Navy, KPA, Kenya Fisheries Research Institute and Private Contracted Divers. The Kenya Ferry Services has said normal ferry services in Likoni will be paralysed between 9am and 11am on Wednesday to allow the rescue team to continue the operation.
