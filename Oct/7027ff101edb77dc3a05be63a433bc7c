Thika residents have called on the Ministry of Water to ensure they get water from the Kariminu II dam that is under construction in Gatundu North. The locals led by area MP Patrick Wainaina claim that they have been left out of the initial supply design from the Sh24 billion dam. Wainaina told journalists in Thika town that he has discovered that the dam is designed to supply only Juja, Ruiru, Gatundu and some parts of Nairobi. The lawmaker said that demand for water has skyrocketed in Thika due to a high population and the many industries operating in the region. “The region is currently relying on a water system that was put up over 50 years ago and that cannot satisfy the demand for water,” the MP said. Wainaina said that he is in talks with the Water ministry and Athi Water Services Board to have Thika included in the water supply plan. He said that this will help address the water shortage that is currently experienced by residents and investors in the region. The lawmaker said that there are funds to construct a treatment plan at Mary Hill area. Danish International Development Agency has availed the funds through Thika Water and Sewerage Company. “If the water is pumped to our treatment plant we will be able to supply it to all corners of Thika constituency,” he said. Locals pleaded with the government to consider supplying water to Thika. “If the government is keen on supporting the manufacturing industries it should supply Thika with the water,” Humphrey Njenga said. Water CS Simon Chelugui together with his Interior counterpart Fred Matiang’i toured the dam site on Thursday. The dam will be built on 600 acres of land. It is set to be completed by December 2020. Contract for the construction of the dam was signed in May 2017.
