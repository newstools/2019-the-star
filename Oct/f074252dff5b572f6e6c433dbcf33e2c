A total of 32 clubs from Makadara sub-branch of the Football Kenya Federation have a reason to smile as they received full sets of uniform and balls form the  National Government Development Fund. The clubs who take part in both federation leagues and the Extreme sponsored super eight leagues also had their affiliation fees totalling to 574,000 paid yesterday. Women Premier League high-flyers Makolanders, Division one outfit Buruburu Sports as well as fourth-tier club  Mbotela Kamaliza were among the clubs who benefited.  Others included  MASA, Jericho All Stars, Hakati, JASA Academy and Michezo Halisi. The clubs endorsed outgoing FKF Nairobi East branch vice-chairman George Onyango for the chairman’s position when the  FKF National and branch elections come up at the end of the year. “I am pleased that the clubs have seen me fit to go for the top seat in Nairobi East.  I have been at the federation and I will continue championing for their rights and success at the grass-roots,” said Onyango. The regional, county, sub-county and women league of the  Nairobi east branch kick off this weekend. Makadara MP and former AFC Leopards  secretary-general  regretted the  exit of sponsors  from football and  revealed that  he would be the first in line to support grass-roots football “Our youths only have sports to look forward to and with sponsors leaving the game due to various reasons, we as leaders should commit to supporting the talent at the lower levels in this challenging times,”he said.
