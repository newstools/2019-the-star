NCBA Loop recently partnered with Sauti Sol to encourage potential entrepreneurs to pursue their passions. Sauti Sol used their social media platforms to tell the story behind their music and how their passion grew into the success story they are today. As part of the interactive sessions, Sauti Sol held a full concert exclusively for NCBA loop customers at the Blue Door Club in Westlands, Nairobi. For Loop, the concert was an appreciation to customers for their loyalty and providing a platform for one-on-one engagement.
