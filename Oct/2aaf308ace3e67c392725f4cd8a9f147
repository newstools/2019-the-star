After teenager Anita Soina accused comedian Terrence Creative and his wife Milly Chebby of death threats and revenge porn, we reached out to Milly Chebby to hear her side of the story. She said we should call Anita, then hung up. We called but Anita was not picking. Speaking to YouTuber Edgar Obare earlier, Anita claimed that Milly Chebby threatened her life, saying she would send Mungiki to her doorstep. “I had to stop staying at my place alone. I either stay at my friend’s house or I lock myself in the house,” she said. She also accused Milly of posting, using pseudo accounts, a video of Anita taken secretly by Terrence as she was dressing. This was after Milly promised to post her nudes on social media. In the comments, Anita admitted to an affair with Terrence, saying she loved him. "I'm sorry for letting down fellow ladies and I am not sorry for speaking up," she said.
