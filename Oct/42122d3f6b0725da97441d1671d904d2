The National Cohesion and Integration Commission has established a unit to monitor hate speech on social media platforms. NCIC Director of Programmes and Technical Services Millicent Okach said the unit will trace and nab individuals using social media to spread hatred. She said the trend of using public rallies to spread hate speech is shifting to social media platforms which has necessitated the establishment of the unit. Speaking during a sensitization forum among young people in Murang’a on Thursday, she observed that the commission has instituted prosecution of some individuals. “We are working closely with the Office of Public Prosecutions and Communications Authority of Kenya to flag out individuals who are engaged in conversations likely to cause incitements that may spark conflicts through various social media platforms,” she said. Through the unit, Okach said, they will conduct investigations on social media conversations and present them to DPP for prosecution. The director said some individuals have been charged with spreading incitement and hate speech through Facebook and WhatsApp. “Through continuous monitoring the move has deterred the spread of hate speech through social media platforms, a trend which is common among young people,” she said.
