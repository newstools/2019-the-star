BY ROBERT OMOLLO @robertomollo3 The government has shut three private primary schools in Homa Bay for failing to adhere to safety standards. County commissioner Herman Shambi and the county director of Education Fredrick Kiiru on Wednesday gave the directive to Aniang and St Jude private schools in Karachuonyo constituency and Alpha Herima in Ndhiwa constituency. The 56 pupils at Aniang were transferred to Agoro Sare and Rawinji primary schools. St Jude had 11 pupils who were transferred to Kotieno Primary. Alpha Herima had 109 pupils. They will now school at Got Kojowi Primary. Shambi said the schools had poor infrastructure that exposes their children to risks. "We discovered that the pupils learn in unworthy classrooms. The general infrastructure is not recommended at all," he said. He said they could not wait for the October 25 deadline set by Education CS George Magoha to take action against the schools. They had to prevent disasters, he said. "We found the schools in too pathetic situations to wait until the deadline. We realised they were very risky for learning." The crackdown continues. "We'll publicise names of the unworthy schools in various notice boards in the county to prevent parents from being hoodwinked next year," Shambi said. Kiiru urged school owners to stop taking advantage of parents by admitting children to risky learning environments. "Let entrepreneurs who invest in schools stop being driven by the thirst for money. This can cause a catastrophe," he said. He said they will not stop closing schools with dangerous infrastructures. "Let people who want to run and operate schools comply with the law."
