A 26-year-old boda boda operator in Embu has been charged with  defiling a 14-year-old girl. Her mother allegedly chased her away for stealing Sh20. Lincoln Mukundi was arraigned before Embu resident magistrate Jean Ndengeri on Friday and was charged with having sexual intercourse with the under age girl. He was also charged with indecently touching the girl’s private parts while committing the offence on October 12 at Nembure in Embu West subcounty. The suspect denied the offences and sought to be released on bond and be supplied with copies of the charge sheet, witness statements and any other documents the state intended to use against him in the case. Ndengeri released Mukundi on Sh500, 000 bond and surety of a similar amount. The magistrate instructed that he be supplied with the documents and fixed mention of the case on November 6. The man could not afford the bond and was escorted to Embu remand prison. The prosecution said the girl’s mother found Sh20 she had in the house missing and suspected the daughter to have stolen it. She scolded her and sent her away. The mother reportedly told the girl to return only after getting the money or she would face unspecified consequences. The scared girl reportedly left home and met the boda boda rider who listened to her predicament. Mukundi is said to have offered to assist the girl on condition that she slept with him. The rider allegedly took her to his house for the night and in the morning left her as he to his business. Mukunid allegedly spent another night with the girl and the following morning dropped her near her home after giving her Sh20. But neighbours alerted the mother who was by  worried about her daughter's whereabouts. She was told the man drop the daughter near home and she reported the matter to the police.
