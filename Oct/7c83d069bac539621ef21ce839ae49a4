Despite a blistering start and leading the Kenya Premier League standings after four games, Western Stima coach Salim Babu is not getting carried away. Western Stima have collected eight points from four matches and seem to be gaining confidence with each passing day. They have won two and drawn the same number of games and are yet to lose. Babu who took the reigns towards the end of last season is targeting a top-eight finish in the first leg. “We had a thorough pre-season, recruited well and the players have seamlessly fitted in well. We’ve started strongly and we hope to continue that way. In the first part of the season, we want to be in the top eight before we can think of the title. “The tactician eyes defensive improvement—a department that was their main undoing last season as the team conceded 37 goals—ten more than they scored. They have already conceded three goals and scored five and Babu has admitted that his boys have work to do if they are to reach the required standards even though everything has worked out well for them so far. He continued: “We are supposed to concede few goals this season because of our strategy. Most of the time, we work on defending because we have good strikers who can get goals for us. It’s worrying we have already conceded three but I am certain the boys will upgrade at the back. The league is tough, teams are prepared and there’s a long way to go. “Stima’s ambitions will be put to test in the next couple of weeks as they face Ulinzi Stars, AFC Leopards, Bandari and Gor Mahia respectively.
