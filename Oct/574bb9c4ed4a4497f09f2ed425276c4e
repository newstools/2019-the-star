Strathmore University coach Peter Mwathi is looking to extend their winning streak in the ongoing national handball league when they face St Paul University this afternoon. Strathmore are currently fifth on the table, having won all their three games and Mwathi is hoping to maintain this momentum as they dig deeper into the season. He believes that remaining unbeaten will give them an upper hand in their quest to clinch the league title. “We are determined to win our forthcoming matches so that we do not destroy the pattern. It is important to keep winning until the last game. We have started this season well as compared to the previous,” he said. Despite some of his dependable players graduating and leaving the team, the veteran coach is confident of his remaining young charges. He commended them for doing their best to fit into the shoes of those who left. “My young players featured in some matches last season. By observing their colleagues mode of play, they are up to the task in doing what is required of them,” said Mwathi. He added that their new signings left-winger Durel Okinyi, Allan Simiyu and left-back John Sumare have had a good outing so far. “We meet St. Paul's in our opening match today and we are ready to give our best. Any team playing in the league is not to be underrated, therefore, we will have our best foot forward,” he observed.
