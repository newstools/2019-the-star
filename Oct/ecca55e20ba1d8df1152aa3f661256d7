High blood pressure is common among the elderly but now it's a plague among the youth. “Life has suddenly changed, with the youth also on the run to fend for their families or siblings, thus sparking tension which results in them developing high blood pressure at a tender age," Busia Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi said. He raised the problem the burial of Doreen Wamalwa, county coordinator of Amath (Academic model providing access to Healthcare). The burial was at Sigalame in Samia subcounty. As the country marks cancer month, Mulomi also called for concerted efforts to ensure screening for non-communicable diseases or NCDs, to detect them at early stages. They include high blood pressure and heart conditions. He also said diabetes, cancers of the cervix, breast, throat and prostate, are curable if detected early. Busia Hospice and Palliative Care founder Peris Wandera last week appealed to residents to seek cancer screening to save their lives. Peris, a retired nurse, said that of every 10 people who seek treatment in county hospitals, at least three of them are diagnosed with cancer. “This is a worrying trend that calls for concerted efforts,” she said. Stages 1 and 2 are manageable if detected early but not levels 3 and 4. The rapid increase in cancer cases is caused by lack of awareness, lack of laboratories for cancer screening and unhealthy lifestyles, such as smoking. (Edited by V. Graham)
