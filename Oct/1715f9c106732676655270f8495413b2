After making headlines for the wrong reasons this year, Rose Muhando is back with a new single called 'Yesu Karibu Kwangu'. She said after releasing the song, "Asanteni wapenzi watanzamaji, Mwenyezi Mungu awabariki pakubwa." Previously, she had released the song 'Kenya Ulindwe', a dedication to President Uhuru Kenyatta and the entire nation of Kenya for helping her when she was sick. About three months ago, Muhando was hospitalised. However, close friends and family didn’t reveal what she was ailing from. Before that, the Tanzanian singer went viral because of a video of her being prayed for by Pastor James Ng’ang’a of Neno Evangelism Centre. Muhando has this year also released numerous collabos with artistes including Kamba singer Stephen Kasolo.
