At least 190 needy Kenyan students have benefited from the Kenya Scholar Access Programme (Kensap) to study in top North American Universities since 2004. The students, who are picked annually across all the 47 counties, are given the full need-based financial aid packages at the universities. On Monday, Kensap co-founder John Manners said to date, more than 100 of the students are graduates. "So far, 16 have earned or are pursuing PhDs, as well as an additional 35 who have earned or are pursuing Masters or other advanced degrees,‚Äù Manners said. Manners said more than 50 alumni had returned to Kenya to work for multinational corporations, international NGOs, Kenyan companies or to develop their startups Kenyan undergraduates now outnumber those of any other African country on the North American campuses, said. Due to the success of Kenya's alumni scholars, Kensap Executive Director Alan Davidson said the country will play a leading role in African development in the coming decades. Each year, there are around 15 to 20 deserving Kenyan students selected by Kensap to be admitted to select universities in the United States and Canada. After an elaborate selection process, accepted students participate in two extended residential training sessions, which prepare them for the American Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and introduces them to the American university system with its complex application procedure. Kensap, through an annual budget of Sh15 million, has generated more than Sh5 billion in financial aid packages granted by the universities that scholars attend. Also part of the programme, Kensap works with about 30 companies based in Kenya who act as employment partners that hire graduates for internships and full-time positions. Maryanne Chege, a Kensap 2018 graduate of Harvard University, said the programme provided the guidance needed after graduation through the networks and career support system. Edited by R.Wamochie
