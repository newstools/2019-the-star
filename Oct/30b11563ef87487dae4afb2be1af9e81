Six directors in the boda boda trade within Marsabit county have been arrested for tax evasion amounting to Sh698 million. KRA investigation commissioner David Yego on Wednesday said the six were arrested after they failed to declare income earned for the period between  2016-19 from the returns filed on behalf of the company. Ali Dida,  Adan Ali, Kose Hirbo, Ibrahim  Hirbo, Wako  Hirbo and Abdullahi Jillo, all directors of Northern Auto Dealers Limited, have been buying and selling motorcycles within Moyale Town. "Despite making sales amounting to Sh 3,420,942,711 between 2016 and 2019, the business failed to declare the income earned and pay the requisite taxes for both VAT and Corporation Tax, " read the statement. The suspects are currently held at the Nyeri police station and will be charged at the Nyeri Law Courts on October 31. If convicted, the accused will be liable to a fine not exceeding Sh10 million or double the tax evaded, whichever is higher, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both. Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has aggressively embarked on eliminating tax evasion in the country. Several arrests and prosecutions have resulted in unearthing of over Sh60 billion worth of taxes evaded which KRA is in the process of recovering.
