President Uhuru Kenyatta has dismissed claims that he is being pressured by politicians. Speaking as he presided over the groundbreaking ceremony of Dongo Kundu Special Economic Zone in Mombasa on Friday, Uhuru dismissed an article published in one of the local dailies. “Lakini mkifikiria nina pressure ya hii masiasa yenu bure, shauri yenu. We are too busy working” Uhuru said. Translates to: "If you think that I am being pressured with your petty politics, that is your problem." Uhuru said he is racing against time to launch projects. The President said that his government will deliver services to all Kenyans without bias. During the launch of the SEZ, Uhuru said the locals will benefit from the project once it is completed. He said the main purpose of BBI is to unite Kenyans and to create an inclusive system where everyone will be part of the government. “You cannot be a united progressive country if certain people feel that they have been left out or are being left behind,” Uhuru said. He urged politicians to stop assuming BBI is meant to create positions for certain individuals. His remarks come as the country waits for BBI team report and its recommendations. During the commissioning of the Nairobi expressway on Wednesday, Uhuru said he is not after any position after his term comes to an end. "Mimi sitaki kazi. Mimi nimechoka. BBI ni kuhakikisha ya kuwa hakuna mKenya atamwaga damu katika nchi yetu," he said. This translates to: "I don't want any work, I am tired. BBI will ensure that Kenyans do not spill blood."
