Right groups Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have released two new reports warning about "the shrinking space for freedom of expression" in Tanzania. They say new laws passed since President John Magufuli came into power in 2015 have repressed reporting and restricted the work of media, non-governmental organisation, and opposition groups. The laws have led to the arrest of at least a dozen journalists and the closure, suspension or punitive fines for more than ten newspapers and radio stations on accusations ranging from publishing fake news to sedition. "As President Magufuli marks four years in office next month, he must carefully reflect on his government’s record of ruthlessly disembowelling the country’s human rights framework,” said Roland Ebole, Amnesty International Tanzania researcher, at an event in Kenya's capital, Nairobi. “His government must repeal all oppressive laws being used to clamp down on dissent, and urgently end human rights violations and abuses,” he added.
