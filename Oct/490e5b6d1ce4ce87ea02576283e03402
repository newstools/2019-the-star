Residents of Thome village in Eburru, Gilgil suffered losses after a dam burst on Sunday evening leaving behind a trail of destruction. Tens of families had their crops and livestock washed away by raging waters. The dam was under repair by a contractor hired by the county government when it burst. The area has now been hit by an acute water shortage with residents questioning the quality of the works being undertaken by the contractor. Lydia Nyota told the Star there was a loud bang then water flooded the area, missing several homes by few metres. She said that the dam had served them for years but had developed a leak before the contractor moved in to repair it. “We thank God that no lives were lost as the waters swept anything along its path.  We want urgent action taken as this is our only source of water,” she said. Gilgil subcounty commissioner Mutheki Ndambuki said engineers from the county government had been sent to assess the dam. Mutheki said no one was injured when the dam burst because residents had been warned of the repairs as one way of averting possible loss of lives. “We received information of a burst dam in the hilly areas of Eburru and we made every effort to ensure no one was affected. We have sent a technical team to check the situation,” he said. Eburru/Mbaruk ward MCA Samuel Kariuki downplayed the issue saying the contractor has been ordered to go back and redo the works he had started. “Although it’s a big loss to the community we are calling for patience as the contractor does the works afresh,” he said. On May 9, last year a dam at Patel farm in Solai burst its walls spewing millions of gallons of water through three villages downstream. The incident left 48 people dead.
