Rue Baby, Akothee's daughter, says she is yet to inform her mother that she entered the Miss Universe Kenya competition. Speaking to Word Is on Tuesday, Rue said, "Actually my mother doesn't know about this. I didn't tell her because I didn't know I was going to make it this far. I am waiting for a good day, when I'll sit her down and tell her that I've made it to this point." Rue tells cyberbullies to stop thinking that it is easy for her. "I have seen many negative comments, saying that it's my mother that got me into the competition. I have worked myself so hard and I'm also very competitive to get the crown. It is my hard work that has gotten me there. You see now my mother doesn't even know about this," she said. "If I had it easy, then I don't think I'd have conquered the challenges. I don't have it easy. It's very hard on my side. I have to go all out and be outstanding. She, however, adds that her mother has been supportive in her modelling career, "She will be very happy when I tell her the news." So, how did all this start? "I applied and I was called for auditions and later shortlisted, depending on how one performed. The 20 of us went for challenges in the following week.  The next step now is the boot camp and then the main event," she said. Rue added that, "I have really tried because the competition is very stiff, but it's a beautiful experience to interact with such models in the industry. I believe in God and I'm hoping to get to the final stage." Rue credits fashion personality Letoya Johnstone for helping her out. "Letoya took me in and taught me how to walk and pose. She is harsh in a very nice way, so that you get to learn. She can really walk the runway." Rue hopes to take the crown and says it has taken her humility, punctuality and hard work to get to where she is.
