President Uhuru Kenyatta and his foe turned friend, ODM leader Raila Odinga, have shown us that in politics you don’t need principles; only the interests matter. From last year’s passage of the Finance Bill raising taxes to last week’s raising of the country’s borrowing cap to Sh9 trillion, one thing has remained constant, ODM has portrayed itself as the single most important entity the President relied on to propel such unpopular bills. Forget the fact that it’s the same ODM that went round the country lampooning the jubilee government over its unbridled appetite for debts and overburdening citizens with high taxes. Today, because they feel they have been accommodated enough in the government, they sing the same songs they would not want to listen to a year or so ago, and their supporters are cheering them on. Save for ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi and at times Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula, the rest of the opposition are dancing to the horrible tunes they once said would plunge the country into an abyss. In fact, they are no longer surreptitious about it even if what they do goes against their well-known stances on major issues. DP William Ruto merely needs to propose to ODM an idea and the latter will quickly take the opposite direction without looking at its merits or otherwise. That’s how low we have sunk in this era of ‘peace through the handshake’. Nobody enjoys this political fluidity than Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko. Today he is ready to disobey court orders to keep away his perceived enemy, county speaker Beatrice Elachi, tomorrow he embraces her and is even believed to have hired goons to escort her to City Hall. With all these shenanigans, will Kenya meet greatness any time soon?  Economic and political analyst
