The family of former President Daniel Moi has said he is admitted in hospital and is alert and aware of his surroundings. Press secretary and family spokesman Lee Njiru in a statement on Tuesday said the family is displeased with the negative and alarmist reports being peddled around about Mzee Moi's health. Njiru said Mzee Moi is being attended to by a professional medical team, led by his personal physician Dr David Silverstein. "He is alert and conscious of his surroundings. The family is asking the media to, in this regard, publish only the medical bulletins issued through the legally established official channel," Njiru said. "The family is extremely thankful and grateful to all Kenyans and well wishers from abroad for their prayers and 'speedy recovery' messages." Njiru said Moi's family has noted with appreciation the immense interest his hospitalisation has generated. "This is informed by his considerable stature, both in Kenya and the international sphere," he said.
