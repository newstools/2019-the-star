 Budalang'i MP Raphael Wanjala has asked the national government to hasten the desilting of River Nzoia to prevent flooding. Some villages and farms have already been flooded following heavy rains in the highlands, including Mt Elgon. Wanjala has blamed the flooding on earthly materials, such as sand and mud, on the bed of a river. The MP spoke at Mulukoba Beach in Port Victoria after touring Sango Delta, Ndekwe, Bulwani, Obaro and Maduwa outlet canals in a survey to determine the cost and implementation of dredging works. Wanjala accompanied engineers from Jackie and Morgan from Mango Tree Marine Limited during the Thursday tour. He said the tour was carried out in consultation with Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. The lawmaker appealed to the government to speed up the de-silting of blocked rivers to save Budalangi residents from floods. He said the engineers would compile a report that would be forwarded to the national government. “There is flood threat in Budalang'i but once the blocked river beds are opened, then there will be no flooding,” Wanjala said. He said most schools in the constituency have been marooned by floodwaters. Meanwhile, residents especially those from the flood-prone areas of Bunyala South and Central have been urged to be on high alert as the levels of water in River Nzoia rise.  edited by peter obuya
