A man on Wednesday killed his wife and then took his life at Kithembe village, Kikunguni subcounty of Makueni. The 35-year-old allegedly hit his wife, 30, with a blunt object on the head and chest, causing her serious injuries. She died on the way to the hospital. Makueni county police commander Joseph Napeiyan said neighbours who responded to the woman's distress call found her lying on the floor in pain with head and chest injuries allegedly inflicted on her by the husband. "The neighbours reported to the police that they rushed to the homestead after they heard the woman scream and ask for help at 3 am. "They rushed her to Matungu Health Centre but she succumbed to the injuries on the way," Napeiyan said. The police boss said the husband disappeared after the incident. His body was later found hanging from a tree in a nearby bush. Area chief Ann Mwau said the man sent a text message to his brother informing him that he is going to take his life. She said the couple had lived peacefully but the act by the casual labourer at Malili area has left them with many questions. The couple is survived a seven-year-old girl. The bodies were taken Kilungu mortuary.
