Qualifying for next year's 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan is the immediate target of the 2019  Standard Chartered Marathon men’s champion Brimin Kipkorir. The Iten-based athlete reclaimed his 42km title yesterday in a time of 2.10:43 to walk home with Sh 2 million in prize money. Stephen Kipchirchir(2.11:53) and Victor Serem (2.12:00) finished second and third respectively as the 17th edition of the Standard Chartered Nairobi Marathon concluded yesterday at Nyayo Stadium. “I have been injured since April and I only resumed training in August. So to come here and win is a testament to the hard work I have put in prior to this race. I am now focused on preparing for the nationals where, hopefully, I will make the team to the Olympics,” said the 2017 Standard Chartered winner. Kipkorir took over control of the race after the 35km mark and never looked back,  romping home comfortably to be received at the Nyayo Stadium finishing line by the Sports Cabinet secretary Amina Mohammed and PS Peter Kaberia. “I was very comfortable with my finishing and that is why I decided to charge after 30km; well aware that my competitors could put up with my pace,” he rejoiced. The women race was easily won by Purity Jebichi in a time of 2.30:34—almost three minutes ahead of Chemtai Rionotukei (2.33:40) and Shelmita Muriuki (2.34:04), who placed second and third respectively. “I did not expect to win this race as I just resumed training a couple of months ago. I just wanted to test myself and now that I won, I want to fully venture into marathon racing,” said Purity. Like their male colleagues, the female marathoners also received similar prize money oof Sh2 million for the winner, Sh750,000 for the runners up and Sh500,000 for the third-placed finishers. Arguably, the star attraction was Daniel Simiyu who was competing in his second road race as he won the 10km event in a time of 28:22 minutes. Simiyu, who missed taking part in the World athletics championships in Doha despite finishing second the 5,000 meters race in the national trials,  said he remains committed to road racing and has put away his disappointment of missing out in the worlds. “Failing to go to Doha is all water under the bridge now for me. I have to look forward in my career in road racing where I hope to do well from now on,” he remarked. For his win, Simiyu was rewarded with Sh200,000. Second-placed Peter Muriuki (28.56) and Edwin Bett (29.6) pocketed 150,000 and Sh100,000  RESULTS 42 KM Men 1.Brimin Kipkorir (2.10:43) 2.Stephen Kipchirchir (2.11:53) 3.Victor Serem (2:12:00) 4.David Kiplimo (2:12:27) 5.Fredrick Murabula (2:12:40) 6.
