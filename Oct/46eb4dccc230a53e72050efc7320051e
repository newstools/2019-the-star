 The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital has waived the medical bill of a long-term patient and released him to a church NGO for care. CEO Wilson Aruasa said John Mwangi Chege was released to International Vision Centre on Tuesday. Chege had been in hospital since April 2016 when he was admitted. He was received at IVC by Bishop Joseph Likavo. Chege lost his entire family in the 2007-08 post-election violence. He was hospitalised for lung-related complications and was unable to leave the hospital due to his dependence on supplemental oxygen. Likavo said IVC will take care of Chege through their homecare. Chege is a member of the church. Likavo thanked MTRH for the care that his congregant received and for the waiver of the bill. The hospital board waived Sh30 million for patients who were unable to pay. Chege benefited from an Sh800,000 waiver.  edited by peter obuya
