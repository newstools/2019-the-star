A man, 20, has committed suicide after he was found living with a KCPE candidate who had gone missing for three days in Narok county. The girl went missing on Saturday. Residents and the girl's parents found the minor in the man's house on Monday in Ololulung`a area. “After the girl was found, angry residents wanted to lynch the suspect known as Emmanuel Bett, but he locked the house and hanged himself with a rope in the presence of the minor,” a resident who did not want to be named said. Narok South police boss Ezekiel Kiche on Tuesday confirmed the incident, saying they have started investigations into the matter. The body was taken to Narok County Referral Hospital mortuary. County Director of Education Philip Wambua warned those preying on schoolchildren that they will face the full force of the law. Wambua also cautioned schoolgirls to be wary of such predators. Cases of suicide are on the rise in Narok county and the country. On September 10, Kenya joined the world in marking World Suicide Prevention Day as grim statistics emerged on suicide cases in the country. According to available data, the number of suicides reported in Kenya rose by 58 per cent between 2008 and 2017. It has been reported that Kenya loses about 7,000 people to suicide-related deaths annually, 142,500 others being survivors of suicide. During this year’s Madaraka Day celebrations in Narok stadium, President Uhuru Kenyatta raised concerns about the rising cases of depression that have led to suicide, homicide and femicide. “I have noted with extreme sadness and concern the rise in cases of suicides and femicides. When you take away an innocent life, you not only end that life but also ruin your life in the process,” the head of state said. He urged employers and learning institutions to invest time and resources in monitoring and facilitating the mental well-being of people.
