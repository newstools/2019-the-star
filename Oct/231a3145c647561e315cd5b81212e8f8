Following the ongoing crackdown on schools, the future of many children is uncertain. The ministry is closing down schools that have not complied with regulations which exist to ensure the safety and quality education for learners. Some parents claim most of these unregistered schools offer quality education at a low cost hence, it is prudent for the government to know what goes on in their classrooms. The government should conduct this process in a way that those affected students have a guarantee of continuing with their education.  Mombasa
