Former Olympic Games 3,000m steeplechase champion Brimin Kipruto is confident Eliud Kipchoge will run faster than expected in today's INEOS 1:59 Challenge in Vienna, Austria Kipruto, who is one of the closest friends of Kipchoge, said the world record holder will run lower time than the prescribed 1:59 in today's race. “I believe Eliud will run 1:58 if his training regime for the past 10 months is anything to go by.  I have been training with him all this while and I know him better than anybody else,” said the former world 3,000m steeplechase champion. Kipruto, who trains alongside Kipchoge at Global Sports Communication in Kaptagat, Uasin Gishu County, said Kipchoge welcomed him at the camp in 2004 and from that time their friendship has grown from strength to strength. “I have known him for the last 16 years and he is one man who is very focused hence I see him going under 1:59,” said Kipruto, who is also the 2010 Commonwealth Games 3,000m steeplechase silver medallist. Before Kipchoge left for Vienna, Kipruto said they had a lengthy conversation, which he believes will work for him. “Our discussion revolved around the INEOS 1:59 Challenge and I have confidence he will achieve his target. I was among the last people he talked to before jetting out of Eldoret International Airport and I believe the sky is the limit,” added Kipruto, who has quit track for road races. Kipruto has had successful track events, winning Olympic 3000m steeplechase gold at 2008 in Beijing, China after settling for silver in Athens 2004. He went ahead to win gold at world championships in Osaka in 2007 followed by silver in 2011 and bronze at both the 2005 and 2015 championships
