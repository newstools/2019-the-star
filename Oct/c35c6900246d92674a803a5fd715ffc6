Only two passengers were slightly injured when Silverstone Air skid off Wilson Airport, KAA has said. Kenya Airports Authority on Friday said the two are receiving medical attention at the facility. "The aircraft is carrying out investigations to establish the cause of the incident," KAA said in a statement. Kenya Red Cross said those who sustained multiple injuries were evacuated to nearby hospitals. "...those with soft tissue injuries are receiving treatment by EMS at Silverstone offices," KRC said. Red Cross has set up a psychosocial support desk at Wilson to help the victims. The plane which had 50 passengers, skid off Wilson Airport as it prepared to take off to Lamu. Images from the scene showed that the Fokker 50 aircraft plunged into a thicket, hitting some trees and breaking part of its wing, before being grounded, tilted to one side. The Fokker 50 is a turboprop-powered airliner, designed as a refinement of and successor to the highly successful Fokker F27 Friendship.
