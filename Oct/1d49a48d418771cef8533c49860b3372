Kakamega has embarked on an enhancement of a child-friendly learning environment at the ECDE level. Speaking during the launch of Sh50 million worth ECDE furniture for the 12 Kakamega Sub-counties at Bukhungu on Friday, Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said his government has already disbursed Sh117 Million to ensure that 12,329 children learn in a child-friendly environment with requisite materials. "Our assessment of the status of the prevailing ECDE learning environment revealed serious challenges existed in the provision of quality low-cost and appropriate furniture for children. It is against this background that the county government made adequate provisions in the budget for the purchase of suitable furniture for ECDE centres across all the sub-counties, Oparanya added. The county chief said his government had spent Sh50 million to procure furniture in 334 ECDE centres and a further Sh50 million has been allocated for more purchases. He also said the county government had entered an agreement with the Kenya Literature Bureau to print, publish and brand teaching and learning materials to be published in all ECDE centres in the county at the cost of over Sh34 million.
