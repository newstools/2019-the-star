 Two women and a man were on Wednesday charged in a Kiambu court with masquerading as legal practitioners. Patrick Kirega Gathona, Rhoda Nyawira Wangari and Teresia Wanjiku Kirori appeared before senior resident magistrate W. O. Rading where they denied charges of masquerading as advocates. The prosecution the accused were found practising as advocates on September 27 in contravention of the law. The offences were committed at Mwaniki Warema and Co-Advocates offices and Joyparty Property offices in Ndumberi and at Maina Gachihi and Co-Advocates Â in Kiambu. The suspects were granted a bail of Sh30,000 each pending the hearing of the case on November 5. Detectives have advised the public to conduct due diligence on those they approach for legal services to establish if they are conmen. They said quacks masquerading as advocates of the High Court were roaming all over the country to defrauding unsuspecting members of the public. An Embu elder, jailed last week for three years for impersonation, joins a growing list of impostors who have infiltrated the legal profession. Courts often render null and void decisions reached in cases where lawyers are discovered to have been masqueraders. Former Law Society of Kenya president Isaac Okero admitted in 2017 that the issue of fake lawyers was real and a big challenge to the profession.  edited by peter obuya
