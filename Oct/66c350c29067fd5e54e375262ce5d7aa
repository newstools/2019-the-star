Former Garissa county assembly minority leader Mohamed Sheikh Ali of ODM who lost his seat through a court petition but was re-elected has been sworn in. The seat was declared vacant after a bruising legal battle that went through to the Court of Appeal. Hundreds of his supporters jammed the assembly’s public gallery while others danced outside chambers. Speaking after being sworn in, Ali said the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga played a crucial role in his re-election. “I will ensure that our government provides decent healthcare, schools and clean and adequate water for all.  This is what my leadership endeavours to achieve,” Ali told his jubilant supporters. He called on his fellow MCAs to remain steadfast and play their roles in oversight, representation and legislation roles to the best of their abilities. “It will be unfortunate if as the assembly we fail in our roles. Failing means we have failed our electorate and our county. Let us remain committed in doing what we were elected to do,” he said. His colleagues congratulated him, saying he sailed through because of handshake as he got support from across the political divide. “It was a tall order seeking a fresh mandate from the people but you managed, first, because your electorate believed in your leadership and, second,  because of the handshake. In the  house we missed you contributions, welcome back ,” leader of majority Mohamed Gabow said.
