Diamond Platnumz, who is also known by the name “Simba”, says he admires the qualities of the polygamous animal. “Not every time I take photos at the hotel with slay queens... A lion has many qualities like having two to three wives. He is kind but when you mess with him, you are finished,” told the press at an animal park in Tanzania last week. It is not the first time Diamond has hinted at wanting to have many wives. Last year, he said in an interview that his religion (Muslim) allows him to marry up to four wives, and he is up to the task. The singer has publicly been involved with many celebrity women, namely Zari Hassan, Hamisa, Jacqueline Wolper, Wema Sepetu, Lulu Diva and now Tanasha Donna.
