A domestic quarrel ended tragically after a 39-year-old woman allegedly stabbed and killed her 19-year-old husband in Naivasha on Mashujaa Day. The teenager, who is a fisherman in Lake Naivasha, died at Kasarani estate before he could be taken to hospital. Neighbour John Ouma said the two have been cohabiting for a year despite questions being raised over their age difference. “They have in the past fought but today the woman grabbed a knife and stabbed her husband in the chest. He died before he could be taken to hospital,” he said. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru confirmed the incident, saying the suspect was being held at Naivasha police station. She will be arraigned on Tuesday for murder. He said initial investigations pointed to murder. The police boss said officers had recovered the knife used in the attack and recorded a statement from the suspect. “The body has been collected and taken to the mortuary while the suspect will be arraigned in court on Tuesday with murder charges,” he said. Meanwhile, transport on several roads in Naivasha has been disrupted following the ongoing rains that have been pounding the lakeside town. The most affected are rural roads, with the dilapidated Moi South Lake Road being the hardest-hit. Motorist James Mwangi said they were going through untold suffering every day as they navigate through the road. “We are asking the government to move with haste and repair this road as it is causing us major losses every day,” he said. Earlier in the month, Transport CS James Macharia had promised that a contractor would be on site within a week to repair the road .
