UAP Old Mutual and The Estée Lauder Companies partnered in October to raise awareness on breast cancer. The UAP Old Mutual Tower has been lit up in pink for the entire month. The company has also supported the campaign by The Estée Lauder Companies to encourage people worldwide to take action in the fight against breast cancer. The tower was among landmark buildings and monuments around the world that have been lit up in pink in October, such as the Empire State Building in New York City, the Eiffel Tower in Paris and Tel Aviv Ferris Wheel in Israel. The campaign culminated with a fundraiser on October 26 called the Power of Pink Luncheon, which raised funds towards fighting breast cancer.
