Gospel artiste Betty Bayo has opened up about her battle with depression. The ex-wife of Pastor Victor Kanyari addressed the issue on her new YouTube channel last week. "Someone might ask if I have ever been depressed and yes, I have. I knew I was depressed after I attended a wedding only to realise that I had worn slippers. I had not combed my hair nor had I applied lotion on myself," she said. "In my mind, I knew that before I left home I had planned on attending a wedding, but I did not plan on attending while looking unkempt." Thankfully, Betty has since overcome her depression. "With time, I will open up on what drove me there in the first place and how I overcame that phase," she said. "When you are depressed, you feel like you are psychologically trapped. A bad relationship is a major cause of depression. "When a depressed person comes into contact with other people, they become too paranoid. When people talk and laugh, they tend to think they are the topic of discussion." In a past interview with Word Is, Kanyari said he and Bayo are co-parenting well, rubbishing claims on social media that he had abandoned his kids. "When I get time to talk to my children about life issues, I do, and if I donâ€™t get that chance, I always talk to God. I tell him to stand with my children. He will protect your children if you are a righteous person," he said. "Betty has never denied me a chance to see my kids. Even if I wanted to see them now I can. She is a good woman and a good mother." The once-upon-a-time lovebirds got married in 2012 at a private wedding, but they separated three years later.
