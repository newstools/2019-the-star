The Meru county government has started distribution of avocado, macadamia and banana seedlings worth Sh109 million to farmers to improve food security. “My top priority is food security. You cannot do anything on an empty stomach. You can’t even teach when hungry. We must have enough food,” Governor Kiraitu Murungi said. He said in three years Meru will have enough food and there will be no need for famine relief. “In three years there will be no relief food coming to Meru. You will never ask for food,” he said. He urged farmers to practice crop diversification to as a way to deal with failure of of crops and lack of ready markets. “I didn’t say people should uproot miraa but we should add more. Within your miraa farm find a corner to plant macadamia and avocados," he said The governor addressed farmers groups at Thiiri centre in Imenti North during issuance of cheques. His administration has partnership with the World Bank's National Agriculture & Rural Inclusive Growth Project (NARIGP) to fund the project. Kiraitu said that his government will initiate another agricultural program for youths to create employment. Deputy Governor, Titus Ntuchiu cautioned farmers against harvesting premature crops, sprayed fruits and vegetables which makes consumers susceptible to cancer. Agriculture executive Carol Mutiga said the program targets youth and other marginalized groups through sustainable agricultural productivity and profitability across the county.
