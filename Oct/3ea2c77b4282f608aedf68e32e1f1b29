Kisii University stepped up their preparations for the Kenya Universities Sports Association games scheduled for this weekend with a 4-2 win over National Super League side Shabana yesterday morning. Hosts Kisii University,  coached by Elijah Onsika, scored through Kepher Ogato and Samuel Melau who grabbed a brace each with Shabana replying through John Musyoka who also scored a brace. Kisii University were using the game to prepare for this weekend’s Western Conference KUSA games at Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST). “This game has helped me gauge my team ahead of the KUSA games where we will be making our debut in soccer,” said Onsika. He added that the team will fight it out for the soccer title. “We intensified our preps after winning Cluster Three title. The players are ready for the challenge,” added the former international. Kisii defeated Rongo University 2-0 and Tom Mboya University 1-0 to lift the Cluster Three title last weekend. Onsika, a retired striker, thanked the institution’s Vice Chancellor John Akama for supporting the team. According to Kusa Western Conference secretary general, Abraham Ong’onga, said the event will also feature netball, hockey, darts, table tennis and rugby 7’s. “Previously, we used to have rugby 10’s but we have decided to introduce 7’s because it’s more appealing,” said Ong’onga. MMUST, the defending 10’s champions will be seeking to win the 7’s title while Kisii will be hoping to retain the men’s and women’s darts titles.
