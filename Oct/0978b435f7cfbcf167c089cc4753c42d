Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga has urged Narok county assembly to rename Narok stadium after the late prominent politician William ole Ntimama. Raila praised Ntimama's efforts to unite and defend the Maasai. “I will ask all the members of Narok county assembly to pass a law that the stadium changes its name to Ntimama because of the role he played in fighting for the Maasai community,” he said. The ODM leader spoke during the burial of former Transport and Licensing Board chairman Hassan ole Kamwaro at Eor Enkitok home in Narok county on Saturday. He was responding to a request by Ntimama’s daughter Lydia, who asked the former premier to intervene so that the stadium is renamed in honour of the former Narok North MP. “During my dad's funeral and memorial, when the late Kamwaro was tasked to oversee our family after Ntimama left, there was a request that stadium be called Ole Ntimama but since that time to date nothing has been done,” Lydia said. The former nominated councilor said her father was the undisputed king of Maa community and his efforts deserved to be recognized and honour by having the facility after him. She said other regions have stadiums named after their heroes and that should also happen in Narok. Three months ago, ODM nominated MCA Christine Lemein sponsored a private motion on change of names. The matter was committed to the Justice and Legal affairs committee for discussion and public participation.
