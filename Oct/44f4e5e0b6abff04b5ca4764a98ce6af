A delegation led by Mohamed Hamdan "Hemeti" Dagolo, a senior member of Sudan's ruling Transitional Sovereign Council, is in the South Sudanese capital, Juba, for talks with rebel groups operating in Sudan. The talks were set to open on Monday after South Sudan President Salva Kiir invited both sides. The talks between the transitional government and the Sudanese Revolutionary Front are aimed at convincing rebel groups that have been fighting the government army in the Blue Nile, South Kordofan and Darfur regions to join the Sudanese political process. Sudan's Transitional Sovereign Council leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan will attend the opening session of the talks along with the leaders of Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda, according to a South Sudanese official. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has also been invited to the talks.
