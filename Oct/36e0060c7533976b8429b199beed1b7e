Betty Kyallo is not about to get pregnant any time soon. The TV personality received congratulatory messages from her fans after she was spotted with a fuller waist while interviewing one of her guests. Betty broke the news to her ‘Instagram in-laws’ who have been hoping she would have a child with her new beau. She posted, “Dope girl in the building! Missed being on-air, aki mko sawa? Ati I hear I’m expectant... Woi. I’m only expecting a good time tonight.” Betty said her daughter Ivanna would not agree to a sibling. “Na hata Ivanna hawezi kubali.
