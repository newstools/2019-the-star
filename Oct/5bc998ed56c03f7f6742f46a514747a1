Over 10,000 youths are expected at the launch of One Love Kenya's 'Tujitume', campaign at Kiboro grounds, Mathare. The campaign will be led by the legendary Wyre, among other Kenyan celebrities, such as DJ Shiti, Hopekid, Mr Seed and JFam. It is an organisation which tackles issues affecting the youth, such as corruption, drug abuse, radicalisation, violence, rape, tribalism and crime. The aim is to find lasting solutions to these problems. A football tournament will also be held, with the winner taking home a branded trophy and cash. 'Tujitume' is about getting up and going out there to do whatever you can to earn a living.
