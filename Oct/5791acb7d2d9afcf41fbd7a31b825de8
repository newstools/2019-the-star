Women across the country should fight for political positions with their male counterparts because they have the ability to lead, a woman rep has said. Catherine Wambilianga of Bungoma county said there are no positions that are the preserve of men. She said women should not be treated as lesser human beings in society. They are discriminated in appointments to senior positions. The woman rep spoke on Thursday at Kisii Sports Club during the annual AGM of Kuppet Kisii branch. “I am encouraging women across the country to rise up and fight for not only union positions but also political ones because they have what it takes to compete with their male counterparts,” Wambilianga said. Wambilianga who is the Kuppet national secretary for gender said they will not relent in fighting for implementation of the two-thirds gender rule. Kuppet secretary general Akello Misori, national chairman Omboko Milemba, vice chairman Julius Korir and treasurer Jenga Mbithi attended the function. Other senior officials present were national secretary tertiary Sammy Chelang'a, national secretary secondary Edward Obwocha and branch executive secretary Omari Otungu. “I am urging you my fellow women teachers to move a notch higher in seeking for national positions because if well represented our voices can be heard,” the unionist said. Bomet Central MP Ronal Tonui said Parliament will not support the Employment Act (Amendment) Bill 2019 because it is bad for employees. “We are not going to pass unfair labour laws. We are going to kill the bill,” Tonui said. The Bill proposes change of the definition of employee to exclude apprentices and learners. If it becomes law, trainees and interns will not be entitled to any employment benefits. Tonui who is also Kuppet national assistant treasurer said the drafter of the Bill was inconsiderate.
