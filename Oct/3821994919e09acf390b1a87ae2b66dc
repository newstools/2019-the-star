Kenya may be forced to trim the number of competitors they will send to the World English-Word Scrabble Players Association Championships set for between October 15 and 20 in Goa, India. Scrabble Kenya (SK) chairman Bernard Amuke intimated that they are waiting for communication from Kenya Pipeline Corporation on their position following team sponsorship talks between the two entities. Due to Kenya's good and improved team performance in 2017 in Nairobi, WESPA increased the country's quota by one to five slots. SK has listed an equal number of players including top seed Nderitu Gitonga, ace Allan Oyende, lawyer Bernard Koyyoko, dentist Patrick Litunya and Onani Magwanga for the showpiece. In the event that the oilers fail to fund the team, SK will be forced to send a leaner squad to India. “We are hopeful that Kenya Pipeline will confirm their sponsorship for the India-bound team. However, in the case that the deal fails, we will be forced to send three players only,” said Amuke who is meant to travel as team official. If the Kenya Pipeline deal does not come to fruition, and as agreed by SK membership, Gitonga, Oyende and retired teacher Onani will don the national colours at the Championships. During the 2017 WESPA Championships held in Nairobi, Oyende was the top placed Kenyan finishing position 25, while Gitonga was 33rd. The duo are ranked 123rd and 57th respectively as Onani 275th in the world. Five other Kenyans — Dr. Akinyi Wenwa, Fred Magu, Mwena Muumbi, John Sang and SK vice-chairman Kipkemoi Limo- have sponsored themselves to the world English-Word extravaganza. The quintet will compete in the side tournaments that will be happening concurrently with the Championships including First Gear and Last Chance qualifiers, The Goa One Day International, The Indian Open and Final Frenzy Pro-am.
