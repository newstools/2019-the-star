On Saturday, the duo held auditions to identify talents in Embu youth. Successful youths will be cast in a short film to begin their journey into the acting world. Speaking to journalists after holding auditions for the short film that will be shot in Embu, the thespians said talents help the youth earn an honest living and  participate in nation building. Murugi said the initiative will be a major boost in eliminating criminal activities and drug abuse in the county. She called on parents to allow their children to pursue careers of their choice and support them in pursuing their passion as a way of empowering the young generation. “Some children are born with diverse skills that if identified early and harnessed well, they can turn to be great sportsmen and artists of this county,” she said. Mugo said the youth should take acting seriously but balance it with education.
