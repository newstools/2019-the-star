The government on Wednesday night confirmed that the vehicle that plunged into the Indian Ocean on Sunday of September 29 has finally been spotted. The vehicle, a Toyota ISIS registration number KCB 289C, was seen some 58 metres deep in the Likoni channel. Goverment spokesperson, Col (Rtd) Cyrus Oguna said the operation to retrieve the body will start at 9am Thursday. "At around 3am, we had announced that we have seen an object that resembles a car. For several hours, we have been scanning the area and we have finally established that it is a vehicle. We have found the number is KCB 289C," said Oguna. He said this registration number is of the same vehicle that plunged into the Indian Ocean on September 29 with two occupants in it; Mariam Kighenda, a 35-year-old woman and her four-year-old daugher Amanda Mutheu. "We have confirmed through the underwater cameras that this is the same vehicle. However, we've not been able to ascertain if the bodies are still in the vehicle or not," said Oguna. He said they are however optimistic that the bodies will be found in the vehicle. "We have high hopes that the bodies will be found inside that vehicle. The operation to retrieve the vehicle will start at 9am on Thursday. Now, we cannot get into the ocean becuase it is already dark," said Oguna. The operation to retrieve the body had gone on for 10 days.
