Despite losing four key players,  Strathmore University men handball coach Peter Mwathi has challenged his boys to draw inspiration from their 2017 Kenya Handball Federation Super Cup triumph in the hunt for a first league title in a decade. The students have begun the season in typical fashion, winning their first three matches unlike last season when they lost their opening match against eventual winners NCPB — an outcome that denied them the much-coveted trophy even though they won all their remaining matches. Strathmore has gradually improved over the past few years. Prior to their second-place finish last season, they have been third for five years running. The men National team coach feels his charges have what it takes to break their trophy duck. He said: "We lost key players but those we have drafted in are equally good. With our gradual momentum, we can win it. The boys know it's an obligation they have to win especially with all our departments working well. Victory is vital owing to our great following. When we play, people keep track of Strathmore's performance.  With high expectations, we feel the time is now." Mwathi said he's not scared by the seasoned team's dominance. He wants the team to play according to his script offensively and defensively. "Our philosophy is to play with good defending. Defensive power makes you win the championship. We are also changing our way of shooting. The transition has been good and the culture fits all our players. Teams like NCPB and Black Mamba still have players who played 10 years ago but we are not disturbed. Our new ideas should work for us." Strathmore collected 44 points, one point less than winners NCPB who garnered 45. Currently, they are third with six points. With the team now converting chances, it remains to be seen what they can achieve this season.
