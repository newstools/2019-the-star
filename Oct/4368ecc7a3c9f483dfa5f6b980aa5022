Police in Kisii are investigating the reported assaults on four students by prefects at Cardinal Otunga High School in Mosocho, Kisii county. At least four students are reported to have suffered injuries and reported assaults to police. On Tuesday Kisii county commander Martin Kibet said, "I am aware of the issue and have ordered my offices to investigate the matter. We will find the answers to all those allegations." He said he would release details of the probe once police have completed investigations. School principal Chrispinus Owino and members of the board were in a daylong meeting on Tuesday discussing the matter and not available for comment. The students walked for more than seven kilometres from the school to  Gesonso police station, in Bonchari subcounty, to file their complaints. The students are said to have been assaulted on Saturday in what some parents said has become the norm. A parent whose son suffered a broken arm accused school management of lethargy and called for swift investigations to unearth problems at the extra-county school. He said cases of abuse are increasing at the school. “This is not the first time. We have heard of so many similar incidents that we have urged the management to address, in vain," he told the Star. He declined to be named for fear his child would be victimised. Kisii County Education Director Pius Kgoma told the Star by phone he has sent a team of officials to the school to undertake independent investigations. "We have launched our probe and will make make open the details once finished," he said. The officials have visited the school. He did not say when the probe might end. Principal Owino declined to speak to journalists when he was contacted by phone. He referred questions them to the subcounty Education director who was not available for comment. (Edited by V. Graham)
