People have been repaying Uwezo Fund loans using incorrect procedures making it difficult for the government to retrieve the money, Empowerment Centre manager Solomon Kasoa has said. A total of Sh2.5 million will remain dormant in bank accounts after depositing rules were flouted, disrupting the process of giving out loans in Matuga subcounty. Speaking on Tuesday in Kwale town during the disbursement of another Sh4.5 million to youth, women and persons living with disabilities, Kasoa said the majority of secretaries were depositing the funds using their names instead of the groups' icons as required by law. “It came to our attention that some group administrators actually used their names and information while repaying the money, which is against the loan and terms repayment procedures,” he said. Kasoa said the government will now have to find the depositors to verify their identities for the transactions for it to be granted access to the money. He said tracing back each person is cumbersome and time-wasting. The manager said the blunder has made more than eight groups miss out on the fund in this cycle. “As we are giving out this money today some have been left because of mistakes made by others and I fear it might take a lot of time to reclaim those funds." He said to avoid such incidences from reoccurring, he has advised both Ukunda and Kwale Equity Bank managers not to allow deposits from people who don’t know their groups’ names and code numbers. The government, Kasoa said, has come up with specific banking cards that entail all data about a certain group. More than 350 youth groups have benefited from the Uwezo Fund since its inception in 2015. Kasoa commended the active members who pay loans on time and encouraged others to emulate them. He also reminded politicians to keep off Uwezo Funds matters "because they have been at the forefront in discouraging youths from settling loan debts". Edited by R.Wamochie
