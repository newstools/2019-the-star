Deputy President William Ruto has told off critics over his involvement in the Sh5.3 billion Lower Nzoia irrigation project. A House team put Ruto on the spot for commissioning the 'empty' Lower Nzoia Irrigation Project without involving the parent ministries. On June 7, the DP went ahead to launch the irrigation project that cuts across Siaya and Busia counties at a time the line ministries claimed the whole project was a mere skeleton and not ready for the launch presided over by Ruto. The project is aimed at boosting rice production and preventing destructive floods. It covers Ugunja, Alego Usonga and Budalang’i constituencies. But on a tweet on Wednesday, Ruto said officials should stop plotting and involving themselves in 'raw' politics on the projects. "The launched lower Nzoia flood mitigation & irrigation project is now 15% in progress & is meant to eliminate destructive perennial flooding and increase acreage under irrigation," he said. Ruto added" I have followed this project since 2008 as minister for agriculture. Wacheni njama na siasa mbichi." Water Principal Secretary Joseph Irungu, in what seemed like a classic case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing, said the ministry was not aware of the DP’s plans. “Had I been asked, I would have said we hold on as we had not compensated anybody in Siaya and it was not proper to go on with the launch,” Irungu told the committee.
