Wheelchair tennis star Jane Ndenga spearheads Kenya's charge to the Puma Engineering Open slated for next week in Lagos, Nigeria. Ndenga will be accompanied by Asiya Sururu in the women's category with Peter Munuve, Rajab Abdalla and Collins Omondi taking care of the country's interest in the men's category. The five players have been training in Mombasa for the past fortnight and were confident of posting good results in the tournament.  Tennis Kenya (TK) administrator Nancy Nduku expressed confidence that the Ndenga will do the country proud. “They have been training in Mombasa to acclimatise to the hot and humid conditions currently being experienced in Nigeria. I expect the players to give a good account of themselves in the competition,” she noted. Kenya will be up against Nigeria, Ghana, Benin, Cameroon and Ivory Coast among other countries. The event has a total prize purse of Sh200,000. The team departs on Monday. Nduku said the sport is steadily growing in the country and expected the players to play for the country in the years to come. Elsewhere,  Ismael Changawa will lead Kevin Cheruiyot and Ibrahim Kibet to the Futures tennis tournament slated for Mozambique next month. The Futures tournament runs for three weeks and the trio will be hoping to for an improved performance after mixed results in Lagos a fortnight ago. The Kenyan players are using the event to prepare for the Davis Cup play-off match against Indonesia in March next year. Changawa, who missed the event in Nigeria due to a shoulder injury, hopes the players can rediscover form and go on a good run. "It will be good if we can get good results as this will boost our confidence for the Davis Cup."
