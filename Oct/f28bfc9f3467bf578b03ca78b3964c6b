MPs yesterday turned away Kenya Medical Supplies Agency bosses for submitting documents late in the Sh3 billion warehouse probe. Kemsa is in the process of coming up with its own store worth Sh3 billion in Nairobi’s Embakasi area and plans to give up its leased warehouse. The building of the Sh3 billion warehouse is meant to save the agency millions of money in rent payment. MPs had demanded all financial documents pertaining to the warehouse. The agency was directed to furnish the committee with documents on October 22 but only submitted them on Wednesday night. The submission was also done in tiny typefaces eliciting uproar from the lawmakers who complained they had difficulty in reading the documents. The lawmakers accused the agency of insubordination, demanding that Kemsa treat the House team with the seriousness it deserved. MPs Swarup Mishra (Kesses), Eseli Simiyu (Tongaren), Kipsengeret Koros (Sigowet-Soin) and Stephen Mule (Matungulu) read malice in how the agency is treating the committee. “If Kemsa received a letter from Parliament on October 15, what hindered them from providing all the required documents, this is an indication that they are not taking our work seriously,” Koros said. “I put on spectacles yet still I cannot read your documents, Kemsa team should be sent back and come back with all the facts presented in an organised manner, “We need all the documents. We don’t need to waste each other’s time with documents that have just been provided by Kemsa. We need time to familiarise ourselves with the details in the documents,” Mule said. Kemsa CEO Jonah Mwangi regretted the late submission and committed to meet deadlines in future. “We took a lot of time compiling the documents but this will not happen again,” Mwangi told the MPs. Mishra who is also the committee vice-chairperson directed that the agency appears before them next week with all documents required including their budgetary allocation for the current financial year.
