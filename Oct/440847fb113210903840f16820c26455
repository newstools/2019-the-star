Fast-rising boy group Ochungulo family says their planned collabo with rapper Khaligraph Jones wouldn't be a hit if released. Benzema, one of the group members, told Word is on Saturday that, "Ngoma Haikua noma." "We choose something that we feel like is hot. There is no need to give our fans a collabo with big artistes and yet it's not a hot track," he said. "We didn't feel that collabo, it wouldn't hit. Even if it was Chris Brown and it's not a hot track, we still wouldn't have released it." Talking about the issue, Khaligraph Jones told Word Is yesterday he is open to another track. "It was supposed to be released but we've not done that yet. They are doing so well alone, so I don't want to look like I'm getting into their wave," he said. "I wanted it to delay a little bit until the right time. I love their music so much. When the right time comes, we will release or even do another track. They know what they are doing. "I have songs that I recorded like two years ago and I'm releasing them now. You just need to study the industry." Ochungulo is currently working on a collabo with Sauti Sol.
