Brimin Kipkorir on Saturday won the 2019 Standard Chartered Marathon men’s 42.2 km race in a time of 2.10:43. The Iten-based athlete reclaimed the title he won in 2017 and walked home with Sh2 million in prize money. Kipkorir was followed home by Stephen Kipchirchir (2.11:53) and Victor Serem (2.12:00) during the 17th edition of the Nairobi Marathon. “I have been injured since April and I only resumed training in August. To come here and win is a testament to the hard work I have put in prior to the competition,” said the winner. Kipkorir took over control of the race after the 35 km mark and never looked back, romping home comfortably to be received at the finishing line by the Sports Cabinet secretary Amina Mohammed and PS Peter Kaberia. “I was very comfortable with my finishing and that is why I decided to charge after 30km, well aware my competitors could not put up with me,” he rejoiced. The women race was easily won by Purity Jebichi in a time of 2.30:34—nearly three minutes ahead of Chemtai Rionotukei (2.33:40) and Shelmita Muriuki (2.34:04). “I did not expect to win this race as I just resumed training a couple of months ago. I just wanted to test myself and now that I won. I want to fully venture into marathon,” Purity said.
