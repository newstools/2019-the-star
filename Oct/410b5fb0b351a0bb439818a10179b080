Cancer has the potential of causing other lifestyle diseases to the family members of the victim due to economic, social and psychological challenges they undergo when caring for their loved ones. This disease has left many families in abject poverty after selling almost every asset they own to meet the ever huge medical costs inside and outside the borders. While efforts to fight the scourge are in full force, families are still burdened. To reduce the burden of treatment among the families of victims, the government should consider declaring it a national disaster and subsequently offer free treatment and medicine to victims. This will relieve the caretakers of the financial burden and consequently protect them from ailments arising from depression.  Nairobi
