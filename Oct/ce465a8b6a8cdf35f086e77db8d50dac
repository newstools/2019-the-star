Kikuyu pop musician Samidoh has offered to sponsor two needy students from his former high school in Nyandarua county. Taking to social media, the star said he made an impromptu visit at Ol Joro Orok High School and met the two good performing students, who had issues with school fees. "I will be sponsoring their full education. I encourage others to help needy cases achieve their dreams," he wrote, adding that he suffered the same problems at the school and the lab technician would offer him lab paraffin for his night studies. Samidoh, real name Samuel Muchoki, rose to fame three years ago and since then, he has dominated Kikuyu music charts.
