Former Citizen TV news anchor Jacque Maribe has always kept the paternity of her son, Zahari close to her chest. Never once revealing who her baby daddy is. Today, she let the cat out of the bag. After attending the graduation ceremony of her son, Jacque took to Instagram to reveal who the father of her son is. "Family first. Happy graduation day Zahari. We, mum and dad @ericomondi are proud of you." She shared a photo of the happy family together. A source close to the couple told Word Is that they have been in good terms for the longest time. "At the moment, Jacque Maribe and Eric Omondi are in very good terms and they are co-parenting." Our source also clarified,Â "I don't think he would have posted that photo if they are not in good terms and if Jacque hasn't given him permission."
