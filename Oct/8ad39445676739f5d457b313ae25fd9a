As Obama called his wife 'babe,' Michelle in return wrote how they're still feeling the magic, decades later. Former US President Barack Obama and ex-first lady Michelle Obama, have taken their romance to Twitter after marking their 27 years in marriage. Barack, 58, and Michelle, 55, tied the knot on October 3, 1992. Posting romantic pictures of them on Thursday, the two sent love messages to each other on Instagram and Twitter to celebrate their milestone. Obama posted a scenic photo showing the two in a tight embrace. The two were photographed from behind, and are seen looking at the sunset while Michelle has her arms wrapped around her husband and her head resting on his shoulder. "Like the Beatles said: It’s getting better all the time. Thanks, babe, for 27 amazing years." Obama wrote. Less than an hour later, Michelle posted, too. In her photo, they are pictured grinning on a porch near what appears to be a lake, with another sunset in the background. "27 years ago, this guy promised me a life full of adventure. I’d say he’s delivered," Michelle wrote. She added "Here’s to our next chapter of becoming empty nesters and discovering what’s next—while still feeling the magic that brought us together all those years ago. Happy anniversary, Barack." The two are known to share romantic messages on special occasions.
