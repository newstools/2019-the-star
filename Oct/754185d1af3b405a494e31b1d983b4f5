Lukenya Assistant County Commissioner Elizabeth Karitu has been interdicted and arrested for allegedly losing the keys to a container in which the upcoming national examination papers are stored. Machakos County Commissioner Elizabeth Maina told journalists that  Karitu was arrested on Saturday night and detained at the Parklands Police Station in Nairobi. Maina said Karitu had informed them that she had gone to Avenue Hospital in Nairobi and when she returned she found her car had been broken into and her handbag, which contained the keys gone missing. “As a result, the officer has since been interdicted and plans to replace her are presently underway,” Maina said. She said following the incident security has been beefed up where the container is and efforts made with the Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC) to replace the padlock. Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha last month said security surveillance will be extended by several kilometres beyond school compounds during the upcoming national primary and secondary exams. He said they had mapped areas where exam malpractices are likely to occur for intensified security. Mogoha said these and other stringent measures in place will reduce cases of exam irregularities this year. Std 8 candidates will sit the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exams beginning October 28 and finish on October 31. Form 4 candidates will officially begin their Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exams on November 4 and the last paper will be done on November 27. Magoha spoke on Monday at Makutano Stadium during celebrations to mark 53rd International Literacy Day. “Last year we noted that exam malpractices were being conducted in staff quarters and outside school compounds, that's why we have intensified our security,” he said.
