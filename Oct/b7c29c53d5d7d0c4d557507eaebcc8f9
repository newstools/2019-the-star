Sauti Sol’s record label Sol Generation has partnered with KLM to showcase upcoming artistes as part of the airline’s 100th-anniversary celebrations. Nviiri the storyteller, Bensoul, Crystal Asige and Kaskazini have produced a six-track album called “1919 to Forever”. It addresses a wide variety of topics, ranging from love, escaping the rat race, communal celebrations and real-life issues the common Kenyan faces. KLM Eastern Africa commercial director Steven van Wijk said “a great song lives forever” in the African culture. “An album with arguably the best label for up and coming artistes makes the brand immortal, creating a positive association, reach and affinity with our brand. Through the tracks, we are serenading the audience,” he said. “Our collaboration with Sol Generation means we are continuously investing in the next generation of cultural influencers.” Sauti Sol introduced their new signees to fans this year after they released their hit song 'Extravaganza', which has garnered over three million views on YouTube. Bensoul and Nviiri have already released their singles under the label. However, Crystal and Kaskazini are yet to do so.
