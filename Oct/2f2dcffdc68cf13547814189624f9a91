An Embu KCPE candidate failed to complete her exam after developing what appeared to be a mental problem. Embu director of education James Kairu told the press the girl from Ugweri Primary School was moved out of the examination room to Embu Level 5 Teaching and Referral Hospital for medical treatment. Kairu said doctors ruled out the possibility of her completing the exam owing to the sudden health problem. She was whisked out of the exam room by teachers and invigilators after she began shouting and behaving wildly during the maths paper on Tuesday. Meanwhile, 23 centers in Mbeere North subcounty were supplied with exam papers by a chopper after Thuura river burst its banks. Vehicles used to ferry the exams were unable to reach the schools. Embu county police commander Daniel Rukunga told the Star on phone that owing to the flooding, choppers on standby were used to ferry the exams. The massive flood swept away a car transporting muguka from Gangara to Embu town but the driver escaped unhurt. Three candidates sat their exams from day one in hospital. One had given birth, another was bitten by a snake and the third fell ill. A candidate from Gatondo Primary School in Embu WestÂ  delivered a healthy bouncing baby at the Embu Level 5 Hospital on Monday night and arrangements were made by education officials for her to do the exam in hospital. Caroline Murugi from St Joseph Kivote Primary School sat her exam at Runyenjes Hospital where she was admitted over a sickness he did not disclose. Kenny Munene from Blessed Mary Academy did his exam at Kyieni Mission Hospital in Runyenjes where he was admitted after being bitten by a snake on Monday.
