More than 20 private schools in Vihiga risk closure due to poor infrastructure and unqualified teaching staff, Education director Hellen Nyang’au has said. Nyang’au said many private schools are temporary structures unfit for learning. “Most schools are set up in kiosk form with old roofing sheets that put the learners at risk. The ongoing inspection has also shown that most schools have untrained teachers,” she said. Those trained are yet to register with the Teachers Service Commission, the director said. She attributed poor service delivery to insufficient support and teaching staff. Most of the schools in dilapidated conditions were caught unawares by the county officials' visit. Fadhili and Neema primary schools face closure for being located at Luanda CBD. Schools that haven’t met all the requirements set out in the Basic Education Act 2013 will be shut down, Nyang'au said. "All unregistered teachers vanished from the school compound during the inspection," a source at Fadhili told journalists in confidence. Nyang’au urged parents with children in the affected schools to seek the assistance of their subcounty director for transfers. She urged parents to ensure they enrol their children in schools that are registered and recognised by the government. The inspection will go on until May next year. The affected schools include Noah’s Ark, Duke Academy, Gisambai Junior School and Truth Foundation (Hamisi constituency); Little Angels Academy, Vineyard Academy (Sabatia constituency). In Mudete constituency, the schools that risk closure are Kipepeo Community, Fadhili Star Academy, Glorious Academy and Lakewood Academy. Others are Joy Academy and Sunrise Academy (Emuhaya); and Downhome Elite Academy. Florida Academy, Nalea Education Centre, Rehema Academy, Bright Star Academy Bulka Academy (Vihiga).
