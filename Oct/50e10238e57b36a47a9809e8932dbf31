A family in Mwakuhenga, Kilifi North, has yet to come to terms with the loss of their two sons who drowned on Friday afternoon. The pupils of Mwakuhenga Primary School drowned while swimming with friends in a temporary dam. Lucky Chimera, 10, was in Grade 1 and his bother Leonard Masoud, eight, was in pre-primary. They were sons of Ndegwa Mwadudu and Rehema Kazungu. Family spokesperson Gerald Mangale said the two were returning home from school in the company of other pupils when they opted to swim first. “One of the pupils came and told us Lucky and Leonard had drowned. We rushed and found well-wishers who had removed one of them who died while being given first aid. The other body took some time to be found,” he said. The dam started as a gulley along a waterway as a result of the ongoing heavy rains. It expanded and got deeper and large in volume. "The dam is in someone’s farm and it is a waterway that has created several depressions, which are now storing water. It is now a threat to lives, especially to children. It is in an open place and it is slippery on the sides,” Mangale said. The bodies were taken to Kilifi County Hospital mortuary. Neighbour Farida Kiti said the father was overwhelmed and could not believe th3 goings-on. “The mother of the boys was not around when the news of their death reached us. The father nearly threw himself in the dam and kept on asking why his boys died,” she said. The dam is a few kilometres from the boy's home. Kiti said they first went to another first dam but were chased away before opting for the tragedy site. "They decided to go to the next dam. It is in a low area. There is a woman who spotted them but before she could go down the slope to chase them, they were already drowning,” she said. She said the woman also slipped and nearly drowned.
