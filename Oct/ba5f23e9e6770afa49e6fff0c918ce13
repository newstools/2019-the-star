Kuppet said on Thursday they will not accept a proposal by Education CS George Magoha that outsiders manage money sent to secondary schools. Union secretary general Okello Misori and chairman Omboko Milemba said principals have the capacity to manage the cash. Misori and Milemba said Magoha should stop undermining the principals who have been trained in financial management. The unionists spoke at Kisii Sports Club during Kuppet Kisii branch annual general meeting. “We want to tell our Education CS that we will not accept his proposal that outsiders manage school funds,” Misori said. “I’m wondering how foreigners can manage the funds that the principals have diligently been managing over the years.” Misori said the union will continue to negotiate with the Teachers Service Commission on promotions, house allowances and the employment of more teachers. Milemba said the union is determined to fight for the welfare of the teachers. “We will be fighting to see if teachers who have stagnated in job groups L and M get promoted,” the unionist added.
