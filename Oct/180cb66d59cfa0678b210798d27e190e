  The High Court has declined to stop the prosecution of Embakasi North MP James Mwangi Gakuya and 10 others who are facing graft charges relating to a Sh40 million CDF project. In a ruling delivered by Justice John Onyiengo on behalf of Justice Mumbi Ngugi on Wednesday, the court dismissed an application to stay lower court proceedings saying it has no merit and reason to interfere with the decision of the trial court. “I therefore decline to exercise powers of revision in respect to a ruling by a trial magistrate court. Therefore, I find no basis for interfering with the decision of the trial court as no error of law or fact has been established,” Onyiengo said. The eleven accused persons had moved to the High Court seeking to review the trial court’s decision that directed the case to proceed. Their lawyers disqualified themselves for being forced to proceed with the case without some evidence documents. The accused had also sought to review trial magistrate’s decision that dismissed their application to be supplied with investigation diary, investigation report and copy of occurrence report book by the prosecution. The MP and his co-accused said they were being forced to proceed with the case without representation by advocates. Gakuya and the CDF officials are facing charges of fraudulent acquisition of public property, conflict of interest, conspiracy to defraud and willful failure to adhere to procurement and disposal laws. Gakuya is charged alongside Cleophas Omariba Oyaro (district accountant), Ms Leah Waithera Guchu (fund account manager) and Constituency Development Fund (CDF) chairman Richard Mwangi Chuchu. Prosecution says investigations by EACC established irregular award of contracts, where the companies associated with Gakuya were awarded tenders worth Sh40 million and paid through bank accounts to which the MP was a signatory.  edited by peter obuya
