Royal Media Service Strategy and Innovations director Linus Kaikai has described Hussein Mohamed as a fantastic employee. The celebrated journalist recently announced he will be exiting the media house. Speaking to Word Is on Friday, Linus said, “I would say his performance is evident and the public can judge that he was a dedicated journalist. He has been a fantastic person to work with, and a good interviewer as well.” Linus said Hussein has a great future in media, a hint that he would still be in media. Hussein announced on Twitter that he had decided to take a break. The prime time newscaster appeared on the screen every Tuesday night and conducted high-profile interviews. “It has been a wonderful 10 years at Citizen TV. I have enjoyed & relished every moment I shared with my colleagues at RMS. I have decided to take a break after October In Sha Allah to concentrate on other matters. Loved the fans, the critics & everything in between. See you soon,” he tweeted. Linus said it will not be wise to announce who will be taking over from Hussein. “He has given a notice of one month,” he said. Linus encouraged other journalists to emulate Hussein. “Just know that it’s about working hard and knowing your strength. For Hussein, he was dedicated to doing interviews and that is what made him a name,” he said. “Journalism is about passion and it does not matter what level you are in. Whether young or already established, you must bring passion to work and that is what Hussein brought in.” Fans and other journalists also wished Hussein well.
