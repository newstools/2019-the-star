Lecturers and university staff are set to get a new pay deal on Wednesday as the dons' union and university bosses meet to finalise a proposed Sh7 billion deal. In the deal, academic staff get a 5.4 per cent increment on their basic salary and an extra Sh1.8 billion to cover their pension. Negotiations between the University Academic Staff Union officials and university bosses, through the Inter-Public Universities Councils Consultative Forum (IPUCCF), follows a revised offer presented to the union a fortnight ago. However, negotiations failed to take place on Tuesday for lack of quorum from the university managers. Uasu secretary general Constantine Wasonga said that the meeting will further be used to raise other non-monetary issues to push for better working space for their members. Sources from the union say that Uasu will take the 5.4 per cent increment on the basic salary offered to its members. The proposal is part of the ongoing negotiations that will inform the next working deal for academic staff between 2017 and 2022. However, union leaders are keen to know when their members will be paid the money accrued from the delay to reach a deal. The new CBA covers the period between 2017 and 2021. This means it is two years behind schedule hence should be backdated cover for the period lost. On Tuesday, Wasonga said the union sought clarification on some issues before making the decision. "We have some concerns to iron out with the IPUCCF before we can make a deal or reject it. Some are non-monetary issues," Wasonga said. Edited by R.Wamochie
