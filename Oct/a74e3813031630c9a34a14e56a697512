Residents are set to benefit from a plan by the Murang’a Water and Sanitation Company to increase connections to more than 3,000 homesteads. If the firm's proposal for funding to an international partner is approved, families within Kiangage in the outskirts of Murang’a town will get clean water for domestic use. Muwasco MD Daniel Ng’ang’a said the project will require about Sh100 million to put up an intake and treatment plant at Karichiugu river and for piping to Kiangage area. Ng’ang’a said that the company had presented its proposal to the Water for Life Programme, a Dutch organisation. As per the proposal, the project will also increase water supply in parts of Murang’a town, which is the county headquarters. The MD expressed confidence that the firm will get the much-needed funds to implement the project within six months. He spoke on Friday as he welcomed cyclists from Water For Life programme who are doing 1,100 kilometres charity cycling to mobilise funds for water projects. “Once completed the project will be able to produce 4,000 litres of clean water on a daily basis,” Ng’ang’a said. The Dutch organisation has in the past partnered with several water companies in the country to implement various projects. For instance, in 2016 Muwasco benefited from Sh17.2 million from the organization which helped connect more than 9,000 families in Kabuta and Sagana road areas with clean domestic water. Ng’ang’a presented a Sh100,000 cheque to the cyclists led by Water For Life Programme Manager Like Nijik.
