Policemen and women work hard to protect us from any criminal danger but safety cannot be guaranteed. Society relies on the skills and dedication of police officers for protection forgetting that they also need care and safety as their job comes with many risks which may result in serious injuries. The officers might be forced to contend with heavily armed criminals to ensure the safety of the public. Itâ€™s time someone stood up for them as they are the most endangered job group in a country whose crime rates are rising by the day. They also have families and the treatment they are accorded by the public because of their title is uncalled for. Most cases of missing cops result from their good work which did not sit well with some people implicated in a crime.  Mombasa
