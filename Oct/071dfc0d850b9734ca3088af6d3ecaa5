Butali Warrior's midfield maestro Frank Wanagwe has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a recurring knee injury. Wanangwe has been having the problem for the past two seasons and the latest setback is a major blow to the defending champions who look primed to retain the title. Wanangwe missed four matches in the first leg with the same problem and will play no part in the forthcoming matches. Butali face Sailors on October 27. Western Jaguars, Wazalendo and Parklands await Butalii next month as they seek to end the season on a high with the Greensharks match on December 1. Wanangwe has scored three goals so far and is optimistic of a speedy recovery after being advised to take a rest. He said the injury may be as a result of the tear and wear. "I hope to recover in time. This problem has been nagging for the last two seasons, forcing me to miss a number of key matches in the first round. My brother had the same problem and underwent surgery," he added. He said he was advised at Kijabe hospital to have a one month rest. "I think it's wear and tear. Let's wait and see," he noted. Despite coach Dennis Owoka saying the team has enough depth of quality and talented players to choose from, captain Kenneth Nyongesa admitted Wanangwe's loss is a big blow and very untimely. He said: "Losing Wanangwe is a blow to us because he is a quality player and comes at a time we are fighting to retain the title.  He's been very key to Butali and it's a pity to miss his services in the remaining matches. We wish him well as a team and other players step up the fight." Wanangwe has won two Premier League titles in the past five seasons. He faces a race against time to be fit for the African Club Championship scheduled for December 1-10 which the club is keen to take part after previously giving it a wide berth.
