A 26-year-old woman died on Tuesday morning from electrocution in Oyugis town, Kasipul constituency. Cynthia Akoth had been undertaking laundry and had gone to hang clothes on a line attached to an iron sheet on the roof of a house with electricity. "Neighbours said her wet hands came into contact with a nail attached to the wall. She sustained injuries which made her unconscious,” Oyugis town chief Nelson Odiwuor said. The woman was from Kokal sublocation but resided in Oyugis town. She was rushed to Matata Hospital in Oyugis but was pronounced dead on arrival and transferred to the facility's mortuary. Residents blamed the tragedy on illegal power connections in the town. Led by Samuel Owida, they appealed to Kenya Power to crack down on illegal connections. "There are illegal and substandard electricity connections in many buildings in Oyugis town. We urge the KPLC to carry out a crackdown to stop the vice, which poses a serious danger to residents’ lives," Owida said. He urged his power consumers to seek services from certified electricians during an electric fault. (Edited by F'Orieny)
