 The Busia county government has no plan of evacuating residents in lowland areas prone to floods amid heavy rains that have caused rivers to swell. Heavy downpours in Mt Elgon and the larger western will likely cause flooding in parts of Busia including Budalang'i. Residents of Kamolo, Machakusi and Amoni villages have already been flooded after River Malakisi burst its banks early this week. The villages are at the confluence where the river joins River Malaba that drains into Lake Victoria. The lowland area often floods following heavy rains in Mt Elgon, the source of River Malaba. Lat week, flash floods wreaked havoc in Machakusi after the bridge linking the towns of Busia and Malaba was submerged. Transport was disrupted. Busia county disaster management chief officer Ezekiel Okwach on Thursday said lack of funds and an alternative location to relocate those in the affected areas means there will be no evacuation. “Yes, we would wish to evacuate the people in the three villages but as you know, the exercise is expensive and we don’t have money,” Okwach told the Star on the phone. He said the county has no land to relocate those affected. Okwach said the county government will instead construct channels to ease rainwater flow and ensure floods do not destabilise residents. He said the department was working closely with the Ministry of Devolution to ensure necessary mitigation measures are put in place to prevent loss of lives and property in case of floods. The ongoing heavy rains, the meteorological department warned on October 14, will persist until December and there are already worries that some parts of the country will be hit by heavy flooding.  edited by peter obuya
