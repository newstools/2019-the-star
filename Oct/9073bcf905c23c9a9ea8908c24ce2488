According to the draws released by FIBA Africa, KPA yesterday had an early rest day as the Pool ‘F’ event threw off with two matches on the card. The top two teams will qualify for the next round of the inaugural tournament. The preliminary round has 48 teams grouped in six pools. Coach Sammy Kiki said they have had three sessions since they arrived and that the players' morale is high. “I am happy with the draw. I will be able to see our opponents and plan our game accordingly. It is hot here,” he noted. “It is going to be a tough game since they are playing at home. It is an international game, so I will treat it with the respect it deserves.” Kiki continued, “I have experienced players who have played in such tournaments and they will be able to guide us.” The porters play Beau Vallon Heat from Seychelles tomorrow, tackle Cobra Sport of South Sudan the following day before winding against Usoni of Comoros on Sunday.
