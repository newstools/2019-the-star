Laikipia traders have given the county administration one week to reinstate the sacked doctors or face demonstrations in major towns. The traders said in Nanyuki yesterday that they cannot be paying taxes yet be denied medical services. Governor Ndiritu Muriithi sacked 62 doctors three months ago. “We demand the resignation or impeachment of CEC for Health Lenai Kamario for incompetence in handling his docket,” they said in a statement read by Maina Thumbi. They also raised concerns about the county's draft Finance Bill 2019-20  saying it is discriminatory on revenue collection by regions. “Laikipia East businesses will pay more than Laikipia West and North. New taxes on income and transaction taxes are clearly double taxation,” they said. The traders also protested against alleged outsourcing of the infrastructure equipment worth over Sh180 million by the county government to a multinational company in Nairobi. They said that they will reject attempts to deny local contractors business in favour of national and multinational companies who do not pay taxes and levies locally. “We shall, therefore, move to seek an opinion from the county assembly and senate on this suspect single-sourcing transaction,”  Thumbi said.
