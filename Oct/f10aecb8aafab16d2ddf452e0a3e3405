 Turkana University College principal Thomas Akuja has termed as witch-hunt claims that he bought a vehicle worth Sh7.5 million with following procurement procedures. The university council has queried the principal's decision to buy a Toyota Fortuner KCT 163Y for Sh7.5, saying it was kept in the dark. Minutes of a council meeting of September 25, seen by the Star, shows the council asking for a breakdown of information regarding the purchase of the vehicle. The council told the Star Akuja did not involve them and that the price of the vehicle was over-quoted. The member faulted Akuja for buying the vehicle at a time the institution was short on development funds. Akuja said the claims were not true and asked the media to disregard the council. “It’s a witch hunt,” Akuja told the Star in a text message. “The normal procurement procedures were followed. We are in good terms with the council but there are some individuals who want to mess things and taint the image of Turkana University College. The records are with Toyota Company and I can confirm all procurement procedures were followed,” Akuja said on the phone. Ikamar Ejore, Toyota Kenya manager for Lodwar confirmed the vehicle was bought at Sh7.5 million by Turkana University College and that they were only waiting for its collection.  edited by peter obuya
