Kenyan champions Gor Mahia have been handed a Sh2 million boost ahead of Sunday’s CAF Confederations Cup playoff return match away to DR Congo’s DC Motema Pembe by Agro-Chemical. Going forward, Gor stands to benefit from the sale of the company’s product, Patriot, for the next three years, where they will get Sh5 for every bottle sold. “We are pleased to partner with Gor for the next three years. We had our own team for long but we always wanted a partnership which will bring a win-win situation,” said the company’s chief executive officer, Ashok Agrawal. While unveiling the sponsor, Gor chairman Ambrose Rachier urged all the clubs 180 branches to promote the brand and rallied the ‘Green Army’ to consume the product. The long serving club chairman, at the same time, took a swipe with the government for their slow pace in implementing the process of channeling money from the Sports Fund to the clubs. “The government has performed dismally in promoting football. The corporate world has done well in the past but since the exit of SportPesa, we have suffered. Our wage bill stands at Sh5.5 million per month,” said Rachier. “We have instructed our branches to promote the new product so that we may have money trickle into our accounts.” Gor will be seeking to fork out a win or a high scoring draw in the match as the first leg played last week at the Moi Stadium Kasarani ended in a one all draw to the advantage of Motema.
