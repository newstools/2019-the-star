Incumbent Football Kenya Federation (FKF) officials from Uasin Gishu County are appealing to stakeholders to consider them for another term. The officials who were speaking during a public debate held last week presented and defended their scorecard and urged the electorates to retain them in the forthcoming elections. Led by their chairman Paul Tororei, treasurer David Simiyu and Youth Representative Moses Kibet, the officials argued that their record was there for all to see. Tororei said for the last four years, they established junior football of under 13 and 15 as well as women football in the sub-branch that has now been elevated the branch in the coming elections. “My record speaks for itself. I had to establish a successful league for under 13 and under 15 as well as the women's team in Division Two among others,” said Tororei. The incumbent will face off with his vice Peter Chesang who failed to turn up for the debate citing anomalies in the organisation.  In the absence of Chesang,  Tororei assured the audience that they have 15 teams in Division two and are hoping to increase the number next season. “We are among the few counties that run women football and league. We have Eldoret Falcons in Women Premier League and Raiply, who play in Division One,” said Tororei. Event organizer Fredrick Owino on his side said the debate was to give all aspirants equal opportunity to sell their manifesto to the clubs who will vote.
