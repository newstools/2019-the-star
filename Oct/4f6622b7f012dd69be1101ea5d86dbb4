National Super League side Shabana FC suffered a huge blow following the resignation of their head coach Gilbert Selebwa yesterday. Selebwa announced his resignation yesterday morning, claiming that the cash- strapped club owes him four months’ salary arrears. “It has become untenable for me to continue working under these kinds of conditions. Debts are piling up and the club management is not sorting my problem. Every time I ask for my money, I’m told to wait,” he said. “I have decided to call it quits. God will open a way for me and I wish Shabana players and fans well in the current NSL campaign. I’m leaving a youthful and exciting team and if well handle I know they will do well,” said the former AFC Leopards coach. He said the expectations of fans were high and sometimes unrealistic. “The fans have set the bar too high. They expect us to win all games yet we didn’t even have a pre-season. When we draw, it’s a problem and if we lose, it’s a bigger problem,” he noted. Selebwa assembled the current playing unit two weeks to the league kick-off and used the Kecoszo games as a pre-season. Club secretary-general Peter Omwando said he had not received Selebwa’s resignation. He, however, said assistant coach Vincent Nyaberi will take charge of the team in tomorrow’s game against Vihiga United at Gusii Stadium. “Nyaberi will take over on interim basis as I sort out Selebwa's issues,” said Omwando. He, however, disputed Selebwa’s claims that he is owed four months’ salary arrears. “The chairman has been paying him in instalments. It is true we have financial challenges because we don’t have a sponsor. This is not a unique problem to Shabana. Even clubs in the Kenya Premier League are facing the same problems. However the club management and some well-wishers have been contributing funds to ensure the club honours all their matches,” he added.
