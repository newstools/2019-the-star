The Employment and Labour Relations Court has slammed brakes on the recruitment of the Kenya Water Towers Agency CEO. Justice S Radido issued the injunction on Monday after activist Okiya Omtatah moved to court, challenging a decision by Kenya Water Towers board to re-advertise the position. KWTA advertised on April 1 the vacancy of the position of CEO. On April 30, the agency published another advert and 52 candidates applied. Of those, 12 were shortlisted and interviewed before three names finally got to the tail end of the process. But instead of a winner being announced, the board re-advertised the position again on September 10. Omtatah in his pleading challenged the validity of the decision by the board for failing to recommend a successful candidate. He told the court no valid reasons were given by the board nor were results of the interviews published. "It is hereby ordered that a temporary order of injunction be and is hereby issued prohibiting respondents and their agents and any person howsoever acting from giving effect to the advertisement subtitled Advert/KWTA/CEO, declaring of vacancy for the position of Chief Executive Officer-1 position ," the judge ruled. Candidates were, among other qualifications, required to satisfy the requirements of Chapter Six of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 on leadership and integrity. They were to present a certificate of good conduct from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, a clearance certificate from the Higher Education Loans Board, clearance from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, a valid tax compliance certificate from the Kenya Revenue Authority and a report from an approved credit reference bureau. The interparties hearing is set for October 14.
