Point Blank TV show host Tony Gachoka has been released on Sh50,000 bail following his arrest at the Diani Airstrip on Wednesday. He was arraigned at a Kwale magistrate court on Thursday and charged with creating a nuisance at the premises occupied by Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) and being found in a state of intoxication. The police record states that on Wednesday, at 11am, Gachoka refused to be screened at the airstrip entrance point and tried to force his entry aboard a Silverstone plane while carrying alcoholic drinks at Diani Airstrip in Ukunda. Appearing before the principal Magistrate Joe Omido, Gachoka pleaded not guilty to both charges. Through his lawyer, Raphael Chimera, Gachoka filed an application for bail and bond. Chimera said that his client is an international public figure and has a reputation to protect. The lawyer said Gachoka hosts a TV show watched by more than 4.5 million viewers and pleaded with the court to grant him permission to continue with his work. He was released and the matter will be mentioned on October 25.
