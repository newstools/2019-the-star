Quins coach Dominique Habimana has urged his young side to improve their discipline ahead of a mouth-watering showdown against champions KCB on Saturday. Habimana saw his charges lose 26-13 to Homeboyz last weekend in their opening match of the season and insisted they must reduce the penalties given away. “I believe we gave away too many penalties because we both scored two tries each but the kickable penalties were the difference. This how Homeboyz were able to win the match,” he added. Habimana believes his young charges skippered by Kevin Angote will get better in the upcoming fixtures. “The effort of hunger and drive is there. Most of our players were playing their first Kenya Cup so they will get used to the intensity of the league in the weeks and months to come," added Habimana. Habimana was encouraged by the performance of the forwards in the set-piece and said it will hold them in good stead in the match against the bankers. “ They are a formidable team and their set-piece is one of their strength. We must match them in that regard,” quipped Habimana. The tactician said there are certain aspects they intend to capitalise on against the bankers. “There are areas where we think we can target them and work to our advantage. Rugby is a game of inches and we want to be in the ascendancy come Saturday,” noted Habimana. Quins lost thrice to the bankers last season, losing 22-13 and 24-10 in the group stage and 46-13 in the semifinals. Habimana believes a favourable run of fixtures between now and the Christmas break will be good to asses where they stand in the pecking order. The Ngong Road outfit have matches coming up against Western Bulls, Blak Blad, Nakuru, Menengai Oilers and Mwamba before the festive season and Habimana was optimistic of good results.
