Security officers in Bomet are holding a headteacher found drunk on Tuesday during administration of the KCPE examat his school. Bomet county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding said David Ngerechi of Sonokwek Primary School at Ndarawetta in Bomet Central was arrested by Administration Police manning the centre. The headteacher has been relieved of his duties and his deputy has taken over in an acting capacity to oversee the exams ending Thursday, Omonding said. “To ensure the examination goes on well at that school, we have had to replace him…His deputy will now take charge because we do not want any hitch," Omonding told the press in his office. He said the headteacher remains suspended from supervising the exam. “We shall also have him transferred to another school," he said. Ngederechi was to appear in court on Tuesday to face charges of being drunk while on duty and of dereliction of duty. Omonding said all teachers had been warned against drinking and other misbehaviour while on duty. He said the teacher would be punished according to regulations to serve as a lesson to others. The county official said there was a great reduction in the number of pregnant candidates, from 19 last year to two this year. Only two candidates were sitting their exams at Longisa Hospital. “One of them comes from a school in the neighbouring Narok while the other one comes from a private school in Chepalungu,”  Omonding said. He said the reduction in pregnancies is the result of all stakeholders cooperating in education and sensitisation programmes. (Edited by V. Graham)
