Ex-WCB employee and singer QBoy Msafi has turned into a barber at a saloon in Kariakoo, Dar Es Salaam. Speaking to Tanzanian media pundits, he rubbished claims he is now a broke man. "When you work with over 50 people, you tend to adapt, but when you leave the organisation, there will be a lot of change because people were giving you support and connection and now they are not," he said. "I am now a barber and being a barber is my life. And unlike reports, this saloon is not Zari's. I didn't go to South Africa to beg her for work, I went to finish my studies and get my certificates." Msafi says even with the regrets he has for leaving the Diamond Platnumz-owned record label, they still have a special place in his heart. "I still have the memories from that place," he said. He hit headlines early this year after a clip went viral showing him crying to Diamond to take him back. "When you surrender to someone, it doesn't mean you force them to do what you want. I just asked for forgiveness from the people I worked with. I am human, and I am sinful," he said in a past interview. "I realised there are things that I did wrong. Me and WCB don't have any problem but I did wrong and I wanted to go back. Even today that was my intention, that they forgive and take me back." Talking about the comparison going on between Harmonize and Diamond, QBoy said Diamond cannot be surpassed. "I can never refuse Jesus and go with Peter. Diamond is a very big artiste. So photocopy can never be original. The point is, Diamond will still have his crown. Diamond is not supposed to be compared with any nonsense," he said. He made headlines with the song 'Mugacherere', featuring Rayvanny and Shetta, one that now has over 2 million views on YouTube.
