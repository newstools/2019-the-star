Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha is on Tuesday expected to supervise the opening of the containers of KCPE examination papers for the Coast. He will be in Mvita. The three-day Kenya Certificate of Primary Education test starts on Tuesday. On Monday, candidates did rehearsals for the national exam. Mombasa Education director Moses Makori confirmed that Magoha will be in Mombasa to supervise the opening and tour several schools. Last year, the CS visited the Coast on the first day of the KCPE exam. He was then the chairman of the Kenya National Examination Council. Makori said Mombasa has 19,198 candidates who will be sitting for the examinations in 377 centres. One centre, Green Field Academy in Changamwe, which had 34 candidates, was shut down last month by Magoha after it was found to be unsafe. They have been transferred to Umoja Primary School. Last year, 18,503 candidates sat for the KCPE exam in 388 centres in Mombasa. The number of candidates has increased by 695, representing about 3.7 per cent. This year, public schools have the highest number of registered candidates,10,057. Private schools, which have been producing top candidates in the national exams, have 9,141 candidates.
