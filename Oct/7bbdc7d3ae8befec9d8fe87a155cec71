President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday nominated Reverend Samuel Kobia as National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) Chairperson. Uhuru further nominated Samuel Kona, former Rangwe MP Phillip Okundi, Peris Nyutu, former Madera East MP Abdulaziz Ali Farah, former Nairobi Finance CEC Danvas Makori, Fatuma Tabwara, former Vihiga Woman Rep Dorcas Kedogo as members. Their names will now be forwarded to the National Assembly for vetting. If they are cleared, the team will pick over from former Speaker Francis Ole Kaparo who has been at the helm of the commission since 2014. Kaparo's term ended last year, but President Uhuru Kenyatta in a gazette notice extended their term by one year. Born in March 1947, Kobia is a Methodist clergyman and the first African to be elected as the secretary-general of the World Council of Churches serving between 2004 and 2009. Kobia also served as a commissioner of the Judicial Service Commission between 2013 and 2015 before his abrupt resignation. in January, the High Court declared the recruitment of commissioners to the National Cohesion and Integration Commission by Parliament as unconstitutional. The court ruled that any appointment resulting from the nominations by Parliament was null and void. Justice Wilfrida Okwany ruled that the National Assembly has no powers to nominate people to the commission, saying that the MPs' mandate must be within the constitution. The National Assembly's committee on cohesion and equal opportunities had commenced the recruitment of seven commissioners. It had scheduled interviews for 54 candidates shortlisted on November 12 to 14 last year.
