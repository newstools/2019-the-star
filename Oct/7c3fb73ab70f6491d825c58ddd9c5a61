Migori Senator Ochillo Ayacko has dismissed claims of laxity in his oversight of Governor Okoth Obado's administration. Ayacko said though he has toned down his public criticism of the Migori administration, his oversight role is still strong. Commentators believe Ayacko's silence is a tactical move to seek the governor's support in Migori succession politics. “The electorate is keen to see the governor deliver on his mandate and that can only be achieved through proper oversight. That is what I’m doing currently,” he said. The senator spoke to journalists on Tuesday in Migori town. Ayacko said that service delivery would be greatly hampered if leaders are not united hence Obado should be given time to deliver on his mandate. In the 2017 General Elections, Ayacko vied and failed against Obado in both ODM primaries and the main poll. Ayacko appealed Obado's win in court but abandoned the case to vie as a senator in a by-election after the death of journalist Ben Oluoch Okello. Already, aspirants for Migori governor in 2022 are courting the support of Obado led by his county secretary Christopher Rusana. Other hopefuls are former Migori MP John Pesa, former Rongo MP Dalmas Otieno and former Nyatike MP Edick Anyanga among others. In a bid to pacify Obado’s support base, Ayacko has been calling on MCAs to enact legislation to help in their oversight role. “Our MCA’s should not give room for the executive to plunder resources that ought to serve citizens. They should enact legislation that will bring crucial services to the electorate,” Mr Ayacko said. He hailed the recent move by the county assembly members to demonstrate over delay in issuance of bursaries. “In the recent past, MCA’s could not oversight the county government for fear of reprisals from the top organ but it seems the trend is fast changing,” he said.
