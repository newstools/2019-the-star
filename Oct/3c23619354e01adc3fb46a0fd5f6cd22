Kenyan businessman Manu Chandaria has pledged Sh10 million to replace leaking roofs in schools of world record holder Eliud Kipchoge's choice. This is after he smashed the under two hour target in the Ineos challenge in Vienna on Saturday. Kipchoge ran 42km in 1:59:40. Chandaria, in a statement on Saturday, said, “Congratulations on Kipchoge's win. Wow. To celebrate that, Manu Chandaria Foundation will provide Sh10 million of roofing to replace leaking roofs of the schools of his choice." Kipchoge made history by being the first human to run a marathon in under two hours. Kipchoge ran 4.4 laps of a 9.6 kilometre course, consisting of a long straight with a loop at each end. Kipchoge will also receive a brand new Isuzu pickup from Isuzu East Africa. Sports CS Amina Mohamed, in her congratulatory message, said the government would consider an appropriate reward for his inspiration to other athletes to break existing standards. “On behalf of the government, the Ministry congratulates and highly commends Eliud Kipchoge for this outstanding performance. We assure Kenyans that an appropriate consideration or reward will be extended to Kipchoge for inspiring other athletes to break existing standards,” Mohamed said. Kipchoge said he wants to make sports an interesting game where people wake up and run. When he started the race, Kipchoge was greeted with a misty autumnal morning and a smattering of fans for his bid to run an unofficial sub-two hour marathon. The marathon world record holder's highly controlled attempt to break the two-hour barrier started at 8.15am local time (6.15 GMT). Kipchoge's feat will, however, not count as a world record.
