A village elder who played a key role in giving directions to census enumerators was on Wednesday charged with defilement. Patrick Macharia, 29, denied the charges before Kibera senior resident magistrate Boaz Ombewa. Macharia is accused that on September 29 at Gachui in Dagoreti subcounty, Nairobi county, he picked a minor who was in the company of other children playing football to his nearby house and defiled her. “My friend had gone to pick a ball that had been kicked far from me when he came and hold my hand, took me to his house, undressed me and defiled me,” the 11-year-old reported to her mother as court documents show. Macharia is alleged to have mingled with the minor severally during the census period. On most occasions, he would greet her as he directed the census enumerators from house to house. The accused person is alleged to have used a heavy blanket to cover the mouth of the minor after overpowering her. He was arrested moments after allowing her back to her parents without realising she was bleeding profusely from her private parts. He told her not to reveal the incidence to anyone. “The bedsheet had been bloodstained and she narrated to me the whole encounter,” she reported to her mother. Her mother reported the matter at Gachui police post. On Wednesday, the prosecution requested the court to order the suspect to be detained at the station for DNA sampling. He was released on Sh300,000 and bail of a similar amount. Ombewa directed that the accused be detained for DNA taking pending mention on October 23. The case will be heard on December 10.
