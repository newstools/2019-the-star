When a student is enrolled in a university he/she gives the undertaking to abide by the rules and regulations of the university, including those relating to conduct and discipline. The students are bound by what the university considers acceptable conduct. There are penalties for breaches of policies and misconduct. This is as it should be in any orderly society. No dignified university tolerates behaviour that causes distress and fear to its internal and outside publics either through harassment or bullying. The law calls for emotional and intellectual tolerance for those we do not agree with. There shouldn't be any room for base animal instincts. Yet this is what happened at Kenyatta University on Monday and Tuesday forcing the indefinite closure of the institution. A section of the student community was unhappy with the administrationâ€™s alleged refusal to extend the fee payment deadline, suspension of student leaders, the alleged sacking of casual workers and the increase of graduation fee from Sh3,500 to Sh6,000. Those students chose to resort to juvenile behaviour and rioted, engaging the police in running battles within the institution and along the busy Thika Superhighway. Granted, there is a lot of tolerance in our universities. But breaching security regulations like pulling down walls is unacceptable and deserves condemnation.
