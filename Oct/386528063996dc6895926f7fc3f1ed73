National cricket team skipper Shem Obado has attributed the team’s elimination from the ICC Twenty20 World Qualifier to their poor batting form. Kenya were bowled out for 73 in pursuit for 118 by Papua New Guinea— missing out on a playoff spot that would have seen them get a chance to qualify for next year’s Twenty20 World Cup in Australia. Prior to the loss against PNG, Obado’s charges had also been bowled out for 94 by Namibia. “It is a disappointing performance and I think we all played badly, particularly batsmen. The batsmen didn’t take up the responsibility in the two matches that we needed to win and get the next level. Our inability to get runs on the board made all the difference and we are all guilty about it. Batting is an area that we certainly need to improve on,” Obado said. The Kongonis player also cited mental strength as their other undoing. “In the two matches against Namibia and PNG, we didn’t have a good start and that’s why we lost. You saw the difference in the opening matches against Scotland and Netherlands. We put on a good show— getting to 130 plus and I thought we were up there only for things to fall apart. This is a matter of great concern and we need to address it as soon as possible,” Obado added. The team’s composition during the qualifiers also raised a lot of questions with Emmanuel Bundi being denied playing time until the last match against PNG, where he almost single-handedly gave Kenya the win after picking 4 for 14. Rakep Patel was also rested against PNG for underperforming Rushab Patel—a decision that backfired when the latter was dismissed for a duck. Aman Gandhi, who had impressed with the bat in the win against Singapore as an opener after being rested in the first two matches, was dropped to number five.
