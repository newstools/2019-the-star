Land buying firms in Ruiru and Juja subcounties have been directed by the Ministry of Lands to surrender their documents to fast-track issuance of title deeds. The ministry wants the companies to submit their members’ registers, mother title, maps and other related documents within a week. Ruiru deputy county commissioner Geoffrey Ithai said that an ongoing land clinic had found that most property firms delayed members' title deeds for decades, hence the move. Ithai spoke during a meeting with directors of property firms in Ruiru town. The commissioner said that some of the firms have been siphoning cash from their members and other unsuspecting landowners. “Multiple allocations of land parcels resulting in prolonged and heated disputes is also rampant within this region,” Ithai said. He said other firms have been demanding a lot of cash in fees from their members for clearance for title deeds. Ithai said that leadership wrangles by the management of the firms have also hindered the issuance of title deeds to members. “We want a situation whereby all these firms will be wound up after all members have been issued with their title deeds so that the tussles over who leads the company and the court cases can come to an end,” the commissioner said. Ruiru MP Simon Ng'ang'a King'ara said the subcounty has 513 land buying companies. He told the company heads who are embroiled in leadership tussles to solve their disputes amicably and out of court so as to fast-track issuance of titles to members. “These firms will not exist forever because once they have subdivided their land among their members and issued them with title deeds, they will no longer have any other business on the land,” King’ara said.
