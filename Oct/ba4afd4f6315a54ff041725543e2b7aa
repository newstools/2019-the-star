The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has warned Kenyans over the purchase of electronics from dealers without a fixed physical address. The DCI has said the purchase of electronics which include mobile phones, laptops, TV sets should be accompanied by a receipt which clearly itemises the particulars of the bought gadget. DCI termed it 'risky and dangerous' to buy any electronic device from suspicious outlets, the majority which may be stolen items by gangsters. "Most are those who buy stolen items from armed gangsters who have violently robbed innocent citizens and in the process kill or maim them," DCI tweeted. "When police forensically investigate and find you in possession of such said devices, by the time it is established that you were not involved in the crime, you may have suffered immensely." The DCI further said that the buyer found in possession of the stolen items might suffer immediate consequences of the actual criminal, which may escalate to death sentences. All electronic outlets have been asked to ensure that they mark their electronic gadgets bought from them at the counter. This, the DCI said, will make it hard for criminals to hawk them and easier for investigative agencies to track and identify. Members of the public possessing suspicious gadgets have been urged to report the case at the nearby police station or at the DCI offices.
