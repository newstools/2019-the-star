A team of county and state officials will be formed to tackle issues bedevilling traders in the Sh475 million Karatina market in Nyeri county. The market was constructed by the national government and handed over to the county government. It was commissioned by President Uhuru Kenyatta in November last year after eight years of waiting. Some traders say they are disadvantaged by virtue of their location. They have accused the county government of failing to enforce products zoning. Two of the three floors have many unoccupied spaces after some vendors declined to take up stalls, citing unregulated business. Those on upper floors claim they sell similar commodities with those in open areas. They expressed fears of disease outbreak due to poor waste disposal and lack of proper drainage. County commissioner David Kipkemei admitted that there were issues that needed to be addressed but said they had been blown out of proportion. He visited the facility yesterday accompanied by members of the County Development and Implementation Coordination Committee. "From our initial findings, the challenges here are not as much as had been indicated,” Kipkemei. Kipkemei sought to assure residents that there will be no disease outbreak as no sewer is open. He urged the county government to zone the market appropriately so every trader can enjoy an equal chance of doing business. Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua, however, insists that there is a problem in the market and vowed to have the traders return in the open area if the challenges are not addressed. He urged Governor Mutahi Kahiga to visit the market and fix the problems. The governor said he was ready and willing to talk with the traders to come up with a lasting solution. (Edited by F'Orieny)
