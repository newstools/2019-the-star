The Nyeri county government has appointed crop inspectors in each of the eight subcounties to enforce potato regulations. Agriculture CEC James Wachihi said the officials will attend training to be conducted by the Agriculture and Food Authority on the regulations which are yet to be gazetted. “After gazettement, they will have been protected by the law and will be in a position to stop any vehicle carrying potatoes in extended bags and take the culprits to the police,” he said. Wachihi spoke during a sensitisation workshop for stakeholders on Irish Potato Regulations 2019 at Wambugu ATC on Tuesday. Stakeholders complained that Nyeri was lagging behind in implementation of the regulations. They said other potato growing counties are complaining that most extended potato bags are from Nyeri. “I have visited farms and farmers are very aware of the regulations and we are on board,” Wachihi said. He said farmers say potatoes are bought in extended bags at the farm but later repackaged to evade law enforcers. “We are not only dealing with the potatoes that we grow but we are also a transit county, with some of the potatoes coming from areas like Elgeyo Marakwet passing through the county to Eastern region,” he said. Wachihi said the county will map out its entry and exit points with the help of the Interior Ministry to arrest the violators. The CEC called on all stakeholders to step up their efforts and ensure everyone is playing their role and following the law. The regulations are meant to ensure that potatoes are sold in kilos and not in extended bags that exploit farmers. Nyeri is among the 17 counties engaged in commercial potato farming. The head of food crops directorate at AFA, Leonard Kubok, said since independence, food crops have not had such regulations. The chairman of Nyeri Potato Cooperative Society Lee Waithaka said farmers are ready to help enforce the law.
