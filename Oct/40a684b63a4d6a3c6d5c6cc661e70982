Coach Meshack Senge has asked Strathmore University Gladiators to focus if they are to get a result in today's match against Greensharks at the City Park Stadium. The students have 10 points and sit eighth in the ten-team league. They beat Sharks 4-2 in the first leg and a double could be on the cards if the students show up. Their season struggles are attributed to the loss of nine of the 11 first-team players. Senge said they will play a complete game and hopes results go their way. "Our plan remains the same—one game at a time. I have young and talented players but they have to stay focused on the entire match. Either way, two things are for sure. We may not win the league but we will also not suffer relegation," he said. Striker Festus Onyango is an injury doubt and Senge remains uncertain of his participation. "Festus has had a finger fracture but just came back. I am not so sure if he will be available. Anything is possible but his chances are minimal." Despite the league looking won already according to Sharks' Ben Owaga, a top-three finish is within their reach. He wants his team to rediscover their excellent first leg form. The third-placed side have 20 points and will need to return to winning ways following 1-0 loss against Sailors last Sunday. "If you look at the standings, one team is already a winner. This league is won in the first leg. We continue to push for second or third place. It is difficult playing teams that are fighting relegation and therefore, we will have to draw inspiration from our satisfactory performance in the first part of the season. They are talented and we won't underrate them." Either way,  winning will make no changes in position. The students will close the gap to within three points with seventh placed United States International University USIU-A Mashujaa with a victory.
