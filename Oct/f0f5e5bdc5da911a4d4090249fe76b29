Busia MCAS and county staff want to get fit and the county plans to build a gym for them and hire a physiotherapist. Burumba ward MCA Moses Ochieng said it would cost about Sh2.5 million to build a fitness centre in the assembly compound and equipping it would cost less than Sh3 million. The Culture and Sports Committee recommended it and the assembly unanimously adopted the recommendation and six others on Tuesday. It's contained in a report on the last county assembly games. Busia has 53 MCAs. Deputy Speaker Lawrence Okaale said a gym within assembly precincts would help members keep fit and avoid contracting diabetes, heart disease and other non-communicable diseases. They are linked to obesity, an unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle. Florence Ologi (nominated) said a qualified physiotherapist should be employed to help with training. Nancy Okademi (nominated) said the gym would improve the performance of the Busia Assembly team in the County Assemblies Sports Association Games. Ochieng, a professional fitness instructor, said equipment would cost less than Sh3 million. Cynthia Mutere (nominated) said the gym will help improve her skills in the shot-put in the CASA games. Other recommendations included increasing funding for the games, rewarding outstanding performers, availing of medical practitioners for team preparation and buying sports equipment on time. Angela Nafula (nominated) called on the ad hoc committee to ensure uniforms fir the players. (Edited by V. Graham)
