 The national cricket team registered their first win of the ongoing ICC World Twenty20 Qualifiers with a 46 runs win over Bermuda yesterday. After falling to Scotland and Netherlands in their first two matches of the campaign, Kenya needed to win yesterday’s match and did that by bowling out Bermuda for 93 in their pursuit for 138. Dhiren Gondaria was the star with the bat with a 67 ball 85 to lead Kenya to 138 for 4. In reply, the Americans representatives struggled against the Kenyan spinners with all but two of their wickets falling to the spinners. Collins Obuya was the peak of the bowlers with 4 for 27 from 3.5 overs. Skipper Shem Ngoche and Rakep Patel also spanned the match away from Bermuda with 2 for 15 and 2 for 18. Delray Rawlins (37), Janeiro Tucker (22) and George O’Brien (6) were the only batsmen to have stuck on the wicket for some time as the other batsmen struggled with spin. Kenya began the match on a sour note when opener Alex Obanda was sent parking with the only two on the board for a golden duck. Opener Irfan Karim could only add 27 for the second wicket with Gondaria. But after Karim was dismissed for 15, Gondaria lost Obuya immediately for four with the board on 41. He added 15 with Patel before the immediate former skipper was caught on 11. Gondaria, who hit one six and six boundaries, then put on an unbeaten stand of 72 with Rushab Patel. Bermuda’s inning received early blow with three batsmen back in the pavilion inside 13 balls with only seven runs scored. Rawlins and Tucker lifted their fortunes in a 59 runs stand for the fourth wicket. But after Rawlins was dismissed by Rakep, Bermuda never recovered losing wickets at regular intervals.
