Debate on the Punguza Mizigo Bill failed to take place in Lamu county as no MCA seconded it. Hongwe ward MCA James Komu tabled the Bill on the floor of the assembly on Wednesday but failed to get a seconder. According to Assembly Standing Orders, if a Bill lacks a seconder, it stands suspended for six months after which it’s re-tabled in the Assembly for another attempt. With its October 15 deadline, the Lamu assembly has effectively rejected the Bill. Komu said MCAs saw numerous gaps including the clause proposing the reduction of constituencies which would affect all wards across Kenya. “Even before I introduced the Bill, I knew I would lose. You can’t propose a reduction of constituencies and expect the very people who will be affected to support you,” he said. Nominated MCA Amina Kale said a bill such as the Punguza Mizigo one has no space in the assembly. Kale said she will not support any initiative that seeks to demean women leadership positions in the country. “Punguza Mizigo wants to scrap women and nominated positions. It basically wants to lock out women from leadership. The bill is selfish and unfair and I'm glad the assembly rejected it,” Kale said. Nominated MCA Salim Busaidy said the Bill would undermine devolution by reducing the number of wards hence poor service delivery at the grassroots. A similar scenario was experienced in Nyamira and Kirinyaga counties last month. Lamu county now joins the growing list of counties that have rejected Punguza Mizigo Bill including Nairobi, Mandera, Kiambu, Nyeri, Siaya, Homa Bay, Murang’a Nakuru, Makueni, Kirinyaga and Nyamira counties. Only Uasin Gishu county endorsed the Bill which needs to be passed by 24 county assemblies for it to be tabled in the National Assembly and Senate for approval. If successful, the bill will finally be presented to the president for assent.
