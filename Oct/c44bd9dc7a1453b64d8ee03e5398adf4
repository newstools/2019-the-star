Abdi Ibrahim Hassan Guyo has been retained as the Majority Leader of the County Assembly of Nairobi. The Jubilee MCAs had a closed-door meeting on Wednesday with party secretary general Raphel Tuju following last week’s chaos and fracas in the assembly following the return of Beatrice Elachi as the assembly speaker. The legislators were locked in the meeting which lasted almost three hours. Addressing the media after the meeting, Tuju dismissed claims of receiving a letter from Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko which had been circulating in media platforms. The letter had suggested that Tuju replaced Guyo with Mark Ndung’u, the Maringo MCA. Tuju also said that at a later date, Elachi will be invited to a meeting with the Jubilee MCAs to discuss the chaos which transpired last week. The status quo in the Jubilee party leadership remains with Guyo as the Majority Leader and Waithera Chege as the Majority Whip.
