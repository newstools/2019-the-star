Counties' expenditure on salaries has broken the legal cap of 35 per cent of their revenues, a situation the Controller of Budget says is detrimental to development. Of the 47 counties, only five maintained their staffing costs below the set threshold. Apart from Tana River, Marsabit, Turkana, Mandera and Kilifi, the other counties spent excessively on wages in disregard of the law. As a result, county governments spent Sh162.79 billion in 2018-19 which equals to Sh11.7 billion more compared with Sh151.09 billion they spent in 2017-18. Overall, the personnel costs translated to 47 per cent of the counties’ total expenditure, eliciting fear that development is at stake. Acting Budget boss Stephen Masha flagged the expense saying “the increase in wage bill is unsustainable and will crowd out spending on key development activities.” The Public Finance Management (County Governments) Regulations, 2015 set a limit of the county expenditure on wages and benefits at 35 per cent of the county’s total revenue. “The expenditure on personnel emoluments should be contained at sustainable levels in compliance with the law,” the financial year 2018/19 report reads. The report shows Nakuru, Baringo, Nyamira and Homa Bay have hired more workers, posting the highest wage bill percentages at 58.4, 57.5, 56 and 54.5 per cent respectively. Turkana, Mandera, and Kilifi reported the least proportions at 29.2 per cent, 24.2 per cent and 21.1 per cent respectively. Embu spent over 55 per cent of its budget on salaries while Elgeyo Marakwet and Kisii had 53 per cent and 52 per cent respective share of their resources going towards paying staff. Garissa spending on staff costs was 49 per cent; Kirinyaga (51 per cent), Lamu (50.1 per cent), Machakos (51 per cent), Uasin Gishu (48.6 per cent), (Muranga (48.1 per cent), Siaya (48 per cent), Meru (47.4 per cent), and Kiambu  (47.6 per cent). Nairobi’s spending on wages was 46 per cent, Laikipia (45.8 per cent), Nyeri (45 per cent), Migori (45 per cent), Nandi (44.8 per cent) with Taita and Kisumu at 44 per cent each. Tharaka Nithi also spent 44 per cent of its revenue for the financial year on staff as did Kericho (43 per cent), Vihiga (42.8 per cent), Kakamega (42 per cent), Mombasa (41.4 per cent), Makueni (41.7 per cent), and Kitui (41.5 per cent). Narok, Wajir, Trans Nzoia, and Kwale exceeded the cap by between two to three per cent of their expenditure for the financial year. “The County Public Service Boards should establish and adopt an optimal staffing structure in order to ensure a sustainable wage bill,” Masha advised. Governors have maintained that the wage crisis is a result of poor staffing structure, adding that some of the roles are inevitable. Council chairman Wycliffe Oparanya cited the administrative units at the ward level, similar to the national government’s regional administrative structure. “This issue needs a serious discussion without involving politics. We are helpless. We need to come together with the national government and make a decision as a country. “We need to look at whether the structures are sustainable and what we can do differently. This will be a healthy debate. We need to get it right,” he said. Despite President Uhuru Kenyatta’s orders against spending on non-essentials like benchmarking trips and workshops, counties still spent more money on travel. Acting Treasury CS Ukur Yatani recently reiterated the cost-cutting measures extending the same to limit the use of government vehicles and spending on advertisements, newspapers, and communication. The devolved units expended a total of Sh16.2 billion on domestic and foreign travel, an increase of 42.5 per cent above the Sh11.36 billion they spent last year. The report reveals that county government executives and MCAs spent Sh13.44 billion on domestic travel and Sh2.75 billion on foreign travel. Machakos spent the highest at Sh642.9 million followed by Nairobi and Kisii at Sh641 million and Sh597 million respectively. The least spenders were Kirinyaga (Sh167.2 million), Samburu (Sh116.9 million), and Elgeyo Marakwet at Sh110.65 million respectively. “The high expenditure on travel, which is a non-core activity, may lead to reduced expenditure on key development programmes,” Masha said. He argued that high expenditure on non-core activities is contrary to the requirements of Article 201 of the Constitution which requires public money to be used in a prudent and responsible way. “COB recommends that expenditure on non-core activities, such as travelling, should be rationalised in order to free funds for the implementation of key development programmes,” the Budget boss said. Apart from the travel expense, counties’ operation and maintenance costs stood at Sh90 billion, costs which show that chunks of the devolved units’ income go to non-essentials. Nairobi City, Kiambu, and Mombasa are among the top spenders having utilised Sh29.4 billion, Sh14.26 billion, and Sh12.53 billion on recurrent costs. The lowest recurrent expenditure was recorded by Isiolo, Samburu, and Lamu counties at Sh4.28 billion, Sh4.18 billion, and Sh2.90 billion respectively. This left counties with a paltry Sh107 billion to stock hospitals, build feeder roads and provide water to residents.
