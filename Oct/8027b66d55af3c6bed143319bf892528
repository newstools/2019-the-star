Five emloyees of Real Estate Security Guards Company have been charged with assaulting a former employee for insisting on19 days' pay. A Kibera court heard on Thursday that Gilbert Rotich had been employed by the firm and decided to quit shortly finding a better job. The company had not cleared his 19-day salary  and he constantly sent text messages to his former boss asking on how, when and where he will get his salary arrears, the court was told. Rotich said he was given a date to collect his dues. He did not know that director Willykster Mwendwa had been offended by his constant messages, the court heard. Rotich visited the company's offices in Kilimani on September 11 and was directed to wait for the director at the office’s backyard. "A distance from the backyard, some men were slaughtering a goat and a security guard was resting in a plastic chair," court documents read. "Then a woman came from the back yard and asked him why he had been sending her messages every time." “I told her that I had only arrived to pick my dues,” Rotich reported to the police. The manager informed him that the company owed him nothing as his arrears were used to cater for his rent during the 19 days of employment, police records read. The manager, Rotich said, then ordered the men who were slaughtering the goat and the security guard to 'work on him' and get his mobile phone. “They kicked me and beat me up, others stepped on my body and ordered that I hand over my phone to them. They took took my phone and handed it to her,” he told the police. Mwendwa was charged alongside Paul Senteu, Caleb Mwendwa, Robert Okiru and Samwel Makori, all employees of the company on Ole Dume Road in Dagoretti in Nairobi county. They denied the charges before senior resident magistrate Boaz Ombewa. They were released on a bond of Sh20,000 and Sh10,000 bail each withsurety of the same amount. Ombewa directed the matter to be mentioned on October 21 and heard on December 16. Edited by R.Wamochie
