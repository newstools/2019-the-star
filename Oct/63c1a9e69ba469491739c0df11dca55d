With tough away matches at the City Park to look forward to, Lakers captain Linah Barasa is bullish that the team can maintain their unbeaten run irrespective of the venue. The Kisumu-based side have made Kisumu Simba Stadium a fortress this season. High profile teams have suffered there with Strathmore falling 3-2 while 10-time African and defending champions Telkom could only manage a 2-2  draw. With the home comfort gone, the newbies face a tricky spell.  Apart from their match against Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology that looks easy on paper, Lakers will face United States International University USIU-A Spartans,  Sliders and Sailors before the ultimate game against Telkom. The young talented side have defied odds to win three times and draw six times to comfortably sit fourth on the log with 15 points. Lakers will gain confidence from their only away win of the season, against  Kenyatta University Titans in April and Barasa said Lakers have nothing to fear. "We still expect to win on astroturf. We've been there and won some matches so I don't think it will disadvantage us. Let it be known that we are not ready to lose any game, we are targeting nothing but wins," said Barasa. She added that anything is possible and the team cannot afford to relax as they work for a top-three finish. The team is banking on the attack to achieve targets. "The league is not yet won. We can only accept this when it's done. Our strike force is good and will deliver. Relaxing is not in our schedule. Finishing second or third will not be an underachievement. Our strategy works best for us and we'll stick to it," she added. With Lakers on the rise, it will not be surprising to see them challenge for the title next season just one year after making their debut in the top flight.
