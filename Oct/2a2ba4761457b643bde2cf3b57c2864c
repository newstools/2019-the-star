Gor Mahia captain Kenneth Muguna has cited 'personal reasons' for his reported one-week absence from club duties. Since featuring in the Harambee Stars 1-0 loss to Mozambique in an international friendly played a week ago, Muguna gave the club's assignments a wide berth. His assistant at the club Joash Onyango who clocked the full 90 minutes in theÂ  Mambas match is also understood to have failed to return. Yesterday, Muguna cleared the air on why he elected to desert club duties and trashed reports that he had not served the management with a notice to stay away for a week. He also denied absconding training to protest lack of timely payment of their salaries and allowances. "It's true I have not trained with the team the whole of last week due to personal reasons. I raised the same to the management and they were aware that I will not be available. I am not in a position to comment on Joash's case. My absence has got nothing to do with money. If it was the case I would have sorted that with the club chairman." said the Kogallo skipper. The former Western Stima man, however, said he is keen to resume training in the course of the week. He missed yesterday's match against Kariobangi Sharks staged at the Afraha Stadium. "I will return in the course of the week. I have not gone AWOL as I read online.I am looking to report back and pick from where I left." he added. The decision of the duo is understood to have angered coach Steven Polack who hinted on relieving them of their captaincy roles. In their absence, Polack elevated former Nzoia Sugar centre half Joachim Oluoch to fill in the void. "I am not worried about being demoted. Being the captain is just but an added advantage.I am at Gor Mahia to play and that's the top priority for me."Muguna finished.
