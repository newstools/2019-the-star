Wales missed out on a first World Cup final in gut-wrenching fashion as Handre Pollard's 76th-minute penalty snatched victory for South Africa in a gripping semi-final to set up a showdown against England. The first half was a war of attrition, three Pollard penalties giving the Springboks a 9-6 lead as they sought to overpower Wales up front and kick them into submission. Dan Biggar dragged Wales level with a penalty early in the second half, but then Damien de Allende burst through the Welsh defensive line to put South Africa 16-9 ahead. Wales sensed they had to go for broke and, after boldly opting for a scrum rather than a penalty in front of the posts against their hulking opponents, they worked the ball wide for Josh Adams to dive over for a converted try that made it 16-16. That set up a captivating final 10 minutes in which Wales drove forward in desperate search of the score that would keep alive their hopes of ending Warren Gatland's reign with the ultimate prize in rugby. But they were denied as Pollard struck a fourth and match-winning penalty in the 76th minute. While South Africa can look forward to a final against England here in Yokohama next Saturday, Gatland's final game as Wales head coach will be the third-place play-off against his native New Zealand in Tokyo on Friday.
