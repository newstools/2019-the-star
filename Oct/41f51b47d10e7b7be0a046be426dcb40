The hearing of a case in which an ex-mistress of businessman Joseph Kori and a car hire dealer are charged with murdering Kori's wife Mary Wambui will commence at a Kiambu court this morning. Detectives believe Kori's ex-mistress, Judy Wangui, plotted the murder. The widower,  Kori, has recorded a statement with the police supporting the claims, and the State has picked him as a witness as detectives seek to strengthen the murder case against Wangui and Michael Mathenge, the car hire dealer. On April 2, 2019, the prosecution, through State counsel Christine Ndombi,  applied to have Wangui and her co-accused, Mathenge, remanded until the matter is heard and determined. But Justice Christine Meoli granted each of them a bond of Sh5 million with alternative of cash bail of Sh2 million. This was after defence lawyers led by Cliff Ombeta successfully opposed prosecution request to deny their clients bond. Wangui and Mathenge have since denied killing Wambui at the Wangui's residence at Four Ways Junction Estate on the Kiambu-Nairobi Road on the night of January 26, 2019. They allegedly clobbered her on the head with a pressure cooker before strangling her. “The first accused (Wangui) had parted ways with Joseph Kori Karue. The first accused was hence targeting him and his family,” detective Oliver Nabonwe told Lady Justice Christine Meoli in a sworn affidavit. Detectives noted that the murder took place at Wangui’s residence, where there was a bloodstained knife, bloodstained clothes and swabs on the floor, as well as the clothes used to wrap the body.
