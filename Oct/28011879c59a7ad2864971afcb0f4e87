Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says goalkeeper Alisson could be fit to face Leicester on Saturday but expects him to return against Manchester United. Alisson, 26, has missed nine games in all competitions after suffering a calf injury in the Premier League opener against Norwich on 9 August. Liverpool host Red Bull Salzburg in the Champions League today. After the game against Leicester and the international break, they face United at Old Trafford on October 20. “There are two opinions,” said Klopp. “One is Alisson’s and the other is the medical department, which is more cautious. We have to wait and see. In training, he looks really well but it was a serious injury and we don’t want to take any risks.” “We have to see for Leicester and the Manchester United game ­— probably 100% but we will see.” Meanwhile, the Football Association is investigating an allegation of racial discrimination during Saturday’s Championship game between Charlton Athletic and Leeds United. It is understood the incident involved Leeds goalkeeper Kiko Casilla and Charlton forward Jonathan Leko. Referee John Brooks is believed to have included the allegation in his match report after Charlton’s 1-0 win. The FA will now speak to both clubs and the players allegedly involved. A statement from the Addicks said: “Charlton Athletic can confirm that an allegation of racial abuse directed at Jonathan Leko by an opposing player during Saturday’s game against Leeds United was reported to referee John Brooks. “The club will support Leko throughout the process and will not be making any further comment until the investigation is concluded.” Under rules introduced for the 2019-20 season, the minimum suspension for a player found guilty of an aggravated breach of the FA’s discrimination rules will be six matches, which can be increased depending on any additional aggravating factors.
