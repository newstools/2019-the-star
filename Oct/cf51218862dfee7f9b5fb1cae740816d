Tomorrow World Marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge hits the Vienna streets for another record attempt. He wants to be the first runner to cover the 42 kilometres in less than two hours in the INEOS 1:59 challenge. Kipchoge is determined to make it and has been training hard for the last year. From him we learn that confidence is key before undertaking any task. Many of us give up before we start simply for fear of failure, fear of the unknown or discouragement from family and friends. Second, you must prepare, whetherÂ  at the individual, corporate or state level. You don't just wake up and take on a task you are ill-prepared for. Kipchoge has been up and down the hills of Iten in rigorous training, adhered to strict discipline and a well-planned diet. He has forgone many pleasures and relaxation to focus on his goal. Third, being a team player. Kipchoge is the one tasked to break the record but he has not been training alone, nor will he be alone on the track. He picked the best to be among his 41 pacesetters. In life, individuals and countries must benchmark with the best. All the best, Kipchoge. Make Kenya proud.
