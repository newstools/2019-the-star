The new Anglican bishop of Maseno South Diocese has called on the church to support the fight against corruption and the Building Bridges Initiative. Bishop-elect Simon Onyango said the church should question huge donations it receives during harambees, especially when contributions surpass the monthly salaries of the givers. “As a church, ACK has already agreed to help in tackling corruption and the best way is through questioning the contributions we get,” Onyango said. He urged Christians across the country to support the BBI to end political animosity during elections. “We need harmony between Kenyans and politicians in every election cycle, especially after voting which we hope will be covered in the report,” Onyango said. He said the handshake between President Uhuru Kenaytta and ODM leader Raila Odinag brought peace after the hotly contested 2017 elections. Onyango spoke on Saturday at St John ACK Church in Migori town after he was elected the third bishop following the early retirement of James Ochiel. Onyango was elected at the ACK cathedral in Homa Bay county and will head Homa Bay, Migori, Kisii and Nyamira counties. A total of 16 representatives from the four counties and seven from the national office elected Onyango who vied against Phillip Omwaga and Joshua Agulo. Earlier, five candidates had shown interest for the seat and two were disqualified with the three making it to the final process.
