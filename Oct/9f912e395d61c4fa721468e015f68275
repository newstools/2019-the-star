Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa's family members have complained about being denied access to the politician, hours after she was arrested. Her lawyer, Jared Magolo, was on Wednesday also denied access to his client and by 10am, he had to leave after being barred from accessing the station, which is inside the port. Jumwa was arrested together with her domestic worker, Samuel Charo, gardener known only by the name Katana, and her husband, Jeff Okot at her Malindi house at 1.40am. Her first born son, Karisa Kalume Karisa, 26, said a contingent of police officers in eight Land Cruisers broke their gate and ordered them out. "We followed them after they handcuffed Jeff and bundled them into the vehicles. One of the vehicles had my aunties and sisters, and they went up to Watamu and they were instructed to go back home," he said. Nominated Senator Christine Zawadi said they have no idea what was happening. Accompanied by Kaloleni MP Paul Katana and Jumwa's younger sister, Norah Karisa Katana, they tried to persuade the police to let them access the station to no avail. Juma Konde, Jumwa's cousin, said it was wrong for police to hold them in suspense. "She is being held incommunicado, and her rights are being violated. We need to see her and brief her over what is happening. We believe this has a direct relation to tomorrow's elections at Ganda ward," he said. Deputy port police OCPD Benjamin Kemboi said they were recording statements awaiting to forward the files to the DPP for further directions. Port OCPD Patrick Lobolia confirmed four suspects are in custody, with investigations in relation to the Ganda incident on Tuesday that led to the death of one person. Magolo said he was looking at the possibility of filing for habious corpeius to have her produced in court.
