The girl is a Form Three student at Lamu Girls High School The 17-year-old Mercy Wairimu Ng’ang’a is suspected to have sneaked out of school during a blackout. Principal Jamila Mohamed refused to comment, dismissively saying that she is not allowed to speak to the media. She referred reporters to the County Director of Education Joshua Kaaga who confirmed that the girl was missing from school. “I have gone to the school and they confirmed that they didn’t issue her with leave out chit. That means she sneaked out during the blackout. Police are on the case,” Kaaga said. County Commissioner Irungu Macharia said teachers had filed a report of the missing girl at the Lamu Police station and that a search for her was underway. “She went missing on the night of October 19 when there was a blackout at the school. She is not at her home but we are following leads that she might have left school to stay with a friend at Kashmir area of Langoni, here in Lamu town. We will find her,” Macharia said. The girl’s father, Peter Ng’ang’a, learnt of his daughter’s disappearance after teachers called to ask if she was at home. Ng’ang’a, appealed to anybody who knows her whereabouts to help find her. "She is my first child and has never had issues with discipline. I am shocked. I hope she is found to resume her studies.” The girl’s mother, Margaret Wairimu, appealed to whoever might be holding her to free her. “It’s been three days and still no word of her whereabouts. I am worried sick. I keep imagining she is in some sort of danger. I just hope she is safe,” she said.
