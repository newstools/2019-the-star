ICT CS Joe Mucheru has appointed Charity Kochalle to the Kenya Film Classification Board. Kochalle takes over from his late husband Robert Kochalle who died on May 2018 while a member of the KFCB board. The replacement comes after uproar from Kenyans on Twitter over the name of the late Kochalle appearing on the list. KFCB boss Ezekiel Mutua was however quick to correct the error, saying that the issue was too small to be blown out of proportion. Mucheru in a gazette notice had reappointed Kochalle to continue serving in the KFCB board for another three years. The other members appointed to the board include Gathoni Kung'u and Nerreah Alouch Okanga. The three will serve for a term of three years which will be effected from October 21.
