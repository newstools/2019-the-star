Elgeyo Marakwet senator Kipchumba Murkomen has weighed in again on the vexed Arror dam issue. Murkomen via his twitter account said Arror river needs a dam after it became violent following heavy rains. "Arror River has become violent. Wants to be dammed urgently," he said as he shared a 10 second video of the raging waters . Murkomen's post left Kenyans divided as some supported his idea while others opposed it. @FabiusMulongo said "Who then should dam them?..this whole thing of leaders becoming keyboard warriors and typing at the comfort of their seats in their homes should just come to an end, people are suffering your excellency, just rally those concerned and solve this issue,I know you can." "Adui ya msitu. Murkomen you have cut down all the trees in the forest/the slopes no vegetation to slow down the rain water check the colour of the water, Red sediments, too much top soil being washed away will render the land useless- unproductive," @JKen_O said. @Obi_kenya001 said "But your people will have to suffer because you leaders redirected the money meant for the dam to your pockets. Sasa wacha hizo mifuko zenu zizuilie mafuriko." Here are other tweets on the same; Last week, a section of politicians from Rift Valley petitioned President Uhuru Kenyatta to reconsider the decision on Arror and Kimwarer dams. The politicians said Uhuru should review the decision to scale down the funding on the Arror dam and the move to stop the construction work on the Kimwarer dam in the county. In September, President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered the cancellation of the Sh22.2 billion Kimwarer dam contract. The President at the same time allowed Arror dam to continue after its design was scaled down from 96 metresÂ to 60 metres. "The optimised dam will be technically viable since it will only require about 250 acres and cost Sh15.4 billion with power and Sh13.1 billion without power. The dam was previously estimated to cost Sh28.3 billion," read a statement from statehouse.
