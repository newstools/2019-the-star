Slovan Bratislava’s next Europa League match against Wolverhampton Wanderers will be played behind closed doors after the Slovakian side’s fans were found guilty of racist behaviour, Uefa have said. During Bratislava’s qualifying play-off first-leg win over Greek side PAOK in August, their fans unfurled a banner and sang chants that were deemed to be racist by Uefa’s Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body. “The next Uefa competition home match to be played behind closed doors will be the Europa League group stage match between Slovan Bratislava and Wolverhampton Wanderers FC on October 24,” European soccer’s governing body said in a statement after dismissing an appeal. Bratislava were fined 50,000 euros for the racist behaviour of their supporters and an additional 41,750 euros for ‘blocking of stairways, throwing of objects, invasion of the field of play and insufficient organisation.’ Bratislava are currently top of Group K with four points after two matches while Wolves are a point behind in third.
