A nurse and a senior policeman are hospitalised in Embu, each claiming to have been attacked by the other. Police say they are not sure who between the two is telling the truth. Embu county police commander Daniel Rukunga has ordered investigations. Runnyenjes hospital nurse Mustafa Hamisi said inspector Alex Munyua of Runyenjes police station confronted him while in civilian clothes and started harassing him without identifying himself. Hamisi alleged he was assaulted by Kinyua at Runyenjes market and was rushed to the subcounty hospital after the Sunday night attack. He and witnesses say the policeman confronted him and tried to arrest him for unknown reasons. Hamisi said officers in the company of Â Kinyua descended on him and battered him. However Kinyua accuses the health worker of resisting arrest and badly injuring him. Runyenjes police boss Benjamin Muhia denied his officer was in the wrong. He said Kinyua was arresting Hamisi when he turned violent and a fight broke out. He said the officer lost two teeth and was admitted to Kieni Hospital. The police chief dismissed claims that Hamisi was tortured in police cells. Embu Kenya National Union of Nurses branch secretary Joseph Ngwasi condemned the attack and called on the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to get to the bottom of the matter. He denied that Hamisi resisted arrest, noting that he is seeking justice.
