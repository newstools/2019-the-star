Embu residents have urged the government to erect guard rails on an Embu-Kirinyaga highwayâ€™s bridge where several lives have been lost. Residents and motorists using the Nairobi-Meru highway are being exposed to grave danger of plunging into the swollen Rupingazi River on the border of Embu and Kirinyaga counties. The guard rails were destroyed after a car rammed into them a few months ago. Youth leader Eliud Njiru said scores of lives have been lost on the spot after drivers lost control of their vehicles. He said there were no barriers to prevent vehicles from plunging into the river. Motorist Fredrick Nyaga urged road users to exercise caution while approaching the bridge. Nyaga appealed to Kirinyaga and Embu leaders to come together and demand a permanent solution to the problem. Njiru said that the stretch of the highway from PI to Embu town should be expanded and a wall erected to act as a barrier to keep vehicles from plunging into the river. Residents further want the road to be well-marked to improve safety for road users.
