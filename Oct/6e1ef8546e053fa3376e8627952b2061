A son of a senior politician says he finds it hard to do music for fear of his father. The son appeared at a recent event in kinky hair and looked drunk. He works closely with and is a great friend of a famous gengetone music group in the country. "I have done five tracks and what's remaining is to leave dad's home for my career to blossom," he said. Speaking to Word is on Saturday, he said his father would angrily decide to throw him out the house if he learns he is doing music. He has plans to first finish school and get a house far from his dad. Having done this, he will be free to do his music without fear. "Doing it now can be dangerous because if dad learns, that will be my end," he said. "Dad wanted to me to do economics, but I feel singing is part of me."
