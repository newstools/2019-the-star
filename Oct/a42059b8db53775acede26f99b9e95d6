Detectives investigating the recent murder of a woman and her daughter on South B estate, Nairobi, have yet to receive results of the toxicology conducted on the daughter a couple of weeks ago. A senior police officer on Tuesday told The Star that though preliminary investigations had indicated that 47-year-old Catherine Nyaguthii might have killed her ageing mother Judith Mwai, 74, before ending her own life. He added, however, that toxicology was important for confirmation. Regional police commander Philip Ndolo said the analysis of potential toxins was crucial to find out whether Nyaguthii poisoned her mother before strangling her to death and if she also took poison. Ndolo noted that it will take longer to get the results — possibly two to three months or thereabouts. “Toxicology will tell whether the daughter really took poison and if she poisoned her elderly mother before strangling her to death,” he said. The police boss said that on September 21, Nyaguthii called the police on toll-free-line 112 to report that she had killed. This was hours before their bodies were discovered in their four-bedroom family house on Golden Gate estate on a Monday morning. He said investigations revealed that the voice of the woman who informed the police of the killing was identified as Nyaguthii's. "She called police data centre saying she had killed, then went mum. The matter is, however, being investigated by the DCI,” Ndolo said. A postmortem conducted on Judith revealed that she died after she was strangled using a rope. Her body was found inside her bedroom, with a sisal rope around her neck, while that of her daughter was in a separate bedroom. The two were buried at their rural home in Murang'a county. The police interviewed several people, including guards, close relatives, and neighbours. (Edited by F'Orieny)
