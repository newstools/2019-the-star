Governor Cyprian Awiti’s sickness is jeopardising service delivery and public funds in Homa Bay, Senator Moses Kajwang’ has said. The governor has been ailing for a long time. He was recently on a three-month medical leave abroad, and upon returning was admitted locally for a further 26 days. Presiding over a construction fundraiser on Saturday, Kajwang’ accused unnamed employees of misusing funds in the absence of the governor. “We know Awiti is sick but this shouldn’t prevent the government employees from discharging their duties effectively. Residents want their funds channelled to development,” Kajwang’ said. He was speaking at Anding’o Catholic Church in Kabondo Kasipul constituency. Area MP Eve Obara was also present. Kajwang, chairman of the Senate Public Accounts and Investment Committee, accused the county of not planning its development. “It’s two years since we were elected into office, but we haven’t seen Homa Bay's strategic plan. The plan should be put in public for proper implementation of development projects,” Kajwang’ said. Obara asked the county to account for projects carried out in her constituency at the end of every year. “I call on the county government to present a list of projects done for Kabondo Kasipul residents so that we can know,” Obara said. But county chief of staff Eliud Otieno denied the allegations, saying the county had a strategic plan for development. Otieno said the county has a County Integrated Development Plan, from which the Annual Development Plan is drawn. The ADP is used for making the budget. “What the two leaders are saying is not true because we have development plans, which we follow in implementing development projects,” Otieno said. He said they had done many projects in Kabondo Kasipul constituency. “Even the road used by people to travel to this church was constructed by the county government,” he said.
