Kenyans have been encouraged to consume traditional and organic foods to avoid lifestyle diseases like cancer. Kenyans are consuming a lot of chemicals detrimental to their health. The overuse of fertilisers is of particular concern, a senior official with Participatory Ecological Land Use Management (Pelum) Edward Muiruri said. Muiruri asked small-scale farmers to grow traditional vegetables as they do not require chemical inputs. He said the Ministry of Agriculture needs to come up with ways of producing food without destroying the environment. He spoke on Wednesday during World Food Day celebrations at Athwana ward in Tigania. Several NGOs showcased indigenous foods and taught farmers value addition and how to preserve their produce. Muiruri stressed the importance of preserving indigenous "orphan" crops like sorghum, millet, pigeon peas, cowpeas, sweet potato and traditional maize. “Traditional foods are becoming popular in local restaurants as people have started realising how important they are,” he said. Pelum is a union of 55 NGOs and CSOs and works with subsistence farmers, encouraging them to use natural inputs like compost manure. It encourages soil and water conservation, agroforestry, intercropping trees with food crops and water harvesting. The theme for the WFD was healthy diets and targeting zero hunger in the world.
