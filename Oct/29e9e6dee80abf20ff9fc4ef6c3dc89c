Local leaders have raised concerns about heavy rains in parts of Wajir county that have killed one person and at least 900 animals in the past week. The leaders have appealed to the departments of veterinary services and agriculture to urgently respond and save the situation. Some of the most affected areas include Wargadud in Tarbaj subcounty, Elnoor in Eldas subcounty and Gurar, Adadijole, Dinikhu and Bosicha in Wajir North. The situation is replicated in almost all the eight subcounties with carcasses scattered everywhere. On Wednesday a woman died in Gurar in Wajir North subcounty after she was swept away by flash floods. Her body was recovered the following day, some two kilometres downstream from the site of the accident. Bute ward MCA Ismail Aden told the press in Wajir town that it was heartbreaking to see livestock owners continue to lose animals, their only source of livelihood. “We want to appeal to the relevant agencies to immediately hit the ground and stop more deaths by offering drugs to the animals and any other support they might require. We are worried at how animals are dying in their hundreds,” Aden said. Elnoor Tulatula ward MCA Abdullahi said it was unfortunate to lose the livestock that had survived the long drought. Abdullahi said the downpour will only serve to make the lives of the residents who depend on livestock for survival difficult. Livestock farmers who spoke to the press expressed their frustrations at the slow pace of response from the relevant authorities. Abdi Hassan, a herder from Elnoor Tulatula ward, lost 200 goats and has only 50 left after another 250 died during the drought. Wajir county director of veterinary services George Kiprono said they have already sent teams to the sub-counties to assess the situation. The teams will identify what the real causes of the deaths are before embarking on treatment. Kiprono said in most cases animals died of constipation and bloating.
