The International Committee of the Red Cross has terminated the assignment of one of its staffers, following an outcry from the public after he insulted a security guard at Lavington Mall. The man is alleged to have insulted the woman on Sunday as she tried to direct him. The man instead dismissed her using abusive words and vulgarÂ language. The scene was captured on camera and complaints were made on Twitter, which caught the attention of the organisation. In a statement on Monday, ICRC apologised to the victim and the public for the misconduct of one of their colleagues. "As of this evening, the person's assignment in Kenya has been terminated. We want to again apologise for the disturbance and to anyone who was insulted," the statement read. The decision was reached after the organisation met witnesses as they probed the matter. The organisation has said that it will not allow anyone to ruin a good reputation that it has gained in the country as it offers its humanitarian services in Kenya and the entire region.
