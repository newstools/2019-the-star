United  States International University (USIU) teams won their Premier League ties played at their own backyard to ease their relegation worries. Coach Cliff Owuor still believes all is not lost if his charges can continue the winning run in their remaining fixtures. The Flames beat Africa Nazarene University 71-47 in the women’s tie while the Tigers punished World Hope 46-36 in the men’s match. Fridah Yagomba shot game-high 24 points and Shibeche Sharlette added 18 for USIU to go up 36-19 at the break. Lynn Saliamo hit 20 points for ANU. “It was a good result for us. If we can take two wins from our last five games, we will be safe from the drop,”  said Owuor who is also the national men’s team coach. He, however, admitted that a lot more needs with the Tigers despite their win in a low scoring fixture. It was World Hope who superbly bolted away to a 16-4 lead in the opening stanza. But USIU closed in 19-16 at half time. The home side took the last quarter 19-7 as Larry Shavanga sunk 20 points. Victor Okoth and Eugene Omondi scored 11 each for Hope. At the Kakamega Police, University of Nairobi Dynamites exploded on home girls Western Delight, winning 50-36. They led 27-21 at half-time. UoN coach Kent said: “I travelled with only eight players due to exams and other commitments but they did extremely well winning easily.” In the lower division, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) bagged two points after Upper Hill School failed to show up.
