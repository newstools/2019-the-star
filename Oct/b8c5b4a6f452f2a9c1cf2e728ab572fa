More than 200 health workers in Vihiga risk losing their jobs due to irregular hiring. Governor Wilber Ottichilo said the entire process was not clear and lacked proper documentation for transparency and accountability. Ottichilo said the county had budgeted for 149 workers only. "However, the County Public Service Board by then ruined the entire process by recruiting 380 extra workers," the governor said in a statement on Thursday. He said the extra staff had caused a standoff in salary payment due to increased wage bill. Some 254 workers were hired under unclear circumstances, among whom 146 were offered direct employment and 108 employed without being shortlisted, Ottichilo said. â€œThose that will not feature on the verified list of 3,737 applicants will be discontinued from service together with those who were not shortlisted for interviews." CPSB's list contains 4,690 applicants instead of 3,737, Ottichilo said. "In addition, the list of interviewers was never produced making it difficult for the ad hoc committee to verify the attendance." The Kenya National Union of Nurses had previously told the governor to crack the whip on those who conducted the process and not the workers. An insider told the Star the recruitment was planned and budgeted for in 2018-19 at Sh35 million. The governor, who is currently struggling to control the huge wage bill, must find a way out as the newly recruited health workers wait for their payment. He has, however, assured those who will be discontinued from service that they will be paid for the period they served. Edited by R.Wamochie
