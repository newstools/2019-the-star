A weekly weather forecast from the Kenya Metrological Department has projected heavy rainfall across the counties of Mandera, Wajir and Marsabit Some parts of the country with more than 70mm are expected to experience floods which might lead to road slippery as well as poor visibility. Cumulative moderate rainfall (50-70) mm is expected in some parts of Tana River, Kwale, Embu, Murang’a, Kajiado and Siaya counties. Last week, heavy rains in Mandera killed more than  1,000 goats. The goats had survived a long drought only to be killed by a downpour and heavy flooding on Thursday evening in Gither ward of Mandera West sub-county. The county government and the National Drought Management Authority have been distributing relief rations during the dry spell. Turkana, Samburu, Garissa, Narok and Baringo counties will receive less than 20mm of rainfall. Moderately warm daily-mean temperatures of between 20-30 degrees Celsius are expected in some parts of Nairobi, Machakos, Narok, Kisumu, Busia, Vihiga, Nyamira and Kisii. Heavy rainfalls have been reported in many parts of the country for the past week. Motorists using Kisumu-Kisii highway were last week left stranded after floods swept away a bridge. The residents waited hopelessly to get help when the temporary bridge at Kodada market in  Kasipul Kabondo was swept away by the raging floods.
