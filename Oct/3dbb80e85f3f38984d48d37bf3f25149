Three months down the line, the state is not yet ready to proceed with trial in three tax evasion cases involving businessman Humphrey Kariuki. The court has consequently allowed the prosecution until January 14 to supply the defense with all the 7,500 hard copy documentary evidence. The ruling was made after the prosecution requested for more time to supply all the accused through their defence counsels copies of witness statements and documentary exhibits. Senior assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Vincent Monda told chief magistrate Francis Andayi who is handling one of the cases that the matter should be mentioned on January 14 to enable them time to supply the hard copies. Defence teams will be allowed to visit the Directorate of Criminal Investigations offices between December 5 and January 14 to inspect and verify the original documents to be used in the cases. Similar orders were issued in two other cases before separate courts. Pre-trial conferences failed to begin on 26 September over missing crucial documents to be used by the prosecution. Defence lawyers argued they were unable to proceed with the missing documents supplied in DVDs. Lawyers Kioko Kilukumi and Cecil Miler for Kariuki told the court when they opened the supplied DVDs, not all documents listed in the inventory in court were in them. They argued inconsistencies were numerous, making it difficult for them to prepare their defence.
