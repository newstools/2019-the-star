Residents of Tigania East in Meru have appealed to area the MP to reconstruct the Thiiti bridge that was destroyed by the contractor tarmacking the Mikinduri-Kunati-Gacibine road. They told MP Gichunge Kabeabea the contractor left them with no alternative after demolishing Thiiti bridge. The residents are now forced to use a makeshift bridge made of logs to cross the river. James Mutua said boda boda operators have hiked fares because the road which is under construction is muddy. Mutua said boda boda riders take up to three hours on a journey that previously took between 30 and 45 minutes. “We cannot transport miraa, bananas or cereals. We are stranded here since 7am and you can see it is almost 10am. We must wait for the riders to cross one by one. Some have fallen here and got injured because the road and makeshift bridge are slippery, muddy and thin," he said. Four people were killed by flash floods in the county on Thursday. Francis Saberio said they had warned the contractor not to destroy the only bridge on the permanent river that floods during heavy rain. He said business at Mikinduri and Kunati is dwindling  because there is no link between the two major towns in Tigania East constituency. Patrick Kinyua said they are forced to carry their goods and some clients on their backs or heads to cross over the river.
