Kenya Power has launched a live line maintenance programmeÂ to reduce planned electricity shutdowns, enhance stability of power supply and improve revenue generation. In a statement on Monday, the firm said 32 trucks were flagged off to Kenya Power operational regions across the country. "The company is focused on the provision of quality power supply by strengthening the electricity network and streamlining internal process to improve customer experience and stakeholder confidence," Kenya Power acting managing director and CEO Jared Othieno said. Kenya Power said that since the commencement of the live line programme, the number of planned shutdowns have reduced by approximately 40 per cent. "We believe that improving the reliability of power supply to our customers is crucial in accelerating the development and growth of our country," Othieno said. Some 144 live line maintenance staffers have been trained through the World Bank Funding during the pilot phase.
