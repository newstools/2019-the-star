A group of eight MPs from across the political divide has lauded the 31 counties which have so far rejected the Punguza Mzigo Bill. They are Ngunjiri Wambugu (Nyeri Town), TJ Kajwang' (Ruaraka), Maoka Maore (Igembe North), Mishi Mboko (Malindi), Antony Oluoch (Mathare), Gathoni Wamuchomba (Kiambu Woman Representative) and Abdi Shurie (Balambala). The legislators said they are looking forward to the BBI report, which will be presented to President Uhuru Kenyatta and AU envoy Raila Odinga soon. They vowed to do everything within their mandate as legislators to have Kenyans understand the report. "We will do everything as parliamentarians to get all Kenyans to know the contents of the report," Wambugu said. Oluoch said, "We appreciate the 31 counties which have so far voted to reject the (Punguza Mizigo) Bill. It is like 99 per cent of the assemblies have rejected the initiative." The politicians also faulted a clique of politicians whom they claimed wanted to ride on the failed Punguza Mzigo bid to bolster their 2022 ambitions. “There are political forces that had expected to use Punguza Mzigo as a political tool to divide Kenyans as well as use it to create obstacles against BBI. We hope they have learnt that Kenyans are not for sale,”Wambugu said. Kajwang' dismissed Thirdway Alliance leader Ekuru Aukot's bid to block BBI in court, saying it is an exercise in futility and they are not worried. "His going to court is a matter of his constitutional right. It has no pressure at all on the BBI initiative," Kajwang' said.
