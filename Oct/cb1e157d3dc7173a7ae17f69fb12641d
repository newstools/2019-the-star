Some public health workers collude with their private counterparts to have patients treated privately even when treatment can be done in taxpayers-funded facilities. In Nyeri, Mukurweini sub-county hospital is notorious for sending patients for laboratory tests and other services to private labs, according to county speaker John Kaguchia. Kaguchia, who spoke in Mukurweini on Sunday, said he has been receiving many complaints from residents. The complaints continue despite the county government investing a lot of money in hospitals to ensure that all services are available. “Even as the county government invests a lot of money in the health sector, there are some health workers who are yet to understand that we are doing the investment so that our people can get good services,” the speaker said. Kaguchia said he and the county Health executive alongside MCAs will visit Mukurweini hospital to address the problem. There have been persisted allegations of corrupt medical staff colluding with private clinics to refer patients to their facilities for kickbacks. Governor Mutahi Kahiga is on record as having directed the Health CEC to investigate the allegations for action to be taken against the culprits. The reference of patients for services and treatment to the private sector is a common thing. At Embu Level Five Hospital, patients are referred for laboratory tests, including blood tests, to a particular laboratory in the town. And when a patient requires a blood transfusion, he/she asked to bring donors. Recently, the donors for a certain patient arrived and were told that blood bags were out of stock.
