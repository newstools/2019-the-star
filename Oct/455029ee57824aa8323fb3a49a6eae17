A Moroccan journalist has been sentenced to a year in prison for premarital sex and having an abortion, in a case activists say is part of a crackdown on critical reporters. Hajar Raissouni was arrested with her fiancé as they left a gynaecologist's clinic in the capital, Rabat, in August. The 28-year-old denied the charges, saying she had sought treatment for internal bleeding. Ms Raissouni works for an independent newspaper critical of the authorities. A journalist at the Akhbar Al-Yaoum daily, she denounced the case against her as a "political trial", saying she had been questioned by police about her family and her writing. Wearing a black veil covering her head, Ms Raissouni appeared calm on arrival at the courtroom in Rabat. She and her fiancé, a Sudanese national, denied that an abortion had taken place.
