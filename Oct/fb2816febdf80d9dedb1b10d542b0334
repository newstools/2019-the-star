Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has cancelled leave for all ministry officials in order to boost the security of national examinations. Matiang'i spoke on Monday at the Kenya School of Government during the brief on preparations ahead of the examinations. "We are not going to allow any of our security people, especially the senior ones to take leave. This is the time when we all have to focus on the welfare of our children," CS Matiang'i said. The CS said that the Ministry has put enough measures to safeguard examination papers. He said cases of keys of the containers of examination papers being lost will not be reported this time round. Matiang'i urged the subcounty commissioners to be careful with the keys which they will be handed, adding that excuses will not be tolerated. "There will be no key that will be lost. No deputy county commissioner is going to be allowed to lose a key. There will be no key lost," Matiang'i said. The CS has further said that the 47 county commissioners will be filing security reports daily during the examination period - in the morning and in the evening, which should be sent to his office. Matiang'i said the government has acquired more resources to ensure that the examination is successful across the country. "This year we even have more resources. We even have new aircraft from the police, which means that we will be moving around without any problem at all." In this year's exams, 1,088,987 learners will sit KCPE exams, while 689,746 will sit KCSE exams. KCPE exams will start on October 29 and end on October 31, while KCSE will start on November 1 and end on November 27. The Education ministry said 179,149 teachers will be involved in the exam management. PS Karanja Kibicho said, "CS, I am committing that should this examination leak from Ngao and security perspective out of action that I've done, please sack me."
