The weatherman has warned of strong winds of more than 20 meters per second (m/s) expected in Nairobi, Central and Kajiado regions for the next five days. In a phone interview with the Star, Meteorological services deputy director Samuel Mwangi confirmed strong winds hit Thika town on Tuesday, bringing down billboards. "The strong winds will be experienced all over  Nairobi. Already the stormy winds have fallen billboard to the ground," he said. He advised Kenyans to avoid walking near billboards and trees. Meanwhile, acting director of the Met department, Stella Aura, in an advisory said heavy rainfall (more than 30mm) will be experienced in Siaya, Kisumu, Homabay, Migori, Kisii, Nyamira, Trans Nzoia and Baringo in the next five days. Aura said moderate rainfall is expected in Nairobi, Nyandarua, Laikipia, Nyeri, Kirinyaga and Murang'a. “Moderate rains expected in Nairobi, Nyandarua, Laikipia, Nyeri, Kirinyaga and Murang'a,” she said. The five-day forecast said the coastal strip - Mombasa, Tana River, Kilifi, Lamu, and Kwale - will have depressed rainfall. Temperatures will average 30 degrees Celsius. Temperatures in Garissa and Isiolo will be  as high as 38 degrees Celsius. Aura called for contingency plans and strategies to avert conflicts in the coastal strip and southeastern regions due to the scramble of limited resources. "Human-wildlife and inter-community conflicts over the limited resources are likely to be on the increase in these areas. Contingency plans and strategies should, therefore, be in place to avert such incidences." The Met official said the October rainfall is expected to be well distributed, both in time and space, over the better part of the country except for Northwestern Kenya.
