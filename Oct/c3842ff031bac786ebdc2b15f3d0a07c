Police have been allowed to detain for 15 days a man suspected of axing his wife to death. Appearing before Kibera senior principal magistrate Faith Mutuku, the police said they were not ready to press charges against the accused because they had just begun the investigations. Preliminary investigations into the murder, however, suggest that Geoffrey Kibii, killed his wife following a domestic squabble on Monday. Kibii allegedly killed his wife at their homestead at the border of Waruku and Kangemi within Nairobi county. According to police reports, Kibii disagreed with his wife and a confrontation ensued. In their investigations, the police indicated that Kibii feigned calmness only to attack his wife when she was asleep later that night. Kibii’s wife Mary Waithaka was rescued by neighbours who took her to Kikuyu hospital. A neighbour who came to the scene told police that they had heard the two quarrel but dismissed it. Later that night, they heard her scream but when they got to her house, she was bleeding profusely. “Her head had been chopped into two from the right side of the ear, piercing through to the other side. She was pronounced dead on arrival at Kikuyu Hospital. We suspect that the perpetrator used a mattock,” the police said. Waithaka was 50 while her husband is 60. On Tuesday, the investigating officer requested 15 days to hold Kibii to allow completion of investigations. He told the court that the witnesses have not yet recorded statements with the police and the postmortem report was yet been filed to them. Mutuku ordered that the suspect be detained at Kabete police station and the matter be mentioned on October 30. Edited by R.Wamochie
