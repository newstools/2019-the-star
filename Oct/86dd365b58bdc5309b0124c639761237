Tanzania's President John Magufuli has announced he has shifted his base from the country's commercial capital and largest city, Dar es Salaam, to the capital Dodoma. The move was the brainchild of the country's first President Julius Nyerere. President Magufuli announced the relocation over the weekend while registering as a voter ahead of local elections. "I was in Kitavi region, but I decided to come to my home city, Dodoma, to register my name because this is now my official address,"Â he was quoted saying by the Citizen newspaper. All ministries and key government departments have already relocated to Dodoma, the newspaper reports. Tanzanians are today celebrating the Nyerere Day, a day to honour the nation's founding president.
