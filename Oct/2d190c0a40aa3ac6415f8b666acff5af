With only 13 days left to the Kibra by-election, candidates have intensified their campaigns in a final push to woo residents. Over 100,000 registered voters on November 7 are expected to vote one of the 24 candidates to be the next Kibra MP. The by-election was occasioned by the death of Ken Okoth who succumbed to cancer. Among the leading candidates seeking the Kibra parliamentary seat are; Jubilee's McDonald Mariga, ODM's Bernard Imran Okoth, Ford Kenya's Butichi Khamisi and ANC's Eliud Owalo. Former Raila Odinga's aide Owalo on Friday held a series of meetings with Kibra voters who are volunteering in massive door-to-door campaigns. "This election will be remembered for many years to come because of how we conducted our campaign and won," Owalo said in a tweet on Friday. The ANC candidate headed Raila's 2013 Presidential Campaign serving as Head of the CORD Presidential Campaign Secretariat and Chief Campaign Manager to former Prime Minister. Owalo fell out with Raila during the ODM primaries for Kibra at the 2017 elections and later jumped ship to the ANC party. Mariga on Friday went on a shopping spree at Othaya Market, Kibra accompanied by his supporters. He later unveiled an ambitious trade and infrastructure plan in a move to woo voters ahead of the November 7 by-election. In a 14-point manifesto, Mariga promised street lights, business funds, free education, care centres among other pledges for residents. "Ntaincrease ma development centres za watoi...(I will increase development centres for children)," he said. Butichi was not left behind. He embarked on an aggressive campaign trail on Friday, visiting schools as he distributed success cards to KCPE candidates. The schools he visited include Stara, St Juliet, Green pastures and New adventures. Butichi then held forums convincing parents to vote for him and later addressed Muslims at Makina mosque where they held prayers.
