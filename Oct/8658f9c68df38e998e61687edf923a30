Over 60 women from West Pokot will benefit from free fistula surgery at Kapenguria county referral hospital with help of doctors from United states. Speaking in Kapenguria on Wednesday,  health executive Geoffrey Lipale said that a team of eleven doctors under the umbrella of Saving Mothers will be in the county for one week to offer the services. Lipale said the county has been partnering with doctors from US to help women with various health complications. “The doctors come twice a year to help women with fistula problem and educate them on need to deliver in hospital to help reduce maternal deaths,” he said. He said the number of women suffering from fistula in the county was still high since communities still practice female genital mutilation. He said reconstructive surgery of fistula is expensive and most women suffering from the condition cannot afford due to high poverty levels. “We partner with various well wishers who offer the services for free to help our women live a comfortable life,” he said. One of the expected beneficiaries, Mary Lotiola said that she has stayed with fistula for over 15 years. Lotiola said the condition prevented  her from living a comfortable life after she gave birth to her firstborn at a young age. She said her husband abandoned her and she was forced to raise her child on her own. “I want to thank the doctors for offering the surgery for free and I know I will be able to interact with people freely without shame after the surgery,” she said. Governor John Lonyangapuo said FMG and early marriages contribute to fistula. “Cultural practices have exposed our women to many problems and my government is committed to ensure that the culture does not continue harming them,” he said.
