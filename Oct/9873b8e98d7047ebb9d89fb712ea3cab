Power couple Kate Actress and Phil took time before planning for a baby because of each one's family background. Speaking on their new YouTube channel, Phil said, "Getting a baby is more psychological and I didn't know how my background affected how long we had to wait to get a baby. "I have four other siblings and our dad passed away while I was still a teenager. For me, starting a family, I wanted everything to be in place. That was my biggest challenge." Kate, who already has a 13-year-old son, said, "I really wanted a baby even before the wedding, and my husband being a planner that he is, we delayed. I'm the most impatient person and I kept wondering and got so disappointed and I didn't want to try anymore." Adding, "Because I got mine at just 19, it was such a turnaround, I was depressed, stressed and given up. I didn't know how much that experience affected me. It took me back to the moment when it was just me and my son. The first experience traumatised me." Phil says to start a family needs one to be psychologically and financially ready. "Discuss where both of you are at psychologically. You have to be on the same page and iron out things. Also, financially, babies are expensive. It is important to be ready."
