   Jubilee women leaders in Inua Mama and Embrace have been asked to reconcile and work for the common good of the party ahead of the 2022 general election. The call came from National Assembly's deputy Majority Chief Whip Cecily Mbarire, who at the same time announced she would vie for the Embu gubernatorial seat in 2022. Mbarire warned the women legislators that working at cross purposes might break the party as "when women take sides in a war things get worse". Women, the nominated MP said, are supposed to reconcile warring parties. She said the “handshake” between President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga should be appreciated because it had brought harmony in the country. Mbarire said Jubillee will win the 2022 elections if its leaders remain united. “Most women in Inua Mama and Embrace are from Jubilee and I think it’s time they came together, reconciled and brought all the warring leaders in the Jubilee house.” Inua Mama is in the Tangatanga faction allied to Deputy President William Ruto while Embrace backs the "handshake" of President Kenyatta and Raila. The nominated MP, who spoke during the handover ceremony of a Sh4 million ambulance bought by women in Kiambere Ward, said she belonged to none of the factions because, as Parliament's Majority deputy Chief Whip, she is supposed to be neutral. She was accompanied by Embu deputy Governor David Kariuki, county Health executive Joan Mwende, county Education executive John Kiamati, former Senate aspirant Munyi Mundigi and businessman Njagih Kithaka. Also present was Kiambere ward representative Lenny Mwaniki. Like Mbarire, Kariuki wants to succeed Martin Wambora as governor in 2022. The DG said the ongoing water projects for the semi-arid Mbeere region will be completed before the end of the year.
