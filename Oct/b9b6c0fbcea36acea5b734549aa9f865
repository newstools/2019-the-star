A Busia MCA has called for the installation of CCTV cameras and a fire alarm at the assembly building and Governor Sospeter Ojaamongâ€™s offices. Patrick Obongoya (nominated) told the Star at Budalangi on Sunday the alarm would help with quick response in cases of fires and the CCTV assist in investigations. He was reacting to Wednesday's early morning fire that burnt the Busia county finance office, destroying crucial documents in the department. The Busia county ODM chairman said a quick response would prevent loses of key documents to fire as happened at the finance offices. The MCA, however, called upon the residents not to panic over the incident. He said documents lost at offices are preserved digitally. He assured the residents that the implementation of projects will go on as planned as documents are also available at the relevant departments.
