Deputy President William Ruto has said that Kenyans determine the next step of the long-awaited Building Bridges Initiative report. Ruto said through his Twitter on Friday that every voice of a Kenyan must be heard without considering their status. "As a democratic society the proposals by BBI will be subjected to an open national conversation where every voice - the weak, strong, the small, big - will be heard," Ruto said. The DP has warned those yearning for bigger positions to be created for them from the BBI to be ready for a surprise. "Those working hard to create new fault lines, an us verses them 'clash' will fail so miserably they will be shocked!" Ruto added that politics of personalities that breeds negative ethnicity and division which poisons the nation are primitive and have no place in the current era. Earlier, Ruto had warned that any attempts to change the Constitution without involving the people would fail. Ruto said that it is high time politicians learnt from the Ekuru Aukot's Punguza Mizigo Bill that has received resistance in the majority of county assemblies. His comments elicited a backlash from politicians who are with proponents of BBI. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka said leaders should stop giving the impression that the BBI process will automatically result in a referendum. “Some people think that the BBI is there just to recommend a constitutional amendment. The BBI will just make a report and give it to President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. Thereafter, there will be public conversations about the report,” he explained. Kalonzo further stated that if there will be a need for a referendum, another team will pick up the matter adding Kenyans will be part of the discussions.
