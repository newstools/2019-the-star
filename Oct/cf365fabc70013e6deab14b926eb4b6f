Kirinyaga Woman Representative Wangui Ngirici has accused the government of neglecting tea and coffee farmers. She said tea farmers have been left at the mercy of brokers and the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA). Earlier this month, it was announced that farmers will take home an average Sh41.27 per kilogramme of green leaf in the 2018-19 bonus payment as earnings drop for the second year. Last year farmers took home an average Sh52.83. In 2017, farmers earned an average Sh58.76 per kilo, the highest in the last three years. Ngirici said it is regrettable that the government had decided to keep quiet when farmers are crying about low prices. The MP spoke in Gichugu constituency. "Farmers have been neglected and abandoned by our own government. We elected the Jubilee government because it promised to tackle our problems. We feel like we are not being taken seriously by the Uhuru Kenyatta-led government," Ngirici said. "Our government should stop burying its head in the sand and come up with a lasting solution to the problem." Meanwhile, Ngirici has said she will mobilise Kirinyaga County to reject BBI report if it introduces executive Prime Minister in the constitution. Mt Kenya leaders, she said, have pointed out that they will oppose the BBI report if it interferes with the sovereignty of Kenyans. She said Kenyans must elect their President through the ballot and no amount of intimidation or coercion will stop them from telling residents to reject the report. "Money should be allocated to counties and constituencies according to the population. Let nobody cheat you that we are going to accept BBI blindly," she said.
