 The government has placed 14 helicopters on standby to take exam papers to regions cut off by floods and those inaccessible by road. Water CS Simon Chelugui on Wednesday said the most affected regions include Turkana, Wajir, western and Marigat in Baringo. "Already, we have 14 helicopters to help us take the exams to those regions," Chelugui said. "We do not want a situation where a school has failed to sit on a particular exam because of floods." The CS spoke when he toured PCEA Musa Gitau Primary School in Kikuyu Subcounty to oversee the ongoing KCPE exam. He was accompanied by Kikuyu Water Company CEO Jane Murage, subcounty director of education Kamau Rwitha and Kiambu county education officer Victoria Mulili. The CS said the government had embarked on flood management measures. He said they had set aside Sh400 million for flood control to ease access to regions where floods wreak havoc.  edited by peter obuya
