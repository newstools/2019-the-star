Kenya Ferry Services has said the government has donated Sh200,000 to the family of the late Mariam Kighenda and daughter Amanda Mutheu for burial preparations. A cheque for Sh100,000 was issued to Kighenda's widower, John Wambua, and the other Sh100,000 is addressed to her father, Peter Mwaghogho. This comes after a multi-agency team retrieved the vehicle that had plunged into the Ocean-58 meters deep on Friday. Investigators said on Friday that they had a hard time separating the bodies of Mariam and her four-year-old daughter Amanda as they were found embraced in the back seat of their car. President Uhuru Kenyatta had assured Wambua, Mariam's widower, that the government will support Kighenda's family. The search came to an end after 13 days since the vehicle plunged into the ocean. the mission involved more than 80 divers drawn from both government and private firms. As Uhuru mourned the death of Mariam and Amanda, he assured Kenyans that efforts are being made to ensure that such an incident does not occur again in the future. He also hinted out that the proposed Likoni gate bridge and the ongoing construction of the Dongo Kundu by-pass will ease pressure on sea crossing between Mombasa Island and the South Coast.
