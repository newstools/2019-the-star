President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday launched the Nairobi Expressway, a first of its kind in Kenya. The project, to be implemented by Kenha, will be a four lane dual carriageway. The project connects the Nairobi-Mombasa section and the Nairobi-Malaba section. The expressway will have 10 interchanges, including the SGR terminus at JKIA, Eastern Bypass, Southern Bypass and Enterprise Road. Others are at Capital Centre, Haile Selassie Avenue, Thika Road, The Mall in Westlands, Sarit Centre and James Gichuru Road. The project, which will be financed through a Public Private Partnership, is expected to decongest the CBD. China Roads and Bridges Corporation (CRBC) will be the concessionaire.
