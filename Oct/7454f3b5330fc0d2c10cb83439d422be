Three people have denied vandalising guard rails along the recently upgraded Outer Ring Road. Simon Chege Warui, Peter Kamau Njeri and Jamleck Gikero Muihi were arrested last weekend, a Makadara court was told on Monday. Meanwhile, the Kenya Urban Roads Authority (Kura) has pledged a Sh100,000  reward to anyone with information on road vandals. Kura commended the public for informing on the suspects and the police for swiftly arresting them. Director-general Silas Kinoti warned that vandalism of road furniture was economic sabotage. “Vandalism of road furniture has become a major nightmare in the country and efforts must be made to ensure that the gains made are not watered down by selfish individuals who have no regards for public safety,” Kinoti said. The vandalism involves street lights, guard rails and road signs in most urban road networks. Over 30 street poles worth Sh5 million have been vandalised in Nairobi alone in the past three months, Kura said. The most affected roads are Thika Super Highway, Outer Ring Road, Ngong Road and Lang’ata Road. “We wish to condemn this barbaric behaviour which not only endangers the lives of road users but also renders the maintenance of roads expensive,” Kinoti said. The roads authority appealed to the public to name and shame vandals of public utilities. Kinoti said the government invests over Sh300 billion annually on roads and other infrastructures meant to drive Vision 2030 and regretted that some people were sabotaging the efforts. The public can use either telephone numbers 020-272222 and 0717105233 or email info@kura.go.ke to report vandalism. The same can be reported to the nearest police station.
