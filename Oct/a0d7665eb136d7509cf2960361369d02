 Investment in agri-technologies will ensure food security in the country, the traders' lobby said on Tuesday. The Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry said, through its president Richard Ngatia, that traditional agricultural methods are unsuitable to secure adequate food for a rapidly growing population. Ngatia spoke during the ongoing Nairobi International Trade Fair at Jamhuri showground. “The chamber will continue to assist the government achieve its food security agenda taking cognizance of the fact that traditional agricultural methods are not sustainable for a rapidly growing population,” he said.   "Biotechnology, photonics, big data and the Internet of Things (IoT) can be used to address the challenges in the agriculture sector and further nurture the next generation of farmers,” Ngatia said citing this year’s ASK Trade Fair theme of Promoting Innovation and Technology in Agriculture and Trade. He stressed key digital solutions in agribusiness, notably advisory and information for agricultural productivity to farmers, market linkages and farmers’ support in financial inclusion. To realise commercial investments in agriculture, Ngatia pledged to support farmers in capacity building, value addition and market linkages in the Great Lakes Region where he serves as the chairperson of the Great Lakes Region (GLR) Private Sector Forum bringing together 13 countries. “We have also committed to signing a memorandum of understanding with the Agricultural Society of Kenya that will enhance our partnership and cascade it down to the county level,” Ngatia said. He was accompanied during a tour of various stands by KNCCI's chief executive officer Angela Ndambuki and regional directors.  The 5,000 square-foot Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) exhibition centre was of particular interest to the group. The centre offers SMEs the platform to showcase and sell their products throughout the year.
