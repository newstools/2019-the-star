Gospel spin-master DJ Mo says one of his marriage mentors is Bishop Allan Kiuna. Talking about his marriage experience on Tuesday, he said the bishop told him that marriage is what you make it. "If you want it to work, it will work; if you donâ€™t want it to work it, will not work. In essence, you will get out of it what you put into your marriage." Mo and his celebrity wife Size 8 are blessed with a daughter, Ladasha Belle, and celebrated their sixth wedding anniversary late last month. He says he seeks advice from couples who have been in marriage for long. "It is always good to get lessons from the couples who have been there before. It is always about tolerating your partner. You know that there are things that someone can do that can really annoy you," he said. "Even if you married them for their beauty and looks, after some time, for you to maintain that marriage, one has to become a friend with their partner." Just like many married people, his advice is to always marry your friend. "It's simple, you have to marry your friend. You know in marriage after the first and second year, you outgrow things like physical attraction. You are left as friends. This is the person that you are with 24 hrs," he said.
