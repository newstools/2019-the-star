Kenyan teams are upbeat ahead of this afternoon’s semi-finals in the ongoing FIBA Africa Zone 5 women’s championship in Dar-es-salaam. Reigning champions Equity Bank face tricky Ugandan side JKL while Kenya Ports Authority confront Rwandese side, APR. Both teams remain unbeaten in the six-day tournament and are very much the sides to beat. The matches to be played at the national stadium will tip-off from 6 pm. Carey ‘T9’ Oketch will guide the bankers in the absence of coach David Maina, who returned home to attend the burial of his grandchild. “We play JKL of Uganda in the semis and I expect a tough match. We will prepare and plan accordingly,” said Oketch. National team star Betty Kananu, who was injured against APR is expected in action today. Kananu poured in a tournament-high of 28 points against Don Bosco and her performance will be key in today’s encounter. Equity Bank blanked APR 68-59 to head four-team Pool ‘B’. They also posted wins over Don Bosco of Tanzania and Les Gazelles of Burundi. Against APR, Shilalei Shani scored 12, Samba Mjomba and Annerose Mandela hit 11 each and Linda Alando added 10. KPA coach Mike Opel was worried about his offence and defence ahead of this make or break-tie, saying there was still work to be done. “We must be aggressive in our defence and rebounds,” he said, adding: “APR is a decent team and we must start well and pump in baskets.” KPA made it to the last four with a 68-47 victory over JKT of Tanzania. The porters led 37-22 at the break and went all the way to the final horn. Playing in Pool ‘A’ that had only three teams, KPA raced from behind to also squeeze a narrow 58-57 win over JKL. Equity Bank beat KPA in last year’s final at the same venue. The two are again favoured to battle it out for a ticket to the continental showcase.
