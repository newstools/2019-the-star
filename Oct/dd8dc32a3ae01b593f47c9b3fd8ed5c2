The Employment and Labour Relations Court has temporarily suspended the appointment of former Othaya MP Mary Wambui as Chairperson of the National Employment Authority. Justice Hellen Wasilwa ordered the suspension of the Gazette notice appointing Wambui pending hearing and determination of the petition. The petitioner, Kenya Young Parliamentarians Association, through their lawyers Mwenje & Karanja Co. Advocates, argued that Wambui is not qualified for appointment as Chairperson as per provisions of Section 10 (2) of the National Employment Authority Act. The said section is one of a mandatory nature and not discretionary to entitle the CS to derogate therefrom. "Wambui should not assume office as the Chairperson of the National Employment Authority, as she is a person not qualified under the law to be the Chairperson of the National Employment Authority" they argued. The Chairman of KYPA Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja instructed the KYPA lawyers to challenge the appointment of the former Othaya MP. The matter will be heard on 14th November 2019. Sakaja last Thursday opposed the appointment was unconstitutional and went against the vision of the institution. Section 10 (2) of the National Employment Authority Act states that a person shall be qualified to serve as the chairperson of the board if they have at least seven years experience in human resource management or its equivalent. "I have confidence that she has the ability to serve Kenyans in a different capacity but not as the vision carrier and chairperson of the NEA," Sakaja said.
