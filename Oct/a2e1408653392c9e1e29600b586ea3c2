Gor Mahia coach Steven Polack will once again be forced to travel with less than 15 players for the Caf Confederations Cup playoff return match against DC Motema Pembe in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo on Monday. Injuries and late registration of players have denied Polack the luxury of summoning his dreaded artillery among them is Ghanaian striker Francis Afriyie, Curtis Wekesa and Dennis Oalo. “I will work with the available players and seek to improve in all departments. The last two weeks have been slightly difficult but I laud the players for their desire and passion. The door is still open for us,” said Polack. The two teams drew 1-1 at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani over the weekend and despite the away goal Motema Pembe head coach Isaac Ngata believes the tie is far from over. A barren draw will be enough for the Congolese outfit needs to advance to the group stages of the tournament, a feat which attracts a Sh27 million cash award but Ngata expects Gor to give them a match. Motema Pembe rallied from a goal down to hold the home side who were reduced to ten men after Charles Momanyi was sent off, making him ineligible for the return match. Ngata, who lost his left-back, Ngimbi Mapangu to an ankle injury downplayed being at an advantage courtesy of the goal scored in Nairobi through William Luezi. “Even with the away goal, we are not better-placed to win as nothing is easy in modern-day football," said Ngata. "At home, we have to fight for a positive result which is not guaranteed. It's going to be a little bit difficult as one of us has to win the match.” Ngata at the same time rued a lapse in concentration by his rear men for the goal they conceded. Ivorian striker Gislein Yikpe netted Gor's goal in his first appearance in the continental tournament. “I was not impressed in the manner in which we conceded. We did not have enough concentration in defence but we will look to seal the loopholes before next week's match,” he observed.
