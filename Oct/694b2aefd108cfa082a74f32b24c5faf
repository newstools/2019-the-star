Nairobi Senetor Johnson Sakaja will file a petition seeking to cancel Mary Wambui's appointment as the chairperson of the National Employment Authority. Sakaja on Thursday said the appointment goes against Section 10(2) of the National Employment Authority Act as well as the vision of the institution. It states that that a person shall be qualified to serve as the chairperson of the board if they, have at least seven years experience in human resource management or its equivalent. "I have confidence that she has the ability to serve Kenyans in a different capacity but not as the vision carrier and chairperson of the NEA," Sakaja said. Sakaja said the National Employment Authorit's role is to solely focus on the unemployment state of Kenyan youths. The NEA was to establish job centres in all constituencies using the Huduma Centre model where unemployed youths would be able to go, register themselves with details of their qualifications and career aspirations, get soft skill training and have their details available nationally for both the public and private sector. Sakaja , in a statement, urged the government to take the institution seriously and see it as an opportunity to streamline access to the job market. "The leadership of such an institution would need a vision carrier with knowledge of the subject matter and with the passion to drive it, especially at its inception,"  Sakaja said. Wambui, lashed out at critics, saying she is deserving of the post and is up to the task. Sakaja said he has severally expressed frustration with the slow pace of implementation of the  institution and the seeming lack of goodwill to fully operate it.
