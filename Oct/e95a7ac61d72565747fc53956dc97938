South Africa's Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has fallen out of love with Twitter, saying he will no longer post "original tweets" because the social media site has become an "abusive platform". "I might, just might, retweet (not endorsement)," he added, in what could be last his original tweet: Mboweni did not say what had led him to take the decision now - which came hours before he delivers is mini-budget in parliament. There has been mixed reaction to his decision among Twitter users. Mboweni rarely tweeted, and was probably best-known for sharing with Twitter users his passion for food - especially canned pilchards - and he showed a good sense of humour. More recently, the minister has found some Twitter users poking fun at him following media reports about his private life.
