Bandari coach Bernard Mwalala remained cautious despite his team having booked a historic place in the last 32 of the Caf Confederation Cup following their 3-2 aggregate victory over Tunisian side US Ben Guerdane. Mwalala, who had to wait until the last minute when William Wadri scored the all-important away goal in their 2-1 second-leg loss on Sunday in Tunisia chastised his team for letting in early goals that nearly derailed their ambitions. "Our game plan was to keep it tight in defence and maybe score a goal but that did not materialise. "We conceded two early goals that left us vulnerable. "We had our chances and it was a typical game of two halves and we dominated the second half and eventually got the away goal we so badly needed. "But we are not losing focus. I  was not happy with the sloppy goals we conceded and at this level, you need to be switched on from the word go," he recounted. Bandari’s victory lends credence to their aspirations of becoming the top team in the country especially after Gor Mahia were eliminated for the Caf Champions League and will now join them in the next round of the Confederations Cup. “This is a big victory for Kenyan football, for Bandari as a club and Mombasa. We must not get carried away by this result but remain focused on the hard work ahead,” he concluded. Mwalala said his team had learnt a lot from their pre-season when they went to South Africa and will now await to see the team they are going to face in the next round and then plan against them.
