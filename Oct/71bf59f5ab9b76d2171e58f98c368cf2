Sports CS Amina Mohammed has dismissed claims that Kenyan women's netball team was stranded in South Africa. There were rumours on social media alleging that the team had been stranded after the government failed to cater to them. The team left the country on Thursday last week and will arrive tonight. But Amina said the story was a creation of social media which was blown out of proportion by the local media. Appearing before the National Assembly's Sports Committee on Thursday, the CS noted that the national team was taken good care of and urged Kenyans to shun media reports. "I can confirm that the team is not stranded. My witness is Senator Getrude (Getrude Musurive)," said Amina. "Anything in the mainstream media should not be considered as gospel truth," the CS added. MPs were however not convinced by Amina's explanation demanding that she makes a formal comprehensive report to the committee on the government's facilitation of the team. The CS asked the committee for an indoor meeting which was granted, kicking out the media from the coverage. The team was representing Kenya at the 2019 Africa Netball Championship in Cape Town. President Uhuru Kenyatta had earlier said that the government will support all the sportsmen and women in all disciplines as they represent the country abroad.
