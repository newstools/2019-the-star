A multi-agency team has seized 68 bales of bhang and Sh239,500 near Kanyonyoo Market along Garissa- Thika Highway. Two Police Constables, Japhet Fond, Bob Otieno and AP caommander Michael Mwangi were arrested on Wednesday and placed in custody. The team also impounded a government vehicle (Toyota Land Cruiser) which was being used to ferry the bales. Six bags of rice (300kg) labeled GoK, two bags of beans (100kg), six bags of sugar (25kg) each and contraband milk powder are among other foodstuff seized. In August, police in Kisumu seized a car-load of bhang with a street value of Sh3.4 million. The vehicle was being driven from South Nyanza towards Kisumu when police got a tip from the public and laid an ambush. According to police officers, the driver sensed danger and diverted at Rabour along the Kisumu-Nairobi highway. The ensuing chase ended at Manyatta Estate after the officers deflated the vehicle's tyres. Last month, the survey titled Holla released by Consumer Insight indicated that the use of bhang as a recreational drug among young people is gaining momentum.
