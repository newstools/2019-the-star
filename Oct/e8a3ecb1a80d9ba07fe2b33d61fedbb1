A woman yesterday denied assaulting police officer by biting her finger and splashing dirty water on her. Beatrice Natemi is said to have bitten police officer Maurine Kalumba's middle finger on October 6, at Industrial Area in Nairobi. The mother of seven also allegedly threw dirty water on her before hitting her face with a broom. Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga was told that Natemi was found in possession of 10 litres of chang'aa. The police officer was in patrol with her colleague when they heard some commotion and on checking saw some men watching football. They passed by the accused's house and found her sweeping away the dirty water.Â  She allegedly refused to let the officer pass and instead splashed the water on her uniform before hitting her with a broom. The accused is said to have grabbed the officer's hand and bit her middle finger before the complaint's colleague intervened. The officers searched her house and allegedly found 10 litres of chang'aa. She was freed on a Sh20,000 bail until February 19, 2020, when the case will be heard.
