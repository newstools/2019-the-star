Fifty-one residents of Kibra's Soweto east area have sued to stop their eviction from Kenya Railways houses. They say in suit papers they have lived there for more than 30 years and have long-term leases which should not be interfered with. "They have been residents of the said locus since the year 1981 and 1991 respectively and have entered into long-term lease agreement for a period of 45 years," the papers read. The 51 led by Charles Kamunya Mambo have sued the registered trustees of the Kenya Railways Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme, the Kenya Railways Corporation and the Ministry of Transport. The houses they reside in are managed by Kenya Railways Staff Retirement Benefit Scheme located 30 meters off the railway line. According to court papers, the residents pay Sh1,000 per year to the scheme for lease. Their trouble began in 2010 when the scheme together with the World Bank started enumeration of residents living along the railway line to re-organize the settlement and avoid encroachment. The arrangement was to be undertaken in tandem with the agreement between the scheme and residents requiring the latter to move out during the construction of the railway line and to be reallocated without violating their fundamental rights. They were then asked to fill forms indicating their next of kin with a requirement for balloting for the houses afresh. This method did not go well with the residents because they believed it was not effective. In their view the filing of forms was meant to overturn the original agreement which may lead to eviction from the premises.
