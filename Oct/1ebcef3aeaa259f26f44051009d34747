Kenyan Premier League CEO Jack Oguda insists reports off the rumour mills that the national championship might be cancelled are nothing but propaganda. Rumours has it that this season's fixtures will be called off due to the dire financial constraints that have crippled the body's ability to properly run the league. "The decision to stop the league can only be done by the Governing Council, who are representatives of the clubs in the KPL. So far, most have shown no such intention as they all want to see their respective clubs out there playing football," Oguda said. Clubs and the league itself have been enduring tough times monetary wise. The failure of former champions Sony Sugar to honour their home fixture against AFC Leopards was the latest signal that teams will struggle to fulfil their commitments. "It is sad that Sony did not honour their match. Their struggles can be traced to the well-documented allegations of sugar cartels importing sugar rendering sugar manufacturing companies, several of whom support football, insolvent. I think Sony is a victim of this and despite their request to have their game against AFC postponed, they were outside the set regulations and hence the walkover," Oguda explained. The KPL CEO urged clubs to toughen up as the league body continue their search for partners to bring money back to the game. "Some institutional clubs receive sponsorship but we have to ask ourselves if it is enough to sustain them through a season. As KPL we are out looking for naming rights to our league. We are also searching for a suitable broadcast for our league and if we are successful we will be able to support the clubs with grants and also pay referees" remarked Oguda. Oguda further challenged the government to speed up the renovation of key stadia, particularly Nyayo, to make the game accessible to more fans and improve match day revenue for clubs.
