For the longest time in the country, small scale mining business has not been given many platforms with the recent cry of miners in Migori pleading with the county and the national governments to ensure their safety. Local miners are not recognised despite playing a huge role in the countryâ€™s socio-economic development. Their safety is not guaranteed as they have been left to operate manually without safety and protective equipment. They should be provided with safety equipment as frequent exposure to the sites places their health at greater risk.  Mombasa
