Machakos county assembly on Wednesday joined other counties in the country in rejecting the Punguza Mizigo Bill. The motion was tabled before speaker Florence Mwangangi after the Members of the county assembly presented the bill to Machakos residents in a public participation in all eight sub counties of Machakos county. According to the speaker, the bill lacked clearance and so many things needed to be implemented before it was brought to the public. She said Aukot failed to involve Kenyans in a public participation to collect views on issues concerning them before it was taken to the county assemblies. Mrs Mwangangi said the bill is based on minimize the number of nominated members of the assembly adding that the MCAs felt that it was targeting women. Another reason was that people living with disabilities together with the youths were left out in the bill. According to the speaker, Machakos residents disagreed with the idea of reducing the number of MPs to two, arguing that their needs will not be adequately represented by only two leaders who will be over tasked. However, the speaker refuted claims by one of the dailies that MCAs have been receiving Sh. 700,000 each per month. She said MCAs receive a salary of Sh. 312,000 which includes all the monthly allowances. "I want to say that those claims that we MCAs receive Sh. 700,000 is ridiculous since that amount exceeds our monthly salary so its not true and this can cause conflicts between our members and the wananchi," she said. She urged MCAs to ignore Ekuru Aukot's statement that they were bribed to reject the bill adding that the Machakos county assembly in particular rejected the bill since it had nothing good that could benefit the members of the public.
