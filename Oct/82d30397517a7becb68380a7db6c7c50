 Moi Teaching Referral Hospital, Eldoret, will treat the seven-year-old Turkana boy with cancer at no cost to the family. The plight of Stephen Lowesit, a Std One pupil at Kanaodon Primary School, was highlighted by the Star two days ago. His widowed mother, Alice Tukwali, had the previous day appealed for help from Lodwar County Referral Hospital, where she had taken him for treatment. Lowesit has a cancerous lump below his left ear. He had been misdiagnosed as a tuberculosis patient at a medical camp run by a team of Spanish doctors several months ago. The boy took the TB drugs for six months between February and August without his condition improving. It was at LCRH that Rogers Gonzalez, a Cuban doctor, found that Lowesit was not suffering from TB. A September 28th report by Dr K. Ketitany, a consultant pathologist at MTRH, showed that the boy has cancer and not TB for which he was being treated. Simon Loyore, a senior health administrative officer at LCRH, said they have managed to trace the boy and he will be taken at MTRH. Loyore said that after the Star story, MTRH chief executive Wilson Aruasa announced that the boy would be treated at no cost to the mother. “We have been collaborating with medical officers and Cuban doctors to see how best the boy can be treated but it happened the mother of the child had other children at home in the village to attend to. "Our team has managed to trace the boy and soon he will be airlifted to MTRH for advanced medicare through the support of MTRH,” he said.
