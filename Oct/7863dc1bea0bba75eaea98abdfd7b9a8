The Kwale county executive for culture and social services Ramadhan Bungale has dismissed allegations that county stadiums have turned into dens for teen pregnancies. Some local politicians have mocked stalled county government projects which are said to have cost taxpayers but brought disasters rather than development. Bungale said the county’s idea of constructing the stadiums remains noble as its goal is to transform youths through sports. He said inappropriate use of the fields is not one of the county's objectives. Bungale said the county aims at nurturing talents to help fight unemployment in the region. “Let me be clear. One cannot associate their bad character with county development. These are two different things,” he said. The minister said cases of early pregnancy were there even before the playgrounds were constructed. “It is ironic that people use stadiums as an excuse. From what I know, these cases have been here for long,” said Bungale. He said the blame should be directed to parents for failing in their responsibilities. Bungale said construction of the stadiums will soon be completed. “I heard some individuals complaining about these fields but for a fact, they will be ready before this year ends and play the roles they were intended for,” Bungale said. Bungale spoke on Monday at Libra grounds  in Matuga during county ball games.
