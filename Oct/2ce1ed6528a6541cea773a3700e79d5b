Wajir Woman Representative Fatuma Gedi  on Friday accompanied ODM aspirant in the Kibra by-election, Imran Okoth, during his campaigns in Lindi ward. She faulted Jubilee party for picking McDonald Mariga for the race, saying he was bad a choice. Appearing in a JKL interview last week, Fatuma said Jubilee did not practice democracy while picking its candidate compared to ODM. "The Jubilee nominations were not democratic at all. We wanted a free and fair process. They should have allowed people to vote. ODM was more democratic," Fatuma Gedi said in an interview with JKL. Gedi is a member of PDR party, which is affiliated to Jubilee. Campaigns in Kibra have gained momentum as 24 cleared aspirants seek to replace the late area MP Ken Okoth. Imran was accompanied by MPs Ahmed Ibrahim (Wajir North), Abdikarim Osman(Fafi),  Senator Abshiro Halake and Anthony Oluoch of  Mathare. On Wednesday, ODM leaders held a meeting with IEBC officials at Anniversary Towers over the voter register. The ODM team demanded that the commission should provide them with a  register of all voters in Kibra. ODM leaders who met with commissioners included party chairman John Mbadi, secretary general Edwin Sifuna, Florence Mutua (Busia woman representative), MPs Babu Owino (Embakasi East), TJ Kajwang' (Ruaraka) and Executive Director Oduor Ong'wen. Chebukati said it would provide the register to ODM.
