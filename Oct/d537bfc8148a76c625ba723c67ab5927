President Uhuru Kenyatta has revoked the appointment of Kenya Ferry Services board members. In a special Gazette notice dated October 16, Uhuru fired chairman Dan Mwazo and members Daula Omar, Naima Amir, Philip Ndolo and Rosina Mruttu. The revocation takes effect immediately. This comes after the September 29 Likoni Ferry tragedy in which a mother - Mariam Kighenda - and her four-year-old daughter - Amanda -died after their car slipped off the MV Harambee ferry and sunk in the Indian Ocean. Kenya Ferry Services on Tuesday issued two cheques worth Sh100,000 each to widower John Wambua and the late Kighendaâ€™s father, Peter Mwaghogho Mwanyasi. The token elicited sharp reactions from Kenyans who took to social media to criticise the parastatal. Their bodies were retrieved last Friday, 12 days after their car slipped into the ocean. Directorate of Criminal Investigations detectives on Sunday begun investigations into what caused the tragedy.
