The outage spurred #TwitterDown as a trending hash tag in the U.S. "You might have had trouble Tweeting, getting notifications, or viewing DMs. We're currently working on a fix, and should be back to normal soon", the company said in a tweet about 7 hours ago, which did not give further details.

The company in July was hit by a similar outage due to an internal system change for more than an hour, affecting nearly 70,000 people globally according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com. Twitter's shares were down nearly 1% at $39.80 in trading before the bell.
