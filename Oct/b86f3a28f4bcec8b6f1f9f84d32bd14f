FC Talanta head coach Abdallah Juma can afford a sigh of relief after his players assured him of resuming work against Mt Kenya United on Monday. The club's technical bench had to rely on eleven players in their last match away to Fortune Sacco in Kirinyaga on Wednesday after a handful of them had downed their tools citing lack of pay. However, motivation was yesterday injected into the playing unit as the Communications Authority Board chairman, Ngene Gituku honoured his pledge of donating Sh200, 000 to the team. Gituku had committed to rewarding the playing unit following their exploits in the past edition of the Kecoso games held at Gusii Stadium in August where they finished second. Against Fortune Sacco, Juma revealed that he had to deploy his first-choice goalkeeper Joel Bataro as the lead striker. The former Chemelil Sugar coach reckoned that the financial boost will inspire them to bounce back to their winning ways when they tackle the former top-flight side.  Talanta sit ninth with 14 points. “We have been doing badly financially but I now expect the boys to turn up in good number when we play United on Monday. The token came at a time the boys needed it and we are keen to repay the boost with a win. In our last match, I had eleven players but the boys have promised to avail themselves. I am glad we managed to pick a point in Kirinyaga despite having no substitutes on the bench. I used my first-choice goalkeeper as the main striker .” The club captain Patrick Muchiri said the reward would trigger positive performance to motivate them to finish within the automatic promotion bracket. The St. Anthony's Boys alumnus challenged his teammates to put their best feet forward and break their seven-year quest to promotion jinx.
