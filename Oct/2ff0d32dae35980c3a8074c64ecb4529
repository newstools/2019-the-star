Three men suspected of stealing Sh970,000 from an Equity Bank account belonging Faith Wanjiku, 73, have denied the charges. Anthony Kaiba, Kelvin Maina and Joseph Kariuki were charged with conspiring to steal before Thika Resident magistrate Anne Maina on Wednesday. The charge sheet says that on July 16, 2019, together with others not before the court, they conspired to steal from Equity Bank Thika branch in the same town. The first and second accused persons were also charged that on the same date with others not before the court they stole Sh970,000 from Wanjiku's Equity Bank account. The prosecution led by state counsel Wamuyu Nguai successfully applied for three days to hold the accused persons to complete investigations. She said more suspects linked with the case are expected to be apprehended. Justice Maina ordered the three be held at Thika police station. The case will be mentioned on October 7. The three were arrested in Thika Tuesday by detectives based at Thika West police station according to a tweet by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI). The DCI said that the money from Wanjiku's account was transacted in four series using the Equity Bank’s Eazzy App. Antony Kaiba, Kelvin Maina and Vivian Jelagat received Sh300,030 each. The remainder was transferred to various Equitel mobile numbers. The stolen money was part of the payment the woman received after selling her parcel of land. Relatives and friends had planned a demonstration in Thika town on Thursday to agitate for justice for her. Through their lawyers Muiruri, Cheserek & Co Advocates, they wrote to Thika OCS requesting permission to picket for Wanjiku’s cause. The request was denied and the group told to allow the investigative agencies to complete their work and bring to book those behind the crime.
