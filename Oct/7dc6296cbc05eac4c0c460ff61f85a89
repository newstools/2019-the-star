County governments should consider erecting mobile toilets in lane roads of major towns that fall under their areas of jurisdiction. Most lane roads in many towns are dirty and insecure at any time of the day. These lane roads are ‘toilets’ to many and it will not be a wonder to find heaps of human faeces scattered all over with the pungent smell of urine taking over the whole lane. One may mistake them for a faulty sewer line. Beside erecting toilets, security should be beefed up in these lanes that act as hideouts for criminals who mug innocent civilians.  Nairobi
