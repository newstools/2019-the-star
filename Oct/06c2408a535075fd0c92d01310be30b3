A five-day referees’ assessors course in Machakos ended over the weekend. The course which brought together 29 retired referees, most of whom are actively serving as Match Commissioners was aimed at bridging the gap in referees’ management and supervision. It marked Football Kenya Federation’s second program for match officials this month. “We conducted a FIFA MA Referees course for Kenyan Premier League referees, and have followed it up with training for match commissioners,” said FKF Deputy President Doris Petra at the closing ceremony of the event. “As a Federation, capacity building of our match officials remains a key pillar in our football development agenda. It is for this reason that we have continuously held quarterly referees’ training and Physical Endurance Tests(PET's),” she added. The trainees were drawn from FKF Branches across the country and were under the tutelage of former Zimbabwean referee Felix Tangawarima, who is a member of the CAF Referees Committee and is also in charge of referees on the continent’s English speaking Member Associations. Earlier last week, 35 Kenyan Premier League referees, some drawn from the FIFA Panel, went through a FIFA Member Association referees course and were duly certified.
