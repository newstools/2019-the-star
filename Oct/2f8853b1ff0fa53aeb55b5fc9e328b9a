 A Budalang'i family whose house was gutted by fire has appealed to area MP Raphael Wanjala to help them build a new one. Lillian Kajaju's house was burnt two years ago in Sisenye of Choyi village in Bunyala North. The mother of two says she has been living with the family in a makeshift shanty since the incident of November 2017. Kajaju on Sunday told the Star her husband has not been able to construct a new house. He is a fisherman. "Lack of resources forced us to put up a shanty using the leaking iron sheets that were destroyed by the fire. We appeal to our MP Wanjala to come to our rescue and save us from the rains," Kajaju said.  edited by peter obuya
