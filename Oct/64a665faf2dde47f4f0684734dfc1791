Deputy President William Ruto has said there will be no automatic candidates for any seat in Jubilee Party in 2022. Ruto said the party was founded on democracy and, therefore, candidates running for various seats would be subjected to free and fair nominations. The DP spoke on Thursday at the home of former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale in Malinya, Kakamega County. He said it is the responsibility of voters to elect leaders without interference. The Deputy President had visited the home of Khalwale to console him and the family following the death of his first wife, Adelaide. He was accompanied by MPs Bernard Shinali (Ikolomani) and Benjamin Washiali (Mumias East). "We embrace democracy and respect the will of the people. We will all compete for different positions in the nominations. There will be no direct ticket in Jubilee Party in all the seats,” Ruto said. The Deputy President said it is through competition that the best men and women are always elected in a democratic society. “As a democratic party, we are open and transparent in the way we carry out our activities,” he said. The Deputy President, at the same time, said the party would next year hold grassroots elections. “We are going to have grassroots elections next year to have men and women competent to manage the affairs of our party,” Ruto said. The DP has been on record saying that he is ready to retire and go home with President Uhuru Kenyatta should he lose the polls in 2022. Ruto said in 2022, the Jubilee Party members will sit down as a party and decide on a flag bearer for the presidency as well as the other elective seats. "If I will not be the flag bearer, I will support the person who the Jubilee Party members choose as their presidential candidate. It is not a must I be the candidate," Ruto said.
