Elite and untested athletes will be competing at the inaugural Bishop Cornelius Korir Memorial Cross country championships set for November 2nd at The Eldoret Sports Club. The late Korir, the Bishop for Eldoret Catholic Dioceses died on October 30, 2017 and catholic officials will be marking his second anniversary with the cross country as part of honouring the man who was described as a peacemaker in the volatile North Rift and Kenya as a whole. Speaking during the launch yesterday, Father William Kosgei, the Vicar General said honouring the bishop through the cross country will be good for the region as well as the nation. He said that honouring talents in the region, which boasts of producing world-beaters in athletics will be a good thing as young talents will be nurtured for the future. “As a nation, we have a glut of talents especially in this region and we want to celebrate together, have a collective mass and worship together,” said Kosgei. A variety of athletes is expected from elites to the primary going school kids where they will be battling for various prizes. "We will have all categories including for both boys and girls in upper primary (between 12-15 years), junior secondary school boys and girls, elite men and women as well as a parish team,” added Kosgei. The elite men and women athletes will be competing in 10km where top six finishers will be feted. The vicar added that registration is already ongoing. “Bishop Korir’s mission was to preach peace and as bishops, we are doing it in various ways, where the cross country is part of preaching peace in the country,” concluded Kosgei.
