Students at Masinde Muliro University have threatened to sue Education CS George Magoha over instability in the institution's leadership. The institution was shut down two weeks ago by the university senate following students unrest. The learners were protesting against a decision by management that all students must clear fee balances before registering for courses and sitting examinations. The students also accused the administration of not investigating recent cases where at least eight students have lost their lives since January. Other issues the learners want addressed include rampant cases of missing marks, harassment of students by finance staff and lack of internet services. Student leader Vincent Lumala said the institution continue to face leadership challenges because all top officials are serving in acting capacity. He said the student body wants Magoha to address the leadership within 48 hours failing which they will sue him. Lumala wondered why the university management had been left in the hands of acting officials at the expense of proper administration and efficient running. The Public Service Commission already interviewed candidates for the position of vice chancellor which has remained vacant for close to a year now. Asenath Sigot is current acting VC. She was appointed for three month as PSC completes the process of recruiting a substantive official.
