Kitui county assembly is this week likely to invoke its powers to sack two executive members they had requested Governor Charity Ngilu to fire in August. Majority leader Peter Kilonzo on Tuesday tabled two notices of motion for the assembly to sack Health executive Rosaita Ngina and her Trade counterpart Philip Mumo should Ngilu fail to fire them in three days. Kilonzo said his notice of motion was prompted by the governor's failure to implement the assembly resolution to sack the executives over claims they forged degree certificates to be hired. He was addressing a session presided over by Speaker George Ndotto. He accused the duo of not only breaching the Constitution on integrity but also being incompetent "considering they did not possess the requisite qualification to hold the positions they were appointed to". In early August, the assembly unanimously endorsed a report by the Appointment committee and gave Ngilu a seven-day ultimatum to sack Mumo and Ngina. “The degree certificates for the two county executive committee members were confirmed as forged and they did not emanate from the institutions that purportedly issued them,” the committee said in its report. Then, the assembly resolved to impeach the duo in case Ngilu fails to sack them after the lapse of the seven days. They also want the DPP to prosecute the two and the Asset Recovery Agency to recover what they have illegally earned. Kilonzo said although Mumo has executed the duties of his office at the county headquarters, Ngina's job status remains hazy as she has not been operating from her office at the Kitui County Referral Hospital since early last year. Her administration colleague, Benard Katungi, has been holding brief for her at the health and sanitation department. Edited by R.Wamochie
