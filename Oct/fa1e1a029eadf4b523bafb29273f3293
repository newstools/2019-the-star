Kenyan pupils in London were thrilled to meet their the world's best teacher Peter Tabichi who won the Global Teacher Award 2019. Tabichi last Friday visited Nelson Primary School in East London in a tour organised by Kenyan Daniel Okiya, who teaches at the same school. “I’m happy to see that we managed to attract our biggest sponsors and more. The British Council and DFID (Department for International Development) and Kenya High Commission in the UK are here. I'm happy to see what the Kenyan -UK partnership in education does," Okiya said. Tabichi was taken around the school and answered questions fielded by the pupils. The pupils wanted to know Tabichi's plans with the Sh100 million he won after clinching the global prize while others wanted to know the secret behind his success. The curious pupils wondered how he could teach ICT yet there was insufficient electricity supply in his school. Tabichi said he is going to use the money to make a difference. He shared his passion to support STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Maths) projects in Kenya, Africa and elsewhere with an aim to get more experts whowill make a difference in the world. “It makes feel great here interacting with teachers and children. I can see how they have great teaching facilities," he said. "I’m learning a lot from what they do and comparing with Kenya and when I go back, I will share with my fellow teachers and students. I thought that people in London didn’t know much about Kenya, and I was so happy to see them singing both British and Kenya National anthem.” He said he involves the children he teaches by letting them own the lessons. "It’s simply student-centred teaching. I engage them and make lessons exciting, integrating ICT. I know your teachers do the same here,” Tabichi said.
