My life is in danger! These were the words of Majority Leader of the Nairobi County Assembly, Abdi Guyo. Guyo, who recorded a statement at the DCI headquarters on Monday, told journalists that he feared for his life. This was after chaos that transpired at the county assembly last week following the unexpected return of embattled Nairobi Speaker Beatrice Elachi. Broken chairs and tables, flower vase falling down and tear gas swept the room at the assembly last week. Addressing the media, Elachi said that women in the county assembly are tired of intimidation. But addressing the media, Guyo claimed that the fracas was well organised and that the goons had been mobilised to storm the assembly. "If you look at the videos recorded last week, you will clearly see the same goons who beat up Timothy Muriuki are the same people who were chanting Guyo must go, so what does that tell you? ”Guyo posed. Since the fracas last week, Guyo said he has received numerous text messages threatening his life. The Majority Leader also claims that unknown people have been trailing him and monitoring his moves. He played an audio recording, allegedly of a conversation between Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and EALA MP Simon Mbugua, where the MP is heard saying he has instructed a man by the name Yego to track Guyo’s car. These claims have not been substantiated.
