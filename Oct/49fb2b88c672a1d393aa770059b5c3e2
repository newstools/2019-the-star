Base Titanium is expected pay Sh270 million to compensate Nguluku residents in Kwale county. Issuing compensation cheques to 52 families, at Msambweni subcounty, Base Titanium liaison manager Pius Kasim said they have started paying Sh250,000 per acre. Sh100,000 will be for disturbance and the company will add Sh500,000 for the land, he said. "We have decided to give that amount after determining the value of acreage so that they can quickly relocate to other areas and establish new settlements,” Kasm said. He said residents are being compensated although they were living on land initially leased toKwale International Sugar Company (KISCOL). "We have treated them like they own the lands and pay equally even though they are squatters," he said. Kasim said so far, more than 300 people have submitted title deeds, looking forward to further company exploration. Representing the Nguluku residents, William Maponda said he is satisfied with the compensation terms. He said the firm has been fair and respected residents. Maponda said the company has raised their standards of living from squatters to landowners and they will be forever grateful. Kassim said the Australian company is relocating residents to safeguard them from potential health threats since they have moved closer. Base Titanium has shifted to the southern dune part of Nguluku in the second phase of their mining contract after exhausting sand mineral resources at Maumba. Kasim said the entire process of compensation is voluntary. "The locals come here willingly to sign for the cheques and nobody is behind their decision making or pressurising them," said Kasim. He said the company ought to carry out exploration at Ramisi, Darugube, Mchinjirini and Fahamuni areas, only at the residents'  request. Early this year, Base Titanium encountered community resistance as t sought t prolong the Kwale mining life. (Edited by V. Graham)
