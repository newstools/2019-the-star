The country decided no national day should be named after an individual. It even put it on paper and ink in the Kenyan Constitution. We even went ahead and scrapped Kenyatta Day instantly and renamed it Mashujaa Day in the inclusion of all Kenyan heroes and heroines. Yet, Moi Day is still celebrated. If this continues to be the case, Kenyatta day and Kibaki day should come in, in remembrance of all former Kenyan presidents. The criteria used to mark Moi Day as a public day is questionable. If we designated other days to the other former presidents, Kenyans would understand why we still mark Moi Day. Otherwise, we are just implementing rules and laws selectively, which tells a lot about how we manage every other regulation including those on corruption.  Mombasa
