 Extra-judicial killings in Mathare are a worrying concern. The targets are mainly males in the 18-24 age category, according to human rights activists. They spoke on Sunday at Mathare Social Justice Centre as they honoured Prof Yash Pal Ghai for his work in championing social justice. Many cases are not reported, Mathare rights activist Geceke Gachehe said, noting that there had been more than five killings in the informal settlement in the past two weeks. “Police kill innocent people and they do not see it as a big deal because they are used to it," Gachehe said. A 2018 Independent Medico Legal Unit report identified Nairobi police as the worst offenders. There are 16 social justice centres in Nairobi. Two others, one in Kibera and the other in Dagoretti will be opened soon. Ghai accused the government of failing to observe the Constitution. “Human rights defenders have not yet received much recognition and resources from the government. Every article in the human rights chapter has been ignored.” He continued, "The Constitution belongs to the people. But it is like it is just for the rich people who do not care about other people at all. That is not the way we designed the Constitution." The constitutional expert regretted that the number of people living below the poverty life is increasing. "There is too much poverty now. How can it be? It is increasing while there is still a lot of resources and potential," he stated.
