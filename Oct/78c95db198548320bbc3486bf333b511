Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji on Wednesday ordered police to rearrest a trader who allegedly defiled and impregnated a Standard 5 pupil. He also directed that the man should not be released on bail. “You must object to bail when the man is taken to court. We need stringent legal measures taken against people accused of sexual offences,” Haji said. He was in Homa Bay to listen to residents' concerns and complaints. One of the complaints was that of the alleged defiler who is on the loose. The DPP said the fight against defilement should not be taken lightly. “Defilement and sexual offences cannot be tolerated. I want that man to be arrested as soon as today,” Haji said. The 40-year-old man is accused of defiling the 13-year-old girl in a Homa Bay town estate. It is not clear when she was defiled. The minor is reported to have dropped out of school due to the pregnancy. Residents who know the pupil said she feared being humiliated by her colleagues. Homa Bay OCPD Sammy Kosgei on Thursday confirmed that the suspect was arrested on July 26 and taken to Homa Bay police station. He was released on a police bond of Sh10,000 the following day (July 27). The suspect was supposed to appear in court on Monday, July 29, but he skipped court. The suspect is reported to have disappeared from Homa Bay town, where he used to operate a retail shop. Some Homa Bay residents on Wednesday raised the matter with Haji when he visited the county. They complained that the girl and her family did not get justice despite the arrest of the suspect. “We realised the suspect left police cells without proper reasons. There is a need for the minor and entire family to get justice,” a resident appealed to the DPP. On Thursday, Homa Bay county police commander Esther Seroney said they were looking for the suspect. “Our officers are already on the ground to ensure the man is brought to book,” Seroney said.
