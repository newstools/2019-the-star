An inmate in Embu died after a prison pick-up rolled several times on the Embu-Chuka road on Tuesday morning. Eight other inmates and seven warders were injured in the 6.30am accident. They were being ferried from Embu to the courts in Chuka. Tharaka Nithi fire brigade and rescue team leader Alex Mugambi said the driver lost control of the vehicle in Kathageri near Thuci lodge. The vehicle rolled several times. Mugambi said the injured were rushed to Chuka Level 4 Hospital. He said several of them required surgery. Resident Maureen Mwende said she heard a loud bang and when she went to the scene of the accident, she found the victims writhing in pain. Nicasio Njoka said he was asleep when he heard a loud bang but could not rush to the scene because he has a broken leg. He later went to the scene. Residents said the area is a black spot and that there are no road signs. They praised the Tharaka Nithi rescue team for the quick response. The vehicle involved in the accident was towed to the Runyenjes police station.
