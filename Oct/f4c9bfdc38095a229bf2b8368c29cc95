A family at Kibundani village in Msambweni are searching for their son who went missing three weeks ago. Juma Sarai was abducted on October 4 by unknown people, according to the family. They have reported the matter to Diani Police Station. Sarai's friend Mohammed Hassan said three men drove by a petrol station at Ukunda and bundled him into a car then sped off. “A vehicle braked suddenly by a fuel station then heavy built men fetched Sarai, threw him in and drove away,” he said. Hassan said locals thought they were policemen in civilian attire and decided to trace him in all police stations to no avail. Sarai’s wife, Biasha Tsuma said she was doing house chores when she was informed that her husband had been arrested. “Sarai was relaxing at the verandah after tea, so I got busy with home activities. Some minutes later a neighbour came panting and shouting that my husband had been taken by police officers,” she said. Tsuma pleaded with security authorities to give any information about where his husband might have gone. “This looks like kidnap and if police have any clue let them tell us. We only want to know where he is,” Tsuma said. According to Haki Africa statistics, 18 cases of forced disappearances have been reported in Kwale. Police have launched investigations into Sarai's alleged kidnapping.
