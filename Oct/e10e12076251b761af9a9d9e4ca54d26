The Kenya Urban Roads Authority will source funds from the Export-Import Bank of Korea to finance the Outer Ring Road section of Nairobi's Bus Rapid Transport. “The route will require BRT but the available resources are inadequate,” Kura director-general Silas Kinoti said on Thursday. Kinoti said the BRT was not part of the original design. He disclosed that the dualling of Outer Ring Road is now 90 per cent complete. Four footbridges are already in use and three more will be opened to the public by November 10. The 13km carriageway was officially opened on July 28, 2017. It runs from where demolished Taj Mall stood on North Airport Road to GSU headquarters in Ruaraka. Overall, the road will have a total of 11 footbridges. The project includes the construction of Wakulima Fresh Produce Market which is 99 per cent complete, only awaiting water and power connections. Kariobangi Market is also a beneficiary of the project. The Taj Mall link to the carriageway will be ready for vehicular traffic next month, Kinoti said. "This, added to the improved junction at Ruaraka and traffic discipline, will ensure maximum road efficiency,” he said. The new Outer Ring Road is intended to ease traffic flow in Eastlands. It is also part of the greater Nairobi traffic decongestion plan. President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the dualling of the project on January 22, 2015. Kura says the road has transformed Eastlands, where a big proportion of Nairobi residents lives. The project contractor is SinoHydro Tianjin Engineering Company Ltd. It is financed by the African Development Bank and the national government. Over 1,099 people were engaged four years ago. ‘The project has seen over 400 youths who used to hawk along the corridor trained to acquire life skills in various institutions,” Kinoti said.
