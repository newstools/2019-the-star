A multi-agency team In Kisauni, Mombasa has seized more than 25,200 rolls of bhang estimated to be worth more than Sh12 million. The rolls were found in a residence in Kiembeni Estate on Friday. One suspect, Vivian Auma, the owner of the house, was arrested and is in police custody. During the search, the team found 42 large Nigerian bags in one of the rooms with rolls of bhang which were wrapped in brown khaki papers. The team was acting on a tip-off from members of the public. Investigations are ongoing and suspects will be arraigned on Monday. Kisauni Sub County Police Commander Josephat Kiragu termed Ouma, 25, as a notorious bhang peddler who have escaped arrests severally. “We will always thank members of the public. We raided the estate after a tip off and found the consignment in the house,” Kiragu said. The suspect lived in a two-bedroomed house and had converted one of the bedrooms to be a bhang store where 42 bags with the rolls were hidden. “We are looking for her mother Lillian Ouma who they do the business with,” he said.
