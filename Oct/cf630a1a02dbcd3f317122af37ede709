It was their second defeat of the campaign and left them down in eleventh place with four points from as many games. “Tusker is a very good and experienced team and it was not easy for us. We wanted to continue with the winning run to maintain ourselves in the top five but it was not to be now we can only look forward to the next game,” he said.on the clubs official portal. The forward added: “As a team, we have gelled now because many of us were new and now, we have a more solid unit. It will be hard to break us down.” Sofapaka are back in action on Sunday when they take on CAF Confederation Cup revelations Bandari.
