Two motorcycle operators were hit and killed by motorists over the weekend. In the first incident, a man was killed by a motorist along Naivasha-Mai Mahiu Road near the Moi South Lake junction. The driver, who sped away from the scene, hit the operator from behind. The rider was pronounced dead on arrival at Naivasha Subcounty Hospital. A witness, Joel Kobia, said the driver of the private car sped towards Mai Mahiu. “The driver lost control of the car which veered off the road and hit the motorcycle operator launching him metres away,” he said. In the second incident, another operator was hit and killed by a vehicle near Kinungi trading centre along the Nairobi-Nakuru Highway. “The motorcyclist joined the highway without checking oncoming vehicles leading to the accident,” a witness said. According to James Kabono from Naivasha Safety Group, the number of accidents involving motorcycle operators is on the rise. Kabono said that the sector was losing at least two operators every month and called for refresher courses to address the rising number of deaths. “We have recorded four fatal accidents near the scene in the last five months and its time we held a meeting with the operators,” he said. He blamed drunk driving, lack of driving licenses and insurance as some of the challenges facing youths working in the sector. “In some of the accidents, the operators were not licensed to be on the road while the motorcycles were not insured further complicating the situation,” he said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said that the two bodies had been collected and taken to Naivasha mortuary. Edited by R.Wamochie
