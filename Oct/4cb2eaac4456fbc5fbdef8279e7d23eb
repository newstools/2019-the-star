A man died on Saturday after a trailer he was driving plunged into River Arujo in Homa Bay town. Samuel Muira lost control on a bridge on the Homa Bay-Rongo road. He was ferrying cane to Sukari Industry factory in Ndhiwa. Homa Bay county police commander Esther Seroney said the lorry's brake failed before it hit a rail guard and fell into the river. She said the driver was trying to avoid an oncoming Probox car. Muira was alone in the vehicle. He suffered serious head injuries and was rushed to Homa Bay County Referral Hospital where he died. â€œThe driver got stuck inside the wreckage. Residents, with the help of police officers, removed and took him to the hospital," Seroney said. The wreckage was towed to Homa Bay police station and the body preserved at the hospital's morgue.
