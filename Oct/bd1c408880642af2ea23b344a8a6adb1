Tanzania could soon get its own musician-turned-MP. But unlike Uganda's Bobi Wine,Tanzania's Harmonize backs the government. President John Magufuli has just endorsed the musician, whose real name is Rajab Abdul, for a run at a seat in parliament next year. The president's support comes as his government continues to ban songs deemed sexually suggestive by some other artists. Mr Magufuli's blessing came after Harmonize entertained him at a rally, the Swahili newspaper Mwananchi reports. Harmonize's songs have been spared in the government's moralistic campaign, though his contemporaries Diamond Platnumz and Rayvanny, have been repeatedly summoned by police and at one time banned from performing their "indecent" songs in public. Harmonize recently released a praise song for President Magufuli, describing him as a hardworking leader with a rich development record.
