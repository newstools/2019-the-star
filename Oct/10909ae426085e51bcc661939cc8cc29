The government is working on a strategy with Farmers Choice to improve pig farming in the country. Trade CS Peter Munya and Kiambu deputy governor James Nyoro said they are working with the company to boost its production capacity. The leaders urged farmers to start practising pig farming, as plans to start buying pigs from them was a priority. "Among the issues we are looking at are marketing. If the firm can buy the pig from locals, they can boost their production," Nyoro said. Farmers Choice managing director James Taylor said they slaughter between 400 and 420 pigs a day, but on holidays about 500. He said their meat, bacon and other products are sold locally and others exported. He said if the production can be improved, there was market outside the country, adding that the company was ready to offer technical advice to local pig farming farmers. "We have a technical team which advises and supervises local pig farming. We ensure they have grown well, kept well and of better quality" Taylor said. Munya had toured the plant on Friday and was accompanied by Nyoro. They were welcomed by Taylor and the general manager Sharon Tsogandi. The CS said since the company was now running privately, the government was laying a strategy with its management to increase production. "We want the company and locals to benefit. This can only be done when locals are involved. The company must produce enough for the country and increase for export" he said. Munya told farmers to take the advantage of pig farming since it requires a small portion of land to practice. He added that they mature at eight months and their gestation period is 114 days. "This is the most economical farming one can practice. It does not require huge tracks of land, and they grow very fast," he said. The company, formerly Uplands Bacon Factory, was opened in 1906 and was granted 248 acres of land for a bacon-curing industry.
