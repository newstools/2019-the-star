A lobby group wants Chief Justice David Maraga to help speed up land dispute cases. The Capital Youth Caucus Association said on Wednesday the longer land cases are delayed in courts, the more the disputed land attracts grabbers. “This makes the cases even more complicated, which consequently delays the cases even further,” said Evans Momanyi, the CYCA executive director. Momanyi said grabbers use delaying tactics to forcefully take land from the poor. “The poor eventually get tired because it becomes expensive to keep up with the court battle,” said the rights activist. He spoke at the Mombasa law courts. The CYCA has enjoined the National Land Commission, the Kwale Land Registrar, the Attorney General and New Connection Suppliers, an interested party, in a case seeking orders to stop the sale or transfer a property. It is at the centre of a legal dispute between a woman and eight people who are said to have sold the land to her. According to court documents, Josephine Mwinamo bought 13.3 acres carved out of Kwale/South Samburu/79 for Sh8.36 million from the eight people, who are listed as defendants, on February 16, 2015. The eight include Murina Kambi, Henry Mbita, Ngundi Ndonga, Kambi Kambi, Eliud Yawa, Mangale Mbudzia, Mwachilungo Mwachilungo and Henry Ndaikwa. In an affidavit, Mwinamo said the eight encroached her parcel and entered into another agreement to sell off the land to a third party. The CYCA says the matter has taken too ong to be determined. Justice Munyao Sila of the Environment and Land Court in Mombasa ordered that the matter be heard of October 31. Momanyi said Mwinamo took a loan to buy the land which she cannot develop because of the protracted court case. Meantime, the loan attracts interest. This while, the loan is attracting interest and Momanyi fears Mwinamo may end up defaulting in paying the loan because the case is eating up resources. (Edited by V. Graham)
