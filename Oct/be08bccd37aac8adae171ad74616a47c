Talanta will be aiming to bolster their hopes for a push towards promotion with another win this weekend when they visit new boys APS Bomet. Juma Abdalla’s charges have enjoyed their best-ever start to a National Super League campaign and sit fourth, just three points off top spot in what looks likely to be the closest promotion fight ever with as many as seven teams in with a shout. “Every game in this division is tough but as a team, we are trying to take each a game at a time and manage through five games cycles. So far I think we are within our target and we must maintain this level of competitiveness in our next four games,” said Abdalla’s assistant, Ayub Inziani. Favourites Nairobi Stima have a chance to return to the top of the NSL table when they take on mid-table side Migori Youth. Stima relinquished top spot last weekend after a goalless draw with Mount Kenya United. They have an opportunity to make amends against Migori, who have had a mixed bag of results in their half a dozen matches to sit ninth in the standings. Tomorrow, Nairobi City Stars have the opportunity to firm their grip on top spot when they travel to face Kenya Police in Naivasha. Bidco, who are second, will be away to lowly St. Joseph. Whipping boys Northern Wanderers will be out in search of their first point when they host debutantes Murang’a Seals.
