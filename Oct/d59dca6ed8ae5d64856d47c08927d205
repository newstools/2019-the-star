Parklands will be out to protect their 1-0 lead when they clash with USIU's Mashujaa in the second half their washed off clash at the City Park Stadium today. The match was called off at a half time on Sunday with Parklands leading 1-0 courtesy of Oliver Mugasiali's goal. With only 30 minutes to play, Parklands are confident of guarding their lead and get maximum points. The team is flirting with relegation and assistant coach Kelly Adolwa said the half an hour play is crucial for the team's survival. "Relegation battle is tight because we lost many games. If we lose this one, we are at risk of going to the lower league. Our strategy is to defend from the midfield. We play with two strikers and five midfielders," said Adolwa. "Staying in the league is quite possible if we win against the students and Wazalendo." Meanwhile, his opposite number, John Kabuu said: "It will definitely be a tough. We have to get a fast goal. We were sluggish and therefore self-drive and desire should hit top-notch if we have to overturn their 1-0 lead. A win is still within our reach. It's not over until the final whistle." Victory for Parklands will be their second and will lift them to eighth on the log. They will have the same points as Strathmore (10) but with a superior goal difference. Seventh-placed Mashujaa will move to fifth with 19 points if they get maximum points.
