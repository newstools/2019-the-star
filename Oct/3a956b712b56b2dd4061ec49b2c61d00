A woman accused in the NYS scandal was yesterday charged with Sh20 million tax evasion at a Nairobi court. Phyllis Ngirita, trading as Njewanga Enterprises, faced four counts where she allegedly failed to submit the Sh7 million and Sh13 million taxes in 2016 and 2017 respectively. Appearing before chief magistrate Martha Mutuku in a Milimani court, the accused denied all the charges. Through lawyer Evans Ondieki, Ngirita sought for lenient bail and bond terms claiming her family has been struggling and has even been going hungry. She said her son has been out of school because of fee arrears because all her bank accounts are currently frozen. The accused informed Mutuku that the son, whose father is  German, had been urging her to change his name so he can study comfortably. "Your honour, I have suffered a lot due to the media coverage of the NYS matter. My accounts have been frozen, my vehicles were taken away and now I cannot pay my bills," Ngirita pleaded. "Initially, I was doing well but now l can't make ends meet. I had the millions but now I cannot afford." The prosecution sought to have her given stringent bail and bond terms. She was granted Sh1 million bond and an alternative Sh1 million bail. The matter will be mentioned on November 11. In July, the High Court barred the Ngirita family from accessing any money held at the Kenya Commercial Bank. The orders were granted by Justice John Onyiego following a case filed by Opportunity Internationals Wedco Limited. “An order is hereby issued prohibiting Ngirita and her two siblings from accessing proceeds in Kenya Commercial Bank, Account Number 1109800584 pending hearing and determination of the case,” the court stated. Phyllis Njeri Ngirita, Lucy Wambui Ngirita, and Jeremiah Gichina Ngirita were named as respondents in the case with two companies – including Platinum Credit Limited – being named as interested parties.
