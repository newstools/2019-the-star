Government Spokesman Cyrus Oguna has said at least 29 people have lost their lives countrywide due to floods caused by the heavy rains in the past three weeks. During the same period, 11,700 persons have been displaced and 10,000 livestock swept away. The most heavily affected counties include Lamu, Kwale and Garissa. Sectors that have been affected by the heavy downpours include agriculture, roads, education and water. Oguna has said the national government is working closely with the county government and the Red Cross to provide assistance to the affected counties. "There have been rescue operations enhanced to help those displaced to be taken to safe areas," he said. Distribution of food items to affected communities has also been enhanced with items such as blankets and soap. The met department has also issued intense rain alert in Central, Northeastern and Coastal parts of Kenya asking the public to be on the lookout for floods and landslides.
