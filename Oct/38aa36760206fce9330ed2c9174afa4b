Eight people, including former Kasarani CDF officials, have been charged with embezzlement of Sh48 million of public funds meant for construction of Kasarani Girl's High School. They are Silvan Thomas, Pamela Achola, Jecinta Akoth, Nashon Okumu, Kefa Omanga, Douglas Ntaine, Peter Otingo and Vitalis Ogingo Obunga. Former Kasarani legislator Elizabeth Ongoro, a suspect in the matter, did not appear in court on Monday as she is in South Africa for treatment. In the charges, the former legislator is accused of fraudulently acquiring Sh4 million from Kasarani Girl's Project Management account being part of the money allocated for the construction of Kasarani Girl's High School. The state did not oppose their release on bail, but asked chief magistrate Lawrence Mugambi to impose stringent terms on all the accused persons. The court will rule on bail on Monday afternoon.
