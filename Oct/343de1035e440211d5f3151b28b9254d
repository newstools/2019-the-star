Facing a barrage of cases relating to the upcoming elections, Football Kenya Federation through CEO Barry Otieno has sought the intervention of the world football governing body, Fifa FKF Nyamira sub-branch chairman, Jared Nyauma, has petitioned the Sports Disputes Tribunal challenging the electoral code that was passed by the FKF's Annual General Meeting on October 5 and also the nomination of the electoral board. The SDT deemed it within their mandate to hear the case and set a date of November 5 for interested parties to appear before them. But it is the petition that was presented before the Kenyan High Court that has attracted the attention of Fifa “We refer to your letter dated October  19, 2019, by means of which you informed our services of alleged third party interference in the affairs of the FKF and more specifically their ongoing electoral process," opined the letter by Véron Mosengo-Omba, Fifa's acting Chief Member Associations officer. “In this respect, we consider it of utmost importance to refer you to article 69 of the FKF statutes, according to which 'Disputes within the FKF0 or affecting leagues, members of leagues, clubs, members of clubs, players, officials and other officials shall not be submitted to ordinary courts unless the Fifa regulations, (the FKF statutes) or binding legal provisions specifically provide for or stipulate recourse to ordinary courts,”added the letter to FKF. Mosengo-Omba averred that FKF's article on disputes resolution was in line with one of Fifa’s core principles on the prohibition of recourse to ordinary courts of law unless specifically foreseen by Fifa regulations or binding legal provisions. “ Fifa takes this principle with the utmost seriousness and therefore considers that it is the responsibility of the member associations, including the FKF, to ensure that it is implemented at their level through binding obligations on its members. We further wish to underline that a violation of this obligation by the FKF or its members may lead to sanctions as provided for in the Fifa statutes, including a possible suspension,” warned Mosengo-Omba. On Wednesday, incumbent Nick Mwendwa was the only aspirant to hand in nomination for the presidential elections, opening a sure path to another term in office much to the chagrin of his opponents.
