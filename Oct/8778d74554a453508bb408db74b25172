The Teacher Service Commission has sacked 36 teachers over professional misconduct, CEO Nancy Macharia has said. Macharia on Friday said that their names have been removed from its register. In a gazette notice dated October 4, Macharia said the teachers will not be allowed to teach in any school including private institutions. “In exercise of powers conferred by section 30(1) (e) of TSC Act, the commission wishes to notify the public that the persons whose names appear in the notice have been deregistered,” Macharia said. The teachers were removed from the register between March and June this year. Last month,  TSC sacked 42 teachers for failing to attend training on the competency-based curriculum (CBC) in April and disrupting the exercise in various centres across the country. In a statement, TSC further indicated that 124 teachers are still suspended, 30 have received warning letters while interdiction of 17 teachers has been lifted.
