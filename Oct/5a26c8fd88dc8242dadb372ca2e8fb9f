The Nairobi County Assembly has rejected the Punguza Mizigo bill. More than 80 MCAs voted against the bill on Tuesday, saying that it lacked representation. Deputy Minority Whip Moses Ogeto said the bill undermines the minority tribes in the country. “The bill only speaks for the take it all, but forgets the minority in the this country,” he said. Ogeto also said the bill reduces the number of MCAs from 85 to 17. Roysambu MCA Peter Warutere termed the bill 'toxic'. “Seventy per cent of the bill is good, but 30 per cent is toxic," he said. Kabiro MCA Clarence Munga said that the people of Nairobi were not involved when the bill was drafted and therefore it does not represent their interests. Laini Saba MCA Cecilia Ayot noted that the bill had left out women interests, together with the youths. Majority Leader Abdi Hassan Guyo moved the motion. The rejection makes Nairobi the ninth county to reject the bill, after Nakuru opposed it earlier in the day.
