Aspirants for various positions at the branch level in the Football Kenya Federation elections have until today to submit their nomination papers. Yesterday prospective candidates from Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet, Nandi, Baringo, Nakuru, and Laikipia Counties, submitted their nomination papers to the FKF Electoral Board. The aspirants had their relevant documents scrutinized by the Board’s secretariat after which acknowledgement slips were handed to those who passed the eligibility criteria as stipulated in the Electoral Code. “My branch is doing well and I am very proud of the work that we are doing. It is for this reason that I feel I have what it takes to lead Trans Nzoia as the Chairman for the next four years,” said FKF Trans-Nzoia County Branch aspirant Francis Mayakula Board Chairman Prof. Edwin Wamukoya, meanwhile, noted that the nomination process has been seamless. “We have a website (www.eb.footballkenya.org) where you can find all the relevant information you need on the elections. I am happy that all the aspirants who have come to us are familiar with what is required of them and we haven’t had to send anyone away because of lack of relevant documents,” said Prof. Wamukoya. A  preliminary list of candidates will be released on Tuesday next week with the  County polls slated for November 23, 2019.
