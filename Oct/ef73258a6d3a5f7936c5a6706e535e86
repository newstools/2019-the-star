Migori county assembly has filed an application to court to confirm their suspension of clerk Tom Opere. Through their lawyer Odhiambo Kanyangi, MCAs moved to Employment and Labour Relations court in Kisumu to quash stay orders of the clerk's suspension. In a ruling dated October 22, judge Mathews Nduma Nderi refused to grant the assembly’s wish to suspend the clerk and set the hearing date for December 18. On August 2, the assembly suspended Opere for 90 days as the clerk of the assembly and secretary of its public service board. The assembly said the suspension was to enable further investigations into allegations and other matters pertaining to the performance of Opere’s duties and responsibilities. Muhuru Bay MCA Hevron Maira had in April accused Opere of abuse of office, professional incompetence and gross misconduct arising from procurement and contracts. The assembly summoned the clerk in a letter dated September 9 to appear before the service board to defend himself. But Opere instead, moved to court to quash the suspension. He obtained orders through lawyer Omondi Abande staying his suspension until the matter is heard. His deputy Emmanuel Kingwara has been acting in his capacity, with assembly arguing that the orders 'shall interfere with the operations of the board and county assembly as a whole'. The assembly has been thrown into confusion with rising political heat as North Kanyamkago MCA George Omamba is also in court to quash his August impeachment as deputy speaker. Omamba's and Opere's suspension has been seen as a means to control the assembly against those opposed to Governor Okoth Obado’s administration by supporting Senator Ochillo Ayacko. The tension played out in October when MCAs invaded executives offices to push through the allocation of bursaries with Omamba leading the onslaught. Edited by R.Wamochie
