Bandits attacked several vehicles travelling in Samburu North on Wednesday, killing one driver and seriously injuring four other people. The armed robbers emerged from the bush and attacked along the Laisamis-South Horr-Baragoi road in the early morning. The fatally wounded driver was in a car transporting miraa to Baraboi town. A passenger suffered a bullet wound. Antony Githinji, the driver of another vehicle behind the first, was also wounded. “Seven men emerged from a bush, six were armed with guns and the other one carried rungus. We surrendered and lifted our hands," Githinji said from his bed at Samburu County Referral Hospital. "One man came to the driver's door and ordered me to get out with all the money I had," he said. The bandits also took foodstuffs. A few minutes later, the victims were ordered to drive on and not tell anyone about the robberies. “They told us we were not their target. I tried to drive with one hand but the vehicle stalled and the robbers were forced to help me jumpstart it," a victim identified only as Mwangi told reporters. The four victims in the two vehicles are admitted to the hospital in Maralal town. Tension is high and residents urged the government to improve  security along the road. Hillary Muriuki said five vehicles had been attacked in two days. “We have not received any assistance from police, we want security stepped up because people are losing their lives," Muriuki said.
