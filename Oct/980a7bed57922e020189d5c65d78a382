 The Uasin Gishu county government is losing Sh500 million annually from the national government because it lacks a county referral hospital. Senator Margaret Kamar on Monday told the Senate Committee on Health that the county's former district hospital was elevated to a national referral facility. The senate team chaired by Trans Nzoia Senator Michael Mbito is touring counties to ascertain the status of healthcare. Kamar said the lack of a referral hospital means patients were being taken to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret even for minor ailments. “Since the former district hospital was upgraded and controverted into Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, the county has no any other referral facility," Kamar said. MTRH handles an estimated 2.5 million patients annually, including people from eastern Uganda. Mbito criticised the national government for distributing health equipment to counties without any data on the needs of the facilities. "The facilities are lying idle because of lack of personnel to operate them. It is utterly shocking to find infants being handled in boxes because of lack of incubators,” Mbito said. They were speaking at Ziwas Subcounty Hospital in Uasin-Gishu. The government disburses Sh500 million annually as conditional grants to upgrade health facilities. "It is unfortunate that some of the equipment were procured and dispatched to hospitals without consulting the counties. They remain unused yet the counties are paying for them,” Mbito said. He said maternity wings were in deplorable state and that newborns were being exposed to hazardous environments. About 170 babies are delivered at Ziwa Subcounty Hospital every month. The senators also visited hospitals in Kesses and Moiben.  edited by peter obuya
