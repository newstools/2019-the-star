Coach Peter Mwathi is unperturbed by his Strathmore University women's handball team's dismal performance in the Nairobi South KUSA Conference League at the University of Nairobi Graduation Square over the weekend. In a rather low scoring duel, Mwathi's charges lost 01-23 to Machakos University in their season opener. The tactician, who also doubles up as the men's national team head coach, said there is nothing to worry about as his squad is entirely comprised of rookies. He said the team is only a week old in training and tipped the girls to grow into impressive players in the near future. “I am not worried at all. The team is in its formative stage and I can already tell that the girls will develop into good players. They are putting the time in training and they only need to be more focused,” noted Mwathi whose last season's team graduated from the varsity. But on a more brighter side, Strathmore men's team recorded their second straight victory in the 2019/2020 season by defeating Technical University of Kenya 27-18. The coach said once again, the Madaraka-based outfit want to finish the season unbeaten just like in the previous seasons. “The men's team is still formidable despite some key players graduating. We are still hunting for both the conference and national titles hence there is no room for complacency,” added the veteran trainer. Meanwhile, Machakos University whipped their counterparts from Cooperative 21-12. The latter regrouped against East Africa University whom they beat 30-22 as UoN romped past Multimedia University 25-12 in the men's ties. UoN triumphed against Cooperative 23-07 in the only women's game played.
