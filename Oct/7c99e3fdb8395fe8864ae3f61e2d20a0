A ten-year-old girl has been electrocuted in Meru The girl, who hailed from Linguni area, was going to nearby canteen at Mukuiru in Karama Ward Tigania East when she ran over un-insulated Kenya Power lines that had fallen in a farm in the area and died. She was a pupil at Mukuiru Primary school. The girl’s father, Francis Kirema, told journalists that they are saddened by the death of their daughter and wants KPLC to compensate the family. “It is so sad to lose your beloved in such a cruel manner. We have complained to KPLC to tighten the wires hanging on ground but our cry has fallen on deaf hears. We want them to compensate my family. It is agonizing. Government should as well take action on officers sleeping on their jobs thus endangering lives of others,” Kirema said. Area residents yesterday took to the streets paralyzing transport within the area as they protested the KPLC inability to heed to their calls to uninstall or remove the open wire lines that are hanging on the electricity poles while touching the ground. Residents noted that it is not the first time they have raised concerns over fears that the dangerous lines are a risk to locals' lives. Ann Mutwiri, a protester, said they wondered why KPLC is taking them for-granted until irreparable damage leading to death occurs. On November last year, Francis Mwimbi, 40, was electrocuted at Mulika market, Mikinduri Ward. He died after leaning on an un-insulated electricity wire connected to a post linked to a transformer. Residents had blamed Kenya Power for putting residents' lives at risk. Charles Mutwiri, an uncle to the deceased, told the Star, three other people got an electric shock at the same post, but residents rescued them. Then KPLC Meru County business manager Timothy Waswa told the Star the firm had sent investigators to the site. He did not pick the Star calls or reply to text messages on the girl's incident.
