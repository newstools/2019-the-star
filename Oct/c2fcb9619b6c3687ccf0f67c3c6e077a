The public should embrace mediation to resolve cases because it is a faster and cheaper route to justice, African Divine Church archbishop John Chabuga has said. Chabuga told the Star in Mbale yesterday that mediation not only saves time but also resources used in legal fees. He said that after mediation, conflicting parties can live peacefully as opposed to court resolutions that may leave one party wounded. Isaac Wawire of the Word of Faith Pray Centre said that most of the cases at Vihiga Law court could have been resolved by mediation. Wawire said it is not necessary to run to courts to seek legal services when a case could be resolved by bringing the disagreeing parties on the table. “We are not stopping anyone from seeking legal redress when injured, but the idea is to use mediation to help resolve some of the cases. “For instance, a case between church leaders can be solved better via mediation than the courts,” he said. Vihiga senior resident magistrate Rose Ndombi called for the creation of a mediation section within the court to reduce the backlog of cases. “Most cases are related to succession. There is a need to sensitise the public on the topic since most people seem not to understand the laws governing it,” she said. (edited by O. Owino)
