Paris St Germain forward Neymar will be out of action for four weeks because of a thigh injury, the Ligue 1 leaders said on Monday. “Neymar underwent an MRI (scan) this afternoon... a medical check up will be done in eight days but his return to competition is expected in four weeks depending on the evolution (of the injury),” PSG said in a statement. Neymar picked up the injury during Brazil’s 1-1 draw against Nigeria in a friendly game in Singapore on Sunday. The striker is set to miss PSG’s two Champions League games against Club Brugge next week and on November 6. Meanwhile, former Paris St Germain boss Antoine Kombouare has been named Toulouse coach, the Ligue 1 club have said. The 55-year-old, who coached PSG from 2009-11, replaces Alain Casanova after he and Toulouse ended his contract by mutual agreement last week. Toulouse are 18th in the Ligue 1 standings with nine points from nine games. Kombouare, who also coached RC Lens, Strasbourg and Dijon in France, will be in charge for the first time when Toulouse host Lille on Saturday.
