Three police officers are under arrest for robbing two traders of $60,000 (Sh6.2 million) in Nairobi's Eastleigh estate last Friday. The trio from Kayole police station accompanied by three other suspects still at large stormed room 143 of Barwaka Lodge. The events were captured on CCTV. Two police officers are among those charged in the Sh72 million Standard Bank cash theft. The money was for ATM restocking in Nairobi. These and many more other cases that go unreported taint the name of a service mandated to maintain law and order. There are hardworking and honest police officers who deserve praise, but the bad apples eclipse their good deeds. In fact, Kenyans say it's better to run into thieves at night than meet police on patrol. This shows how untrustworthy our police service is. They have graduated from taking bribes, officers by day and thieves at night. When not hiring their guns to robbers, they themselves steal. Heads of police stations and posts must be accountable for guns issued. The laissez-faire attitude toward armouries contributes greatly to misuse of firearms. Police IG Hillary Mutyambai must enforce proper, well-documented issuance and use of firearms. More than that, the issue of morality — never evident in vettings — must be closely monitored.
