Kenya Cup returnees Silverstone Kisumu RFC and Western Bulls are looking for perfect starts in matchday one of the league today. Kisumu travel to Kakamega for an encounter against last year's Kenya Cup finalists Kabras at Kakamega ASK Showground while Western Bulls are expected in  Nairobi for a tough fixture against champions KCB at Ruaraka. However, Kisumu coach Brian Makalama and Western Bulls assistant coach Obi Solo were yesterday confident of making positive starts. “We have had a perfect pre-season training for the last eight weeks and the boys are ready for the game against Kabras. I know it will not be easy because most players have not played in Kenya Cup before but they are raring to go,” said Makalama, who was poached from Uganda where he was handling the country's Under-19 team. He, however, said his main target is to remain in Kenya Cup. “We will lose some games here and there but we want to maintain our Kenya Cup status,” said Makalama. He replaced Howard Okwemba who guided the team to Kenya Cup. Kisumu strengthened the team with the signings of Aggrey Kitoi from Kisii, Caleb Rotich(Catholic Monks), Ken Oduor (Menengai Oilers0 and Ryan Moses ( Maseno University). Solo, who has been handling the team in the pre-season in the absence of head coach Bram Shikanda, said: “We are playing the champions but it will be a game of 15 against 15. I think the boys are equal to the task and they will fight it out.” He added: “We have players with Kenya Cup experience and it will come in handy this season. They will help young ones cope with the intensity of this league. We have bolstered the squad and we hope to remain in Kenya Cup.” Bulls named the club's oldest serving player Tedy Akala as the field captain with Treasure Odundo remaining the overall captain. Allan Kasiti is the vice-captain. Makalama and Solo said having five teams from outside Nairobi in Kenya Cup is good for the growth of the game.
