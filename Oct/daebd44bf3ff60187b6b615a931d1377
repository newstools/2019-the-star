'Mysterious' disease in Starehe Girls Centre is a case of mass hysteria, the Health Ministry has said. A total of 52 students from Starehe Girls were isolated following cases of the students with a high-pitched cough, sneezing and low-grade fever in the school. The ministry in a statement on Friday said investigations into the cold indicated two cases of rhinovirus. Rhinovirus is the most common viral infectious agent in humans and is the predominant cause of theÂ common cold. The team collected appropriate specimens that were tested at the National Public Health Laboratories. As of October 2, 2019, the number of affected girls had risen to 68. MoH dispatched a team of specialists from Mathari Mental Hospital to the school to conduct a psychological assessment of the affected students. "The team drew a conclusion of mass psychogenic illness also called mass hysteria," the ministry said. The ministry has recommended individual psychological evaluation of the affected students. This is meant to understand the trigger of the outbreak. Also, the ministry wants group therapy for the students as well as staff and caregivers. "There is a need for continuous counselling of the students, sensitisation and awareness creation on mental health and self-care to avert possible future occurrence," it added.
