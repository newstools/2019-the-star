Tusker Lite recently hosted a glow in the dark/neon party at 1824 along Langata Road, treating about 400 revellers with food and music. Consumers were entertained by a dancing crew known as All City East Africa, who gave a memorable performance as curtain-raisers. Khaligraph Jones, the headline artiste for the night, gave an electric performance, leaving the crowd yearning for more. The fun night saw brand ambassadors engage revellers at the point of entry and handed all ladies walking in with glow in the dark masks as revellers got awarded with merchandise, which included branded T-shirts and headphones after purchasing a six-pack of Tusker Lite beer at a subsidised price.
