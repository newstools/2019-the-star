A middle-aged woman died on Thursday after she was stung by bees at Kivaruri near Kanja market in Embu East. Rosemary Wanja was picking tea unaware that honeybees had made a colony in her farm. The vicious insects stang her as she screamed for help from neighbours and passersby. Rescue efforts were futile as the bees attacked anybody who tried to get closer. Antony Njagi was attracted by Wanja's screams.Â  "It took us time to get to where she was. The bees were too many and she had tried to hide in tea bushes where it was not easy to see her. By the time we got to her it was too late," Njagi said. The woman was pronounced dead on arrival at Runyenjes sub-district hospital.
