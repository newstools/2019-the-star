Due to the unpredictable weather outlook by the Met, Kenyans are encouraged to develop a water harvesting and saving culture. First, all taps should be turned off tightly so that they donâ€™t drip. When washing hands, clothes or dishes, use a filled basin as opposed to running water. This water can also be recycled to flush the toilet or wash the car. Leaked taps should promptly be repaired to prevent drips. Kenyans are also advised to use low flow for showers and store water in tanks to reduce the possibility of drought when the taps run dry.
