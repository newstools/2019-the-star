Two buses that got stuck while carrying school children at Tsavo East National Park have been pulled from the mud. The buses were stuck in the park since Thursday evening following heavy downpour, Kenya Red Cross said on Friday. But in a quick rejoinder, Red Cross said they have rescued all the children. Weatherman said heavy rains which are being experienced in several parts of the country are set to continue for the next seven days. A statement from the Kenya Meteorological Department on Thursday indicates that heavy rainfall of more than 20mm in a day is set to be experienced up to Sunday, October 28. The department has warned the public from driving or walking through the moving waters.
