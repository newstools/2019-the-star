The Teacher Service Commission has admitted to erroneously deducting union dues from teachers' September salary. The commission in a press statement on Thursday said the deduction, which affected 3,384 Kuppet members, was due to a system error. This comes after Kuppet in an internal memo signed by their Sec General Akello Misori raised alarm over the deductions. Kuppet in the memo had said though the deductions had reflected on the teachers’ pay slips, the commission had not submitted the same to the union. “Our attention has been drawn to an internal memo signed by Akello Misori, the Secretary General of Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) whose contents are currently circulating on social media,” read a statement signed by head of corporate communications Catherine Lenairoshi. “We wish to clarify that this problem which, regrettably, affected some 3,384 Kuppet members, was due to a system error. This has since been rectified to ensure there is no recurrence,” the statement read in part. As a result, the teacher’s employer said it will not deduct October union dues from the salaries of the affected teachers. “The Commission apologises to the affected teachers and regrets the erroneous deductions,” it said. In April last year, TSC was at logger heads with Knut and Kuppet for what they termed deliberate withholding of their dues. The two unions hit at TSC saying it had delayed to remit their dues amounting to millions of shillings. By then, Kuppet demanded Sh35 million while Knut wanted Sh135 million. The two unions said as a result, they were to run daily operations and other activities. “We write to inform you that for the last two months, you have intentionally delayed remittance to the union account despite having deducted the cash,” a letter written to TSC CEO Nancy Macharia read.
