Vincent Clizz Wangara, alias Vinny, is a young, esteemed entrepreneur. He is the founder and CEO of Vinn Clizz Tailoring Limited. Vinn started doing fashion and design back in 2014, having had a love for tailor-made ultra-formal clothes for men and women. He says to be a fashion designer, one needs to be passionate, creative and have the zeal to embrace fashion. "Clients who are not patient and want their delivery made before the expected date of complete production are so hard to deal with," he told Weekend Star. He says working with impatient clients is the greatest challenge any designer goes through. Vinn has gotten the opportunity to work with different personalities in the country, from children to ladies and gents of all ages. Among his clients are Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli, media personalities as well as musicians. He is behind some of Fena Gitu's tomboy looks. "Fena was pleased after having trusted my craftsmanship and tailored her a double breastpin striped suit that she used in one of her songs," he said. "Atwoli is a perfectionist, and working with him is just amazing. He loves everything put into details." Asked whether fashion and design pay well, and whether he has any message for those joining the industry, Vinn said, "Just like any other job, fashion is business as usual. It depends on how you decide to drive it. Thereafter, it will generate revenue as per your expectations." He has scooped awards from what he does, and that keeps him going. He's been feted at the Pwani Fashion Awards, Kenya Glamour Awards and Kenya Fashion Awards as best designer of the year. "During the latest one, Swahili Fashion Week, which was held in Tanzania, I scooped the award of the best East Africa designer of the year," he said. His message to upcoming young entrepreneurs out there is that, "A successful entrepreneur is a doer, not a dreamer." Vinn Clizz Tailoring Limited is located on the 3rd floor of Victoria Court Building on Tom Mboya Street, Nairobi.
