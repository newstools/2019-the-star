Kenya is among seven countries with high TB burden on course to nearly eliminate the disease by 2030, the World Health Organisation reports. Last year, 150,000 Kenyans were diagnosed with tuberculosis, but the WHO says the declining incidence puts Kenya on track. The WHO's Global TB Strategy aims for a 90 per cent reduction in TB deaths and an 80 per cent reduction in the TB incidence rate by 2030 compared with 2015 levels. To achieve the goal, countries would need a 20 per cent reduction in prevalence by 2020. They would also need to cut TB deaths by 35 per cent by 2020. "Seven high TB burden countries are on track to achieve the 2020 milestones: Kenya, Lesotho, Myanmar, the Russian Federation, South Africa, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zimbabwe," says the WHO in its 'Global Tuberculosis Report 2019'. Last year, 63 per cent of all TB patients in Kenya were on treatment but the country aims to cover more than 90 per cent by 2022 through universal health coverage. Kenya's treatment success rate was 83 per cent last year and only 2,300 people developed drug-resistant TB, mostly because they failed to adhere to treatment regiment. At least 33,000 people were killed by the disease in Kenya in 2018, WHO says. The report notes that as a whole, most WHO regions and many high TB burden countries are not on track to reach the 2020 targets. WHO said priority needs include a new vaccine or effective preventive drug treatment, rapid diagnostic tests and safer, simpler, shorter drug regimens. The report says a promising vaccine that could prevent people with latent TB infection from developing the disease is highly successful. It returned a 54 per cent vaccine efficacy among HIV-negative adults infected with TB in Kenya, South Africa, and Zambia who were followed for over two years in a Phase IIb efficacy trial — which is meant to test the efficacy and safety of a drug. However, the vaccine – called M72/AS01E – needs further tests to confirm if it can protect people with no TB infection, those living with HIV, and people in non-trial countries. The WHO report says the cumulative reduction of TB infections across the world between 2015 and 2018 was only 6.3 per cent, considerably short of the End TB Strategy milestone of a 20 per cent reduction between 2015 and 2020. The global reduction in the total number of TB deaths between 2015 and 2018 was 11 per cent, also less than one-third of the way towards the End TB Strategy milestone of a 35 per cent reduction by 2020. "The good news is that the WHO European Region is on track to achieve the 2020 milestones for reductions in cases and deaths," the report says. "Incidence and deaths are also falling relatively fast in the WHO African Region (4.1% and 5.6%, respectively, per year), with cumulative reductions of 12% for incidence and 16% for deaths between 2015 and 2018."
