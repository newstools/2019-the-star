Hardly do teams that get new status and erect to chase a title in their first time of asking. However, Gaspo FC's dominance in the Women Premier League has shown that everything is possible in sports despite inexperience. The Isaac Maluki-tutored side has taken to the league like a Colossus. Their lead is not by fluke. They have amassed 64 points from a possible 72 and fighting for the title is a realistic target that the tactician has set sight on. With four matches remaining, Maluki admitted to being under pressure. He said their quality has been the difference. Gaspo gained promotion last season after collecting maximum points and are ready for triumph. "In the league, whether you are at the top or bottom, there's always pressure and we have adapted to it throughout. We were promoted with a perfect winning record, therefore, we know what it takes to win the title. We have the best girls in every position and thus, have produced the vast majority of players in the current national team," said Maluki. Goalkeeper Judith Osimbo, defender Wincate Kaari, midfielders Sheryl Angach, Quinter Atieno, Corazon Aquino and striker Elizabeth Wambui are among Gaspo players in the Starlets' squad that face Ghana this evening. Having played two more games than second-placed defending champions Vihiga Queens, who have 61 points, Maluki played down Vihiga's advantage. He said their only focus is on getting results. "We are not focusing on football mathematics at the moment but we will ensure we do our bit and see what happens later." Aside from team focus, the Gaspo coach observed a lack of sponsorship in the women football has been the biggest undoing. Gaspo will not be in action in the league this weekend.
