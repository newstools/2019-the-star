A man left a Nairobi court in stitches after he said he assisted police officers to force a woman to laugh to help them know if she was the suspect they were looking for. The man, who is said that to be a senior military officer based in Sudan, said he was with police officers who invited the suspect to a police van and they together worked hard to make her laugh. “We were forced to be creative and we started very nice stories until she opened her mouth open and laughed out loud when the story ended and they arrested her,” he said. "What made us identify and arrest her was a broken tooth and a gap on the top part of the gum. It was a serious job, your honour. **** A senior prosecutor from the office of the DPP left suspects smiling when he bowed down to pick a police file exposing his old tattered innerwear. The state counsel didn't have a belt, thus exposing his underwear. The state counsel, who seemed confused, asked the court to adjourn all the matters that day. “Let’s be realistic bwana state counsel, you have adjourned all the matters today and you want to go home comfortably and request for a day’s pay? Is that fair?” the magistrate asked. In response, he smiled and told the magistrate, “Your honour, my stand remains. I adjourn this matter. Let him be remanded." **** There was drama at Kibera court after a senior prosecutor who was cross-examining a suspect was forced to explain why he took the cash and failed to stop the case. “Kindly why am I here and you came to my house the night before my arrest and took my cash with the promise of getting me off the hook?” the suspect posed. “Your honour, the prosecutor who is in this case took my money,” the man said. The prosecutor was shocked by the revelations as the magistrate, lawyers, court attendants and clerks looked at him waiting for an answer. He, however, failed to answer the suspect and proceeded to the next question.
