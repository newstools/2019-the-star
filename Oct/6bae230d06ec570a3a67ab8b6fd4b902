The appointment of former Othaya MP Mary Wambui as the chairperson of the National Employment Authority has elicited varying reactions from Kenyans on Twitter. Labour CS Ukur Yatani, through a Gazette notice dated October 14, appointed Wambui as the chairperson of NEA for a period of three years. The agency was launched in May this year, with a mission to formulate and implement employment policies and programmes for the creation of sustainable employment for Kenyans. Mary Wambui Munene succeeded former President Mwai Kibaki as Othaya legislator, but lost the seat in 2014 after the Court of Appeal nullified her election, ruling that it was marred with irregularities. The agency was established in April 2016 by an Act of Parliament (the National Employment Authority Act 2016) which effectively provided the legal framework and mandate for its operations. Wambui has been alleged to be the second wife to formerÂ  President Kibaki, 87. The Wambui family claimed that Mwai married Mary in 1972 under Kikuyu customary law and they had a daughter. However, Kibaki, in 2004, denied the allegation, saying he had only one wife - Lucy - now deceased. On Tuesday, through the hashtag Mary Wambui, KOT questioned Wambui's ability to manage an employment agency at the time when the majority of Kenyans are jobless.
