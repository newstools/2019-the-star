Don't sleep, make more babies with your wives. That's the messsage of Lamu National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF) coordinator Jane Karaya on Thursday. Speaking in Lamu town on Thursday, Karaya said increasing Lamu’s population would ultimately see the government raise funds allocated to NGAAF annually. “We don’t want men sleeping at night. Make babies, please. We need this population to rise as that’s the only way we get more money," Karaya said. Lamu’s low population has been its undoing as it gets low funding and subsequently poor infrastructure, especially in the health sector, she said. The two constituencies in Lamu get Sh.7 million, meaning the entire county gets just about Sh.14 million for affirmative action We have used the little we get to improve infrastructure and put up maternal shelters because we want to encourage childbearing. Please make use of these facilities. We need more money to do more," Karaya said. Lamu continues to get the lowest from the Treasury among all 47 counties due to low population. Lamu women rep Ruweida Obbo has been championing for the NGAAF funds to be increased to at least Sh.14 million per constituency from the current Sh.7 Million. Obbo says the major objective is to improve the lives of women, youth and those with special needs in the region. (Edited by Rosemar Wamochie)
