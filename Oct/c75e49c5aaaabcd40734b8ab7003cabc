A 36-year-old welder has been stabbed to death after a quarrel over flying termites. Daniel Mutiria from Rwankamba village, Marimanti, in Tharaka Nithi County was a welder in Marimanti town. He was stabbed four times in the chest and stomach allegedly by Muriungi Kiyogere, a hotel waiter. Witnesses said the suspect and the victim were drinking beer yesterday and caught some flying termites after the heavy downpour. Witnesses told the Star the deceased collected two basins full of the insects refused to share some with his friend. The attacker had only managed to catch half a basin and wanted a share from his friend. The two neighbours had been great friends, but this argument degenerated into a serious fist-fight before the accused grabbed a knife and stabbed his friend. “He came here and met the victim with two basins full of termites. He had one and wanted more. They disagreed and a fist fight ensued, the suspect removed the knife and stabbed him four times,” a witness said. Tharaka South Subcounty Police Commander Shadrack Rutto said the body of the deceased was found in a pool of blood. He said the suspect ran away to evade the wrath of the irate residents and surrendered himself to Marimanti Police Station, where he is said to have admitted stabbing the suspect. “The killing happened at Kamatungu. The suspect has been arrested and is under police custody at Marimanti Station and we have launched investigations. He will be arraigned in court to answer probable murder charges two days to come,” Rutto said. Rutto said the body of the deceased was taken to Chuka Referral Hospital morgue. “How are we left if he has been killed? God, you are the one who gave this child. I can’t believe,” a witness said. Flying termites can be cooked in a variety of ways: they can be fried, steamed, roasted or boiled.
