The state wants two cases on the multi-billion shilling Kimwarer and Arror dams scandal to be consolidated. One is against former Treasury CS Henry Rotich and PS Kamau Thugge while the other is against former Kerio Valley Development Authority MD David Kimosop and eight others. On Tuesday, the prosecution lawyers Taib Ali Taib and Alexander Muteti told to the court they want the two cases combined since the evidence they will rely on will be similar. The prosecution said in its applications that the two cases arise from similar facts and circumstances and therefore, it will not be prejudicial to the accused persons to merge them. “Consolidation of the cases is to advance the expeditious conclusion of cases,” the prosecution said. Rotich and Thugge are among more than 10 others who have been charged with abuse of office, conspiracy to commit an economic crime, conferring a benefit and single-sourcing for the insurance of the projects and approving payment contrary to the law among other counts. The court heard that they engaged in a project for the construction of Kimwarer multipurpose dam without prior planning.  They denied all the charges. The KVDA, tasked with planning, coordination and implementation of integrated river-based development programs in Kerio Valley Basin, was in charge of the dam projects. Arror dam will produce more than 60 megawatts of electricity once completed and the Kimwarer dam 20 megawatts, which will be connected to the national power grid. The case will come up for mention on October 31. Edited by R.Wamochie
