Eliud Kipchoge’s prowess, determination and zeal is an inspiration to many, including top Kenyan R&B and hip hop sensation Nyashinski. Months ago, Nyashinski released an audio single titled 'Marathon Runner', with an ode to Eliud Kipchoge and retired marathon runner Kipchoge Keino. "When I wrote 'Marathon Runner', I wanted Kenyans to be proud of who they are. To stop living just basic like we don't have greatness," he said in a video released by his management. "The inspiration was from the greatness of Eliud Kipchoge's career. That's why I wrote that song for the sake of Kenyan pride. I wanted people to feel proud of our country. I wanted people to not give up." Adding that, "We thank God for you." The chorus, in particular, goes, “Kipchoge, keep jogging”, and Kenyans across the world have been using this song in particular as “the unofficial soundtrack to the Eliud Kipchoge #INEOS159 challenge”, as seen used by some media houses and especially on social media platforms. The song, which was released in March, is what many Kenyans are listening to in this proud moment. It is currently holding over 1.5 million views on YouTube. Another Kenyan artiste, Kanji Mbugua, has also released a heartwarming song for the legend, called 'EliudKipchoge (Ineos159)'. He wrote, "Eliud Kipchoge represents the best of Kenya and the best of humanity! He challenges us to be the best versions of ourselves! This is my tribute to the greatest marathon runner of all time!"
