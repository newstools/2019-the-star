Mobile court services have been suspended in Kapenguria due to budgetary cut on the Judiciary by the government. Kapenguria High Court Judge Ruth Sitati said mobile services at Alale in Pokot North and Sigor in Pokot Central subcounties were stopped due to logistical problems. Justice Sitati spoke on Thursday during the Kapenguria law court's open day at Kacheliba market. She said, however, that the exercise will resume when the court receives additional funds. “The exercise requires funds which were not allocated during the financial year and we hope that the problem will be sorted out as soon as possible.  I know the distance from Alale to Kapenguria law court is far but we are requesting witnesses to ensure that they attend court when required,” she said. The Judge urged the residents to eliminate barriers that hinder girls from enrolling and completing their education. She said the community should do away with outdated cultural practices like female genital mutilation and early marriages to boost girls' education chances. Subcounty police commander Nathan Sanya said that girls will be most at risk during the upcoming two-month holiday and urged the residents to cooperate by reporting any incidents. Sanya said that girls are known to be taken across to Uganda for FGM to avoid the crackdown on the practice at home. Security officers are working closely with their counterparts in Uganda to prevent this, he said.
