Street deejay Demakufu says he worked as a street hustler before becoming the spin master he is. Speaking to Word Is on Monday, he said, "I have had a long journey. I didn't have enough school fees, so I started hustling in Industrial Area, carrying packed juice. That job finally ended, I went back home and my dad was welcoming, he bought me my first mixer." Adding, "I can tell you that I have come from nothing to something. Be patient and be prayerful to God and ask for favour. DJs are so many and everyone wants to be best. You can be what you want to be." Demakufu, who started off as DJ Firstborn, has an academy that aims to help grow the deejaying industry in Kenya. The father of one will be playing at this weekend at theÂ Mashujaa KC party. "I like appreciating my country and my culture," he said.
