A section of women in Likuyani, Kakamega, on Wednesday demonstrated against increased incidents  of rape and other sexual assaults in the area. They said that four women had been raped and killed in the past two weeks. The protesters, led by former nominated MCA Florence Masika, accused the police of doing little to stop violence against women. Masika said a 65-year-old woman and her 13-year-old niece were raped and strangled to death in Nzoia on the night of October 6. “It’s so painful for someone to rape such a granny and a minor and then kill them,” Masika said. A similar incident happened to a 24-year-old woman on October 1 at Mapendo village. Another 24-year-old woman was raped and murdered at Moi’s Bridge on September 30. The assailant(s) chopped off her limbs after killing her. The women said that no arrests had been made in connection with the rapes and murders. Sango Ward MCA Kennedy Kilwake, who joined the demonstration, called for speedy investigations and arrest of the perpetrators. “These incidences of lawlessness must end. We demand security for our mothers, our wives, our sisters and daughters. We cannot allow this to go on,” he said. Lugari OCPD Patrick Maundu said the public had identified the suspects to the police and that it was a matter of time before they are arrested. “We met with the community leaders and they gave us the names of those the suspects.  You will soon see arrests,” Maundu said. He also said they were cracking down illicit brew traders whose dens he said were the hideouts of the criminals.
