Did President Uhuru Kenyatta recently rebuke a vocal chief administrative secretary for engaging in politics in the ongoing Kibra by-election campaigns? Well, it is said a furious Uhuru confronted the former MP and warned her to shun politics and instead focus on helping the government deliver on its mandate. The CAS plunged headlong into the Kibra campaigns and announced that Uhuru was not behind Jubilee candidate McDonald Mariga in the upcoming November 7 poll. Corridors of Power understands that the president was unhappy because his name was being dragged into the campaigns by government officers even when he had not sent out a message. =========== The widow of a former powerful government official in the Moi and Kibaki era has found herself in a tight spot. The woman is now under siege over money laundering and fraudulent land transactions dating back to the 1990s. Her late husband built a massive financial base with the family's investments spread across nearly all sectors of the economy. At the time of his death, he was tipped for bigger things. Some of the investments he left behind could now return to haunt his widow who is herself dripping with cash. She is now in a panic, with word that the anti-graft agency and the DCI are zeroing in on her. ============ While the Building Bridges Initiative team concluded their assignment on Wednesday, they wound up their work on a high note. The 14-member taskforce, while thanking Kenyans for making their submissions, failed to acknowledge that the BBI report will be handed over to both President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. The Yusuf Haji-chaired team only gave a reference that the report was ready and would be handed over to the president once his diary is fixed. Many Kenyans were left wondering if the omission of Raila's name from the statement by the BBI joint secretaries was deliberate or inadvertent. However, sources said some of the moves made by the team are legal tactics as some people are already in court questioning the legality of the taskforce. =========== Have goons taken over security matters at Nairobi county offices? Since wrangles hit the county assembly following the dramatic return of Speaker Beatrice Elachi, self-appointed bodyguards have taken charge of County Hall. In fact, during the swearing-in of new County Assembly Service Board members on Wednesday, some of the goons had taken strategic positions around the assembly. The thugs were under instructions to deal with those who would disrupt the ceremony. It is not clear under whose instructions they had been hired, but some of them have been seen hovering around top county officials.
