Multiple Standard Chartered Half Marathon champion Valary Aiyabei will give this year's edition, set for Sunday at Nyayo Stadium, as she targets to lower her marathon personal best at the Frankfurt Marathon. Aiyabei made history by winning the past two editions of the 21km race but will not be gunning for a hat-trick of title as she seeks to rule the German city on her debut, also on Sunday. The 29-year old clocked 1:12:06 at the 2017 edition and massively lowered it to 1:11:04 last year. Ayaibei, who is also the Kabarak Half Marathon champion, revealed that she chose to make her debut inÂ  Frankfurt ahead of the Nairobi event in a move aimed at lowering her personal best of 2:20:5, set in Berlin in September 2017. She revealed she has been inspired by Brigid Kosgei, who smashed the 16-year-old women's marathon record last week in the Chicago Marathon. "The management did not list me as they had already settled for Germany. It has been a long season and I want to finish by lowering both my personal and season's best in the Frankfurt race," she said. "We have had new records in the marathons recently and this is an inspiration ahead of the event." Aiyabei, who won the Beijing Marathon in September last year, where she timed 2:21:28, disclosed that she has prepared for the assault for more than five months. She said the Kabarak feat in September, where she crossed the line at 1:15:01 and the Safaricom Iten 10k run held in August, were part of the preparations. "I have been silently working to win the race for the last five months or so. I have not participated in long races for the better of the year which is part of the preparation to my bid. I tested myself in shorter races held in August and September and my body responded well. I head to Germany hoping that I will win the race and record a better time."
