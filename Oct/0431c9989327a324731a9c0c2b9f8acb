BY SHABAN OMAR Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya has put non-performing county staff on notice. He said on Friday he will not tolerate incompetent individuals from derailing county development and service delivery. Speaking in Matuga during the swearing-in ceremony of the new Public Service Board members, Mvurya said some county employees do not give value for the salaries they earn. "You were not hired for any other reasons but for your services to the locals. Failing that, you will be sent home. It will not be business as usual,” he said. He cautioned the county staff against politicking, adding that they should serve wananchi. The county chief said promotions and employment will be on merit. “My friends, if you give it your best, great things will happen in your career growth." The second-term governor warned that he will monitor performances of all the county staff and ensure their output is aboveboard. "You all need to take employment seriously. Many Kenyans do not have any formal employment. Therefore, we can't keep lazy workers at the expense of other deserving citizens," Mvurya said. Mvurya said his office receives hundreds of job applications from graduates daily. He expressed confidence that the board will deliver on its mandate. His sentiments were shared by Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani, who promised to weed out unproductive staffs. "We’ll not protect lazy staff. If you do not perform, you will be kicked out.”
