A case in which the ex-mistress of businessman Joseph Kori and a car hire dealer are charged with murdering his wife Mary Wambui failed to proceed yesterday at the High Court in Kiambu. The case was scheduled for hearing before Justice Christine Meoli but was adjourned after the court was informed that a third party and one of the accused, Judy Wangui, claimed ownership of vehicles police impounded during investigation. The judge adjourned the case until an application for release  of the vehicles is heard and determined. The prosecution will say whether they will be using them as exhibits. She directed the parties to file and serve the application to other parties and return to court on February 4 for hearing. Wangui and Michael Mathenge, a car hire dealer, deny killing  Wambui at the former’s residence at Four Ways Junction Estate on the Kiambu Road on the night of January 26. They allegedly clobbered her on the head with a pressure cooker before strangling her. Detectives investigating the murder of  Wambui believe her husband’s ex-mistress,  Wangui, plotted the murder. Kori has since recorded a statement with the police supporting the claims and is now a state witness. Justice Meoli granted each of the accused a bond of Sh5 million or Sh2 million cash bail.
