DIB Bank Kenya Limited (DIB), which offers exclusively Shariah Banking services, has opened a new branch in Eastleigh, Nairobi,  in an expansion strategy to reach its target market. The lender targets mainly commercial enterprises, small and medium enterprises and individual customers. The expansion to Eastleigh, one of the country's most vibrant business hubs, marks the beginning of a plan that will see the bank expand its activities in the Kenyan market to better serve customers, its management said on Tuesday. The expansion will entail a combination of branches expansion, strategic partnerships and diversification of product range leveraging on technology to meet growing customer needs, it said. “Since we opened shop in Kenya two years ago, we have invested Sh4.3 billion. We are committed to delivering excellent services to our customers in a convenient manner by taking our banking services closer to our customers and hence the official launch of our Eastleigh branch,” said DIB Bank Kenya CEO Peter Makau. The Eastleigh branch, which is located at the Mega Plaza shopping mall along Eastleigh First Avenue Street, has increased the choice of Shariah banking services to the Eastleigh community. “Currently, DIB has presence in Nairobi and Mombasa counties with five branches in total. The bank will also be officially launching its new branch in Mombasa in two weeks,” added Makau. Those present at the launch included, the area MP Yusuf Hassan, the chairman of the Eastleigh Business Community Ibrahim Hussein, prominent Eastleigh business personalities and DIB directors Stephen Mainda and Michael Murphy.
