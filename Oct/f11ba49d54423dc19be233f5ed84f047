The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has launched a probe into ODM claims of rigging in the November 7, Kibra by-election. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said the commission has appointed an investigator to follow up on any allegations of malpractices in Kibra. Chebukati spoke on Wednesday after meeting ODM officials who had earlier demanded to be provided with a register of all voters in Kibra ahead of the by-election. Leaders in the closed-door meeting include ODM chairman John Mbadi, Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna, Florence Mutua (Busia woman representative), MPs Babu Owino (Embakasi East), TJ Kajwang' (Ruaraka) and Executive Director Oduor Ong'wen. The IEBC chief said all poll officials will be shared with political parties through the Registrar of Political Parties. He said there will be no transmissions of results from polling stations to the tallying centre. "Kiems kits will be only for identification. Some polling stations might change due to school program and voters will be updated in good time. A comprehensive update will be made available on Friday next week," Chebukati said. The IEBC boss said an amalgamation of the 2017 register and those who registered to date will be made available immediately to the Orange party. "No registered voter will be left behind. Ballot papers are ready and will be printed locally by Delarue Printing Company," he said.
