FIFA have given Kenya a road map towards the formation of an all-encompassing National Disputes Resolution Chamber (NDRC). Fifa’s major aim at a congress that included football officials from Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe was to guide the member associations on how to constitute an impartial and independent tribunal with the right muscle to tackle contractual related disputes that may arise to a finality. A six-member team from Kenya; two each from FKF’s Player Status Committee and Kenya Footballers Welfare Association (KEFWA) as well as a team representative from the Kenyan Premier League (KPL) and second-tier National Super League (NSL) attended the Lusaka congress. The team was led by FKF’s head of Projects and National teams Michael Kamure and also included former professional women's player Doreen Nabwire from the technical department. Currently, the FKF handles all cases to do with teams and players through the Player Status Committee (PSC) with an upper channel being the Independent Disciplinary Appeals Committee (IDAC). The KPL has the Independent Disciplinary Complaints Committee (IDCC) and its own IDAC separate from that of the FKF. It, however, has limited jurisdiction over contract-related matters. Besides those entities, there exists the Sports Disputes Tribunal (SDT), that handles sports-related disputes and there are the courts where some clubs and players head to seek an audience.
