A section of schools closed by the government in Kisii over poor infrastructure and lack of trained teachers have reopened in suspicious circumstances. At least two private schools in Nyaribari Chache's Irondi area were in session yesterday, despite having been closed. Education director Pius Ngoma said he would investigate the reopening of the schools. At St Anananias Academy, a handful of pupils and teachers were still in class barely a week after education officials closed it. During the inspection, five of its eight teachers had been absent. But yesterday, a teacher at the school told the Star the colleagues had returned and operations had resumed. "The assessors did not find them and there were others who didn't have TSC numbers, but that has since remedied," the teacher told the Star. The school director was away when the Star visited. Classes also resumed at the nearby Kenyerere Academy. Villagers said several schools in the area lack qualified teachers. They blamed the problem on poor pay that ends up attracting only the untrained. "Few teachers can operate without money, which is a major problem here," Titus Mogire said. In Bobasi, however, Riambase DEB Primary remained closed. It was among the 52 schools closed last week in the ongoing crackdown on schools that lack trained teachers and basic facilities. Most of the schools are private.
