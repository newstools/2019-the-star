Equity Bank's Moyale branch operations manager was yesterday charged with robbery with violence involving Sh47 million. Court documents say Roba Diba robbed the cash from Nelson Langat a Wells Fargo Limited officer who was escorting it. The manager allegedly threatened to shoot Langat with a pistol at Odda airstrip in Moyale. He denied the charges before magistrate Kevin Cheruiyot at the Milimani law courts and was released on a Sh1.5 million cash bail. Diba and Lang'at, a Wells Fargo officer, were arrested at the Moyale Airstrip last month. They appeared in court on September 16 before senior principal magistrate Bernard Ochoi where the police sought to hold them for 21 days. Wilson Koech, an officer from the Special Crimes Prevention Unit, swore an affidavit alleging the suspects' involvement in the theft. In the affidavit, Koech said Diba was well informed of the arrival of the cash at the bank and was on duty to receive it. He also noted that Langâ€™at was assigned to escort the money to the bank. "Preliminary investigations showed that the respondents were aware of the regulations and security standards to be followed when handling the cash," Koech said. He further added that the two should not have allowed the pilot to land at Odda airstrip without proper security measures in place. The matter will be heard on November 4.
