Eliud Kipchoge has done Kenya proud. Here comes an athlete who does not allow his achievements to block his vision for mankind. His down to earth mien and humility is worth emulating by sportspeople. Sports has not been given enough attention by successive governments since Independence. This is manifested in the state of stadia, corruption and poor management and a lack of elaborate plans at the grassroots. The move by Safaricom to recognise Kipchoge is worth emulating by other corporates to psych up sportspeople for success.  Nairobi
