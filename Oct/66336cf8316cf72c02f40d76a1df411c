Government spokesperson  Cyrus Oguna has dismissed claims in social media that the Nairobi Expressway will occupy part of the iconic recreation facility that is Uhuru Park. Oguna on Thursday clarified that the project, launched last week by President Uhuru Kenyatta, will not occupy more space of Uhuru Park apart from the 23 metres that had already been earmarked by the Kenya Highways Authority for Uhuru Highway. "Concerns raised by Kenyans over the Nairobi Expressway and it's hiving off Uhuru Park have been raised by Kenyans. We wish to clarify that the 23 meters into the park are road reserve for Uhuru Highway, thus, Uhuru Park remains untouched," Oguna said. The government spokesperson added that the government has made deliberate efforts to ensure that minimise land acquisition for the project. The project is approximated to cover 35 acres of which 60 per cent is public land and 40 per cent from the private property. He said the project will significantly decongest traffic in Nairobi, hence saving the country millions of shillings per year. A recent report released by the Institute of Economic Affairs and World Bank indicated that the country loses over Sh18 billion annually due to the traffic congestion. Oguna said the 27 km project will employ about 3,000 people during the construction and 500 once it starts operation. The government said Sh59.9 billion will be used in the project, fully funded by the China Road and Bridges Corporation. Kenyans on Twitter on Wednesday expressed disappointment the expressway claiming that will cut through Uhuru Park. On Wednesday, the hashtag #HandsoffUhuruPark, was the top trending topic as Kenyans voiced their displeasure in the project.
