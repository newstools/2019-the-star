The state has been sued for withdrawing diplomatic passports from High Court judges and denying them access to VIP lounges at airports. Jonathan Munene, who lodged a case in court, on Monday said the decision by the government poses a serious threat to the independence of the Judiciary. He has sued Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and the director of Immigration. Munene also listed the Kenya Judges Welfare Association as an interested party in the case. According to suit papers, the exclusion of judges followed publishing of a legal notice in 2012. The legal notice listed government officials who are entitled to diplomatic passports and who are allowed to use VIP lounges, but excluded High Court judges who used to enjoy the benefits in the past. Munene wants the court to quash the legal notice and restore to judges the benefits of diplomatic passports and use of VIP lounges.
