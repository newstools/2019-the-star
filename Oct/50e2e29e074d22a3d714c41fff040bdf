The government has announced an ambitious tree planting exercise as part of its restoration of the Maasai Mau forest. Environment CS Keriako Tobiko said that the government will undertake an immediate restoration programme aimed at planting 10 million indigenous trees within recently reclaimed areas. The event will take part on November 1 with a target of planting (including aerial seedling) three million indigenous tree seedlings. "We invite members of the public, institutions, corporate organisations and partners to donate seedlings and participate in tree planting activities," Tobiko said in a statement on Saturday. Earlier this month, the government launched a national drive to plant more than 50 million seedlings during the ongoing short rains. Tobiko said the move is one of the ways in which forest cover will be increased to at least 10 per cent by 2022. The national forest cover currently stands at 7.2 per cent. At least Sh48 billion is needed for the campaign that will enable the country to plant at least 1.8 billion trees between now and 2022.
