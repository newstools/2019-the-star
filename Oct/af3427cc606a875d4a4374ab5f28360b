Police in Gilgil are looking for a man suspected of hacking his wife to death as their children watched in horror on Tuesday morning. The mother of seven was killed using a panga in Kambi Turkana village, Eburru/Mbaruk ward. Emotions ran high among relatives and friends as police collected the mutilated body. The suspect was released from prison a couple of months ago after serving five years for attempting to rape one of his daughters. A neighbour said they heard screams but before they could reach the home, the woman went silent. The neighbour said the deceased’s children narrated what happened to their mother. “Since the man was released from prison, he has been accusing his wife of infidelity, and we suspect that this is the motive behind the murder,” the neighbour said. Gilgil police boss Emmanuel Opuru said they are yet to establish the motive behind the murder. “The woman had deep cuts all over her face and some fingers had been chopped off using a sharp object,” Opuru said. He said initial investigations pointed to the husband as the main suspect and they are looking for him to record a statement. The body was taken to Gilgil mortuary Meanwhile, a drug peddler was arrested in Gilgil while selling bhang to police officers. The officers acting on a tip-off had approached the peddler and sought his services, saying they wanted large quantities to sell to their ‘customers’. Opuru said they had been tracking the peddler for a long time before they caught up with him. “The man supplied the officers with more than 500 stones of bhang. He is in custody waiting to be arraigned on Wednesday [today],” he said. Opuru said the suspect has been selling bhang to students in the area.
