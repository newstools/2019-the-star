Sports betting firm BetLion has announced that its customers using Safaricom will access its website at no cost to their internet data bundles. The offer is set to rejuvenate sports betting in Kenya which has been shaken in the past three months with two leading firms- SportsPesa and Betin announcing exit over tax dispute with the government. “We released a low data usage platform and we have now gone one better by making it free to access,” Spencer Okach, managing director BetLion said. He added that entertainment should be welcoming and therefore accessing it at no cost satisfies that principle. The firm is seeking to ride on high internet penetration in Kenya to expand in the country and East Africa, before spreading to other eight African countries including Zambia and West African states. “We have ambitions to become the only Pan African company in the region and we believe that together with our personalised customer service and the willingness of the African people to take up new ventures, we will be able to make that dream a reality,” he said.
