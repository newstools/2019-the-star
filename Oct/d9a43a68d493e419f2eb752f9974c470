Paris St-Germain are sweating over Neymar after the forward limped off after 12 minutes as Brazil were held to a 1-1 friendly draw by Nigeria. The 27-year-old walked off holding his left thigh and could be a doubt for the Champions League game against Club Bruges on 22 October. Rangers’ Joe Aribo gave Nigeria the lead in the first half as he slotted past Manchester City’s Ederson. Real Madrid’s Casemiro prodded in from close range to equalise just after half-time. After the match Brazil manager Tite said Neymar 'felt a muscle injury' and was substituted as a 'precaution'. Despite having 70% possession in Singapore, Brazil were unable to find a winner to remain winless in this international break after drawing 1-1 with Senegal on Thursday. Meanwhile, Inter Milan forward Alexis Sanchez faces a spell out after picking up an ankle injury on international duty. Sanchez - on loan at the Italian club from Manchester United — was hurt in the second half of Chile’s 0-0 friendly draw with Colombia in Alicante and replaced in the 87th minute. The Chilean Football Federation said the 30-year-old has ‘dislocated tendons’ in his left ankle. Sanchez has returned to Milan for further assessment. Sanchez, who joined Antonio Conte’s Inter on a season-long loan deal in August, scored on his first start for the Serie A title hopefuls against Sampdoria on 28 September, and he also impressed in their Champions League defeat at his former club Barcelona.
