Kitui residents will no longer enjoy immediate benefits upon registration with the county medical insurance scheme. The ambitious Kitui County Health Insurance Cover meant to offer quality and affordable health care to 270,000 residents was launched by Governor Charity Ngilu on August 21 last year. The department of health and sanitation announced that it has varied the maturity period for KCHIC membership from the initial 24 hours to 30 days. County director of medical services Allan Owino announced the change in a letter to all medical superintendents in charge of Level 4 hospitals. Owino ordered the health officials to share the  information with the public. He did not disclose why the insurance cover maturity period was increased. “In the last financial year, during the piloting of KCHIC and all operations to it, the maturity period of KCHIC membership was 24 hours. You are notified that the maturity period has been increased to 30 days,” said the letter dated September 26. Kitui residents pay Sh1,100 to register for KCHIC and access services in all Level 4 hospitals free of charge for one year. Owino said renewal of membership for those who have held the card for one year commenced on October 1 at all Level 4 hospitals.
