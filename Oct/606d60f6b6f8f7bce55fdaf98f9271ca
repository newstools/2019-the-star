State House has defended President Uhuru Kenyatta's foreign trips, saying they will benefit the nation. This comes after the Star ran a story documenting the President's 31 trips in 21 months. Nzioka Waita, the Chief of staff in the office of the President, took to Twitter on Wednesday to say it is Uhuru's job to position Kenya on the world stage. Uhuru left the country on October 21, heading to Japan after Mashujaa Day celebrations in Mombasa. He is currently in Saudi Arabia. He will proceed to Botswana for the official swearing-in of President-elect Eric Mokgweetsi Masisi. In Japan, Uhuru witnessed the enthronement of the new emperor, which was the climax of a long and detailed succession process that started on May 1. He later left for Sochi, Russia, where he attended the inaugural Russia-Africa Summit. The President's trips come amid call for austerity measures as the country grapples with the debt burden.
