Kiambu Deputy Governor James Nyoro wants the order barring him from effecting any changes in the county lifted, arguing that it is hurting service delivery. Nyoro, through lawyer Kibe Mungai, said on Thursday in a replying affidavit that there was nothing tabled before the Employment and Labour Relations Court to justify the orders, which Justice Onesmus Makau issued last week. Makau barred the DG from reshuffling any member of the county executive or any other chief officers. Nyoro said he has been discharging his duties diligently since “I became the acting governor of Kiambu County” and as such, the order should be lifted to ensure the smooth operations in the county government. Marion Njeri Njoroge has sued Nyoro, claiming that he has made numerous irregular appointments and reshuffled the county executive members without legal basis. She said he re-assigned Francis Kigo Njenga from Finance and Trade dockets, powers only exercised by the Governor or the County Services Board. Nyoro also questioned the jurisdiction of the court to issue the order given that there are two pending matters before the High Court, over the same issue. He said he requires sufficient legal capacity and scope to discharge his functions to ensure smooth service delivery, efficient governance and accountable administration. “I am convinced that this would not be possible if on the basis of contested interpretation of the law the courts decide to issue orders to hamstring the discharge of those functions,” he said. The DG took over the running of the county after Governor Ferdinand Waititu was barred from accessing his office over corruption-related charges. The court barred him from accessing the county offices, stating that that did not amount to removal but intended to ensure the integrity and credibility of the trial and also ensure that public interest is safeguarded. The case will be heard on October 8.
