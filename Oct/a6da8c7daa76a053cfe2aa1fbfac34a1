Kaimosi Friends University College wants the Vihiga government to relocate a road that passes nearby. It says traffic noise disrupts learning, especially on Thursday and Friday when people travel to collect bodies of their loved ones from the Jumuia mortuary. The university management wants the road diverted to Shamakhokho. Also affected are Kaimosi Primary School, Kaimosi Girls, Kaimosi vocational Training Centre and university staff quarters. But MCA Calistus Ayodi said the road is dilapidated and should be improved. The university said the noise hurts most learners. It also appealed to the county to erect streetlights along the Cheptul-Jumuia–Shamakhokho road to curb crime. The management addressed the county administration in Kaimosi University Hall during an extravaganza organised by the county to recognise schools that topped in the recent national music competition. Governor Wilbur Ottichillo said they are mapping the Kaimosi-Cheptul to upgrade it to a municipality. "Once this place is upgraded to a municipal status, it will benefit from both the national and the county government,” he said. The governor urged residents to promote their culture and deviate from the foreign culture that has dominated the space. He called for the development of talent centres in all subcounties. His sentiments were echoed by Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi, who urged students to exploit their talent as a way of solving unemployment. County director for education Hellen Nyang’au urged the county to document these young talents for future reference. "They can help in income generation for this county just as I've seen in other counties," she said. (Edited by F'Orieny)
