Siaya residents should elect development-oriented leaders to uplift the region's status, Ida Odinga has said. Ida on Saturday told residents that they have the power to decide who ascends to leadership positions in 2022. She was responding to Sigomer​​e residents' appeal to bless 'their son' Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi in 2022 to succeed Governor Cornell Rasanga. She said she can only give advice but "the final decision lies in the hands of Siaya residents". Ida added that if they use their votes wisely, they will need no blessings for their preferred candidates. However, Ida also took the chance to ask residents to embrace unity even as they will be advocating for their preferred candidates. She said Kenyans are peace-loving people "but unfortunately, politics creates unnecessary animosity forcing brothers to turn against each other". "Let's emulate Eliud Kipchoge's unity of purpose where he has united the entire world through his hard work," she said. She congratulated Kipchoge for making Kenya proud and challenged leaders to do the same by embracing peace. Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi said it's only through peace that the country can grow economically. Wandayi regretted that the country has always embraced unity only when calamities strike and not in terms of development. He also challenged leaders to emulate the spirit of unity of purpose not only in Siaya but in the entire country. The Ugunja MP said it is the same unity that will realise a peaceful referendum to make Kenya a better nation. Other leaders who also attended included Siaya county assembly speaker George Okode and other MCAs. Edited by R.Wamochie
