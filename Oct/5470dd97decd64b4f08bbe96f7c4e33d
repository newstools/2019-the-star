The clan of male MCA who was beaten and injured by a female nominated outside the Kakamega county assembly says it will curse her. Barasa Wambulwa was attacked by Nominated MCA Lilian Osiema on Tuesday afternoon within the county assembly precincts but not the chamber itself.   "Even if it were my own wife who did that, she would have to be sent to her parents with whom she'll come back with to face the elders and rituals performed, including paying fine, before being readmitted home," he told the Star on the phone. He said the elders will curse his attacker.Â  He declined to say whether rituals will be performed before the curse. He said the MCA beat him up recklessly, causing him embarrassments before his colleagues. Wanbulwa said that will also report the attack to the police and seek legal redress. He denied calling Osiema or other nominated woman representatives prostitutes. "We were seated next to each other and she kept pulling my coat back to force me to sit down anytime I tried to stand up to catch the eye of the speaker so I could contribute to the debate. I reprimanded her several times and she stood and went out where she armed herself with a walking stick and laid in wait for me," he narrated "When the session was over and members were filing out of the Chambers, she accosted me at the door and challenged me to repeat what I was saying before she started beating up but I was restrained by colleagues," he said. He said that he lost his keyless ignition for his vehicle during the confrontation. The assembly was debating a report by the health services and sanitation committee report that indicted top health officials for alleged loss of Sh6.6 million. Osiema will lose her Sh39, 000 monthly commuter allowance, her parking sticker, monthly airtime allowance of Sh 5, 000 airtime and insurance cover, She will be persona non grata in the assembly precincts.
