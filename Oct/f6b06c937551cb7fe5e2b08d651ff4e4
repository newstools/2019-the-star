Kenya’s hopes of qualifying for next year’s ICC Twenty20 World Cup in Australia came to an end after being blown away by Papua New Guinea (PNG) yesterday. Kenya were chasing a modest 118 as they sought a win that would catapult them to the playoffs of the 14-team event but instead crashed to 73 all-out. Kenya’s failure saw Scotland clinch a place in the knockout phase. Kenya began the match on a sound note restricting PNG for 19 for 6 after only 24 balls but poor bowling decision once again saw PNG post 118 which ended up being a huge task to the Kenyans. Kenya made three changes from the team that lost to Namibia on Friday by resting Elijah Otieno for Emmanuel Bundi, Rakep Patel for Rushab Patel and Pushpak Kerai for Nelson Odhiambo. The decision seemed to pay off as Bundi, playing his first match of the tournament, almost single-handedly kept Kenya in the tournament with a four— that began with a triple-wicket burst in the second over. Tony Ura drove to mid-off, Assad Vala was trapped lbw, Charles Amini edged behind to make it 12 for 3. Lucas Oluoch struck twice in the third as Lega Siaka edged to slip before Riley Hekure fended another edge behind. Kiplin Doriga then chased a wide ball in the fourth to make it 19 for 6 and four for Bundi. At this point, it looked like PNG will not recover but they managed to settle in and moved to 96 for 6, thanks to some passive tactics from Kenya.
