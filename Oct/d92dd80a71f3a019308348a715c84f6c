Four people have been arrested after another foiled bank heist in Ruiru. The four were planning to steal money from Barclays Bank ATM at Ruiru in Nairobi, DCI boss George Kinoti said. They are; Hillary Ng'eno(from KK security), Jared Nyang'au(G4S), Douglas Momanyi (bodaboda rider) and Jacob Barasa. Via Twitter on Wednesday, Kinoti said detectives recovered a mobile phone which they were using to make contact with a source. A nylon sack which was to be used to in loading the cash and a motorbike were also recovered. The four are in police custody as investigations commence. This comes after Sh74 million got lost from Standard Chartered Bank after an ATM heist. The act which was well-orchestrated, was carried out by men posing as police officers. Several people including police officers have been arraigned in relation to the act with some cash being recovered.
