World record holder Eliud Kipchoge has made history by being the first human to run a marathon in under two hours. Kipchoge crossed the finish line in 1:59:40. Asked how he felt about running under two hours, he said, "I'm the happiest man. I'm feeling good. It's taken 65 years for a human being to make history. I have tried... It means no man is limited." "The first kilometres were hard. It needs perserverance. I appreciate the 41 pacemakers for volunteering to do the job. I want to tell Kenyans that anyone can step out of their cocoon." Kipchoge said he wants to make sports an interesting game where people wake up and run. Here are sights from the Ineos challenge.
