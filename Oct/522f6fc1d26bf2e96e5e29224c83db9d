The government has failed to fix the leadership crisis at Masinde Muliro University in Kakamega, Amani National Congress party leader Musalia Mudavadi has said. He said top administrators of the university are in acting capacity and cannot deliver. “It is unfortunate to have here people who have been acting for more than a year and if anybody is acting he cannot make serious decisions because he is always sitting on the edge,” Mudavadi said. “That is dangerous for any institution and more so when it is an institution of higher learning. We cannot afford to have this.” The ANC leader spoke on Thursday during the requiem mass for Adelaide Khalwale, wife of former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, who was an employee of the university. The vice chancellor, deputy vice chancellor planning, research and innovation, and the deputy vice chancellor academic and student affairs, administration and finance are all acting. Others are the dean of students, registrar academics and the librarian. Mudavadi said the Jubilee government has the responsibility to make sure universities and other institutions run smoothly. "On this one, the blame lies squarely on the Jubilee government. They have to make a decision,” Mudavadi said. Kenya University Staff Union Masinde Muliro university chapter chairman Onzere Mulongo decried the situation at the university, saying the institution was wobbling and could collapse. “This institution has had acting managers since November last year. We have had to cry about many of our institutions in this region collapsing. Let us not allow that to happen for Masinde Muliro University,” Mulongo said. “When a leadership is not given sufficient time to perform a duty, they are always in a state of uncertainty. We cannot allow MMUST to join the league of Mumias Sugar and Pan paper companies in this region.” He called upon the political class led by the ANC party leader Mudavadi to petition the government to take action and save the university.
