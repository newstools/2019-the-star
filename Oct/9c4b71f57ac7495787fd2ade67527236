Ride-hailing firm Bolt, formerly Taxify, has appointed Kenneth Micah to head its East African operations. Having served as the firm’s operations manager over the last two years, Micah has been picked to drive the taxi-hailing app’s expansion across the East African region. “We are thrilled about what this means for our business as we continue to rapidly scale and widen the scope of our operations across Africa and beyond,” Bolt expansion manager for Africa Karl Aru said Prior to joining Bolt, Micah worked at M+R Spedag Group as manager in charge of business intelligence and analysis, where he helped the board to have greater insight into the performance of the business for better strategic decisions. He also worked at Deloitte East Africa between 2011 – 2015, serving in different capacities in the Corporate Finance and Audit departments. Before then, he started his career at PwC as a project management consultant between January 2010 and August 2011. “I am delighted to see where this challenge takes me and how we will grow this company together to drive value for customers and help Bolt achieve its mission of making urban transportation more convenient and affordable for people,” Micah said. Bolt seems to be restructuring its top management having picked Olaoluwa Akinnusi to head their business in Kenya in May.
