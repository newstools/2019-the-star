Kiambu acting Governor James Nyoro have warned that he will name and shame county executive committee members who are sabotaging development progress in the county. Nyoro said there are some CECs hampering development agenda to make him look like he is not working. "There are some CECs that are waiting for someone to return hence they are not working so that I may look like I am not doing anything. But when is that time coming? We do not know and we cannot sit and wait without working," Nyoro said. The acting county chief spoke on Saturday during an agricultural show at Waruhiu Agricultural Training Centre in Githunguri subcounty. He said he knows those county government workers dragging them down waiting for Governor Ferdinand Waititu. "If I am pulled down by anyone working for the government in terms of development progress, I will tell Kiambu people who they are so that the people know because we have lost two years already and we need to deliver our agenda," he said. In September, Nyoro was defied by some CECs who have pledged loyalty to Governor Waititu who was ordered by the court to stay out of office due to a graft case. They said Nyoro has no authority over them according to the Constitution. Nyoro, in order to stamp his authority, reshuffled the Cabinet sending Finance CEC Kigo Njenga to the Trade docket. But Njenga refused to move. Transport executive Juliet Kimemia and Karungo Wa Thangwa (Youth affairs) are also said to be at loggerheads with the deputy governor. Nyoro, however, hailed the Agriculture department saying they are working for the benefit of Kiambu people "and have avoided playing politics". "If all teams are working for the benefit of Kiambu people we will deliver but now some are playing politics waiting for direction from the governor and we do not know when he will be back."
