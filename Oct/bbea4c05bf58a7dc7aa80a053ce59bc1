KPL's crime was to uphold the ruling by the Sports Disputes Tribunal(SDT) which directed that they increase the composition of teams in the top tier from 16 teams to 18. This forced SuperSport to withdraw their television rights and financial support by SuperSport. In December 2014, SuperSport had renewed their deal with KPL for a period of five years. Football Kenya Federation are keen to take over the running of the top flight league after their contract with KPL comes to an end in September next year. FKF are currently in charge of the National Super League, the women's Premier League and the third tier. According to KPL chairman Ambrose Rachier, the exit of SportPesa who were bankrolling the league body opened them to the possibility of a reunion with SuperSport and they have already tabled a proposal. After SuperSport's exit, KPL entered into six month deal with Bamba Sport valued at approximately Ksh 100.7 million in July 2017. Last year, Spanish based MediaPro was contracted to produce matches but did not have a permanent broadcaster until the start of the new season. “We have been pursuing a possible reunion with SuperSport as our league broadcaster for the second time. We have written to them but we are yet to get a response from them. We are not certain that they will consider the Kenyan market but we are hopeful that they will come back.” SportPesa entered the Kenyan football market in August 2015 as the league's title sponsor after the contract between the latter and East African Breweries expired. The gaming firm stepped up the annual grants by the Breweries from Sh 170 million to approximated Sh360 million. However, a tax hike saw them cancel all their local partnerships in January last year but would return in April the same year albeit with limited funds. In August, KPL and the Kenyan sport was dealt a blow as SportPesa withdrew from the Kenyan market citing unfavourable business environment. The government, through the Betting Control and Licensing Board, had declined to renew their operating license and worse still ordered closure of their pay bill numbers. The stand-off led to SportPesa shutting down their operations in the country.
