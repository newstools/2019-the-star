The Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) has fingered African Youth Games 800m silver medalist Angela Munguti over the use of banned substances. The 18-year old athlete, who was part of the team which represented the country at the Youth Olympics held last year in Argentina, tested positive for a prohibited substance contrary to the Article 2.1 of the Anti-doping code. The code states that an athlete will bear responsibility for any substance entering the body. According to AIU, Munguti's samples were laced with Norandrosterone. “It is each athlete’s personal duty to ensure no prohibited substance enters his or her body. Athletes are responsible for any prohibited substance or its metabolites or markers present in their samples. Accordingly, it is not necessary that intent, fault, negligence or knowing Use on the Athlete’s part to be demonstrated in order to establish an anti-doping rule violation under Article 2.” Munguti, who has a personal best of 2:06.21 joins the growing list of Kenyan athletes busted for use of banned substances. The athlete finished third during the national Under-20 trials held in June 2018, where she clocked 2;08.02. On October 9, another Kenyan Philip Kimutai was suspended after testing positive for Testosterone. Last week, reigning African 10,000m champion Berehanu Tsegu of Ethiopia also fell short of the doping rules. The 20-year-old Tsegu claimed silver during the Copenhagen Half Marathon held last month.]
