A community based organisation has decried poor garbage collection in Nyeri, warning that rivers around the town will be polluted with the onset of the short rains. Chania Water Resources Users Association said garbage was everywhere in the town's streets. They said there is a possibility of an outbreak of waterborne diseases if action is not taken swiftly. The residents spoke during a workshop organised by the NGO Wetlands International in Nyeri on Tuesday. The waste management crisis arose after the dumpsite at the Asian quarter was rehabilitated and the county government embarked on construction of a Sh600 million bus terminus. The town now has no dumpsite. Efforts by the government to get a new site have received opposition from members of the public. Subcounties have rejected plans by the government to dispose garbage in their areas. Residents of Witemere slum in Nyeri town recently teamed up with MP Ngunjiri Wambugu to oppose creation of a garbage site there, saying it will be too close to Chania river and may pollute it. Policy and advocacy officer at Wetlands International Titus Wamae said there seemed to be no solution to the garbage crisis in the town. “We wish to plead with the county government to support WRUA to identify mechanisms for dumping of waste and to support upstream residents to support the ecosystem so as to conserve these rivers for future generations,” he said. Wamae said dumping of garbage everywhere in Nyeri town due to lack of a dumpsite is a critical issue for residents and the environment. WRUA members went to the field to identify issues to include them in a subcatchment management plan. “We have identified several issues and the major ones are encroachment particularly on the wetlands, violation of the riparian zones such as farming and settlements near the river banks and quarrying activities along river banks,” he said. He said if there was no intervention, miners block the rivers with soil and stones.
