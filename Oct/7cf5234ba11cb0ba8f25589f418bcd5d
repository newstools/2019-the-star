Reality TV Star Ella Ciru says her ignorance cost her a baby. Speaking on Nairobi D, she said she was pregnant but did not know up until two months in. “I was on birth control. My man and I were living our best life and there was an injection that did not work,” she said. "Though I do not blame the doctors that gave me the injection. I blame myself. I was not consistent." She said it was hard controlling herself from drinking alcohol, even after she found out she was expectant. “Every time I drunk a shot, I just wanted to puke, and I trust me, I can handle my liquor. When I found out I was pregnant, I couldn’t give up alcohol just like that. I started drinking wine and I got the courage to tell my boyfriend and we were happy about it,” she said.
