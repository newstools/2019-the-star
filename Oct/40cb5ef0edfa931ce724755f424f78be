The Kisii government will allocate funds to protect riparian and water-catchment areas, Governor James Ongwae has said. Speaking to the Star on Friday, he said, “Encroachment in such areas has been rampant. I am not going to allow the same to continue.” He urged the county assembly to quickly pass the supplementary budget to enable him to deliver services. Earlier, Ongwae led a team comprising officers from Nema, Forestry department and Gusii Water and Sanitation Company to fell trees planted along the Nyamokomba river in Kistutu Chache North constituency. The operation came after the Executive Order he issued expired three months ago, which required residents who have planted trees along water-catchment areas to remove them. The decision was arrived at after wide consultation with elected leaders from the region. “I am telling a few of tree owners who have since defied the order that my administration is going to use its own machinery to fell the trees,” Ongwae said. The county boss said his administration has since launched compulsory removal of the eucalyptus trees across the county. “This is aimed at restoring water levels in rivers across the county,” he said. “Environmental conservation is critical for sustainable socio-economic development. This is why we have intensified conservation activities throughout the county.” He said experts have warned the county will soon become water-scarce if residents don’t stop indiscriminate cultivation of eucalyptus trees. The most affected rivers are Nyakomisaro, Nyanchwa and Riana, whose water levels have reduced drastically due to the effects of the trees.
