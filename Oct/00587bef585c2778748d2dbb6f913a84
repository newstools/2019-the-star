The United Nations Office for Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) has warned of a humanitarian crisis in parts of Somalia caused by floods following heavy rains. The agency estimates about 182,000 people have been forced from their homes by the floods. Most of those displaced are from the central Somalia town of Beledweyne. Rescue and relief efforts are under way. A boat carrying at least 30 people capsized on Monday in the town leading to the death of at least 10 people while many others are thought to be missing. Somaliaâ€™s President Mohamed Abdullahi "Farmajo" Mohamed met with members of the recently formed floods relief committee and religious leaders to discuss how to offer aid to the victims. He appealed to the international community to assist those affected by the floods. There is a campaign on social media dubbed #ReliefForBeledweyne appealing for donations for the victims of the floods.
