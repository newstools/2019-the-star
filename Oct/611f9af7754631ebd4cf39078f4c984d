Kenya women's Premier League leaders Gaspo hope to continue their good run as they take on Zetech Sparks today at the Ruiru grounds. Despite starting as favourites, coach Isaac Maluki said he expects a tough match from the much-improved side who have proved to be tough lately. Even though Gaspo are ready for the challenge, their inferior goal difference could prove a stumbling block in their bid for the title. "It won't be an easy match considering Ztech are rising fast. They have made life difficult for top teams in the league despite their mid-table status. I expect a hard match but our aim is to play for three points. The goal difference gives us a low advantage because we have not been ruthless. We will have to collect 12 points from our remaining matches and hope Vihiga Queens slip." Gaspo has 64 points from 24 matches having played two more games than second-placed Vihiga Queens, who could gain a foothold atop the table if they win their weekend assignments. Vihiga host Oserian Ladies at Mumias Sports Complex today as Kisumu All Starlets lie in waiting tomorrow at Moi Stadium. Vihiga Queens have won their last five matches and are tipped to retain the title. Their goal difference of 69 is more than double that of Gaspo 33. Vihiga have 61 points and if both sides win their matches, Vihiga Queens will take the lead on superior goal difference. Manour Agricultural Center will host  Trans Nzoia Falcons matches. They play  Eldoret Falcons and Mathare United Women FC. Eleventh-placed Makolanders have a date with Speedag at Camp Toyoyo.
