Police in Meru have launched a manhunt for a trader who stabbed to death a man at Muriri market in Tigania East. There is still tension at the market as the attacker, identified as Joshua Kileru,  is still on the run. He abandoned his car at Muriri market and started stabbing residents randomly with a knife as they scampered for safety. Tigania East subcounty police commander Peter Karanja said they are pursuing the assailant and have launched investigations into the motive behind the attack. He refuted claims on social media that Kileru killed seven people and injured several others. “We are still pursuing this person since yesterday. We had only one person dead and five injuries contrary to what we are seeing on social media that seven people were killed. Such information is misleading,” Karanja said on the phobe on Tuesday. Samual Gitonga said the assailant is said to have had a quarrel with his family. He had also reportedly recently killed a camel with his vehicle and the owners were demanding compensation. He claimed that the assailant may have been threatened by the owners. He questioned why police took too long to respond while the deputy county commissioner’s offices, the chief officer and a police station are a few meters from where the attack happened. “They could have arrested him as he refilled a motorcycle at a nearby filling station,” he said. “We have not yet arrested him. He is dangerous and still on the loose. We don’t want him to inflict more injuries to the members of the community,” Karanja said.
