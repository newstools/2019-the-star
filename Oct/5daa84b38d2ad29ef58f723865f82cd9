Police in Naivasha have expressed concerns over the rising cases of suicides after two men committed suicide in the town. In the first case, a 65-year-old man hung himself in Kinamba estate in Naivasha after learning that he had an incurable chronic disease. His body was found hanging in his home in the estate located off the Naivasha-Kirima road by his kin before police were called. Police took the body to Naivasha sub-county hospital mortuary. John Mbugua, a witness, said that that the man had been ailing for long and was on and off medication in various hospitals. Mbugua said the family had suffered financially and psychologically because of the man's illness. Elsewhere, a man committed suicide in Karagita estate in Naivasha after learning that his wife had been impregnated by another man. Residents of the sprawling estate were left in shock as police moved in to carry away the body of the flower farm worker following the midday incident. According to a neighbour only identified as Michael, the widow's pregnancy was the main source of conflict in the home. Michael said that the man had on several occasions denied that he was responsible for the pregnancy. “The man had told us that he suspected that the pregnancy belonged to another man,” he said. He told of their shock on learning about the suicide adding that the couple had a two-year-old child who was at home when the incident occurred. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said inquest files had been opened and the bodies taken to the local mortuary. “In the recent past we have recorded several cases of suicides either related to family disputes and depression and the trend is worrying,” he said.
