The Star reported on Friday that a female nominated MCA in Kakamega hit her male colleague with a stick because he publicly called her and many women MCAs prostitutes and said they have no right to contribute to assembly debates. Of course, they have a right. Naturally, we cannot condone physical violence (much as we might have applauded her on in our hearts). However, we do understand that nominated MCA Lillian Osiema — and all nominated women ward reps and women in general — was deeply offended and with good cause. The miserable benighted chauvinist who insulted her is Absalom Wambulwa, who was beaten with a stick and hospitalised. The lout hasn't been reachable -- no wonder, he ought to be deeply ashamed, yet we know many immature men, little boys,  share his outdated beliefs. Osiema was suspended for a year. Wambulwa wasn't disciplined -- but why not, Mr Speaker? Didn't he abuse a member in the assembly? Publicly? What do your fine Standing Orders and code of ethics say about that? Or is it fine with you and all other blind male chauvinists if a male MCA publicly calls a nominated MCA a prostitute? You should suspend Wambulwa for a year and make him apologise. Maybe then Osiema would apologise. Or is it okay in Kakamega to call a woman a prostitute in the 'august' (yours are hardly august) assembly chambers? Didn't he show disrespect to the house and disgrace its good name?. How dare you not discipline him! He's the kind of petulant little boy in short pants you don't want in y our assembly. Kakamega assembly is a House of double standards. By your actions, you have blackened your own name and that of the assembly. Nairobi
