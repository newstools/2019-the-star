Jubilee Candidate MacDonald Mariga has unveiled his Education promise for Kibra residents ahead of the forthcoming by-election. Mariga unveiled the promise after handing mathematical sets and a personalised success cards to all students sitting KCPE and KCSE exams in the constituency. According to the sixpoint education promise, if he sails through, he will within a year establish a public school in every ward. He promises to form a Technical Bursary Committee made up of parents and teachers in each ward to ensure transparent allocation of bursary. “I will actively seek international scholarships to empower our Kibra students,” he said. The six point promise further states that Mariga will build a Kibra Constituency TIVET with students benefiting from the automatic bursaries and helb loans. “I will introduce a Kibra CV bank which will use technology to lobby for jobs for our youth,“ he said. Mariga added, “We shall introduce a school based mentorship programme using Kibra Alumni and their international contacts”. According to him, he will progressively introduce a feeding programme in all the public schools which will be supported by Mariga Foundation. He said Jubilee is already building Tivets in every constituency and thus the residents can be sure that within a year, he will lobby and build a technical school in Kibra. Mariga will on November 7 battle with over 15 candidates to win the Kibra seat. The seat fell vacant after the late Ken Okoth succumbed to cancer. ODM’s Imran Okoth, ANC’s Eliud Owalo and Ford Kenya’s Khamisi Butichi are among top contestants in the by election.
