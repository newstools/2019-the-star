Embattled Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi has been brought back to the assembly by a number of city MCAs from the minority side. The ODM MCAs have closed all the gates barring access into and out of the assembly. Addressing the media, Elachi said that women in the county assembly are tired of intimidation. “I have been the speaker all along and I have come back to bring sanity in the assembly,” she said. Hitting out at the Majority Leader Abdi Guyo, Elachi warned that no leader should touch ODM Party leader Raila Odinga. “You cannot be a leader and abuse the women of the county,” she said. Echoing Elachi's sentiments, Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga said that women will no longer be abused and asked Elachi to put her foot down According to an MCA who sort anonymity, the ODM MCAs had planned Elachi's return, without involving the House leadership. Elachi was last seen in the office last year in September when the MCAs attempted to forcefully remove her from the office.
