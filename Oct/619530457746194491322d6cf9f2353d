Referees welfare, transparency and accountability headlines Charles 'Korea' Omondi's manifesto as he bids to clinch the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Nairobi West top position. Korea lifted the lid on his intention of ousting the incumbent Bashir Hussein in the polls set to be conducted on December 7. The Kenya Police team head coach, who recently guided his men to claim gold in the East African Police games in August, said he opted to trade the coaching role for a management position in a move aimed at salvaging the dwindling football standards in the region. â€œI have been in coaching for long and time is ripe for me to graduate to football management. "Clubs in our region do not have reliable sources of funds yet they are subjected to the burden of paying referees. "If elected, this will be a thing of the past. The biggest challenge we have is transparency and accountability which makes sponsors shy away. "I will work to rectify that by holding an AGM and make records known to all stakeholders in the region. Under my watch, coaches and referees from the region will be trained," he said. .
