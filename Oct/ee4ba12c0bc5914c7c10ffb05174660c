The car that plunged into the Indian Ocean 13 days ago has been retrieved. The car was retrieved on Friday, a few minutes past 4pm. This marked the end to a 13-day search and retrieval mission that begun on September 29. The car plunged into the ocean after it slid off the MV Harambee ferry at the Likoni crossing channel. Government Spokesman Cyrus Oguna said the military will be accorded an opportunity to conduct a brief military service after the retrieval. He said later, police will proceed with the bodies for further processing. “Meanwhile, the family will also be allowed to hold a prayer service at the scene before embarking on burial arrangements," Oguna said. The family representative said the prayers that they have been having at the ocean have been fruitful. “As a family we have waited for a long time that we did not expect. We are grateful to God that at least we got to see the remains of our daughter,” he said. He said they have fully briefed the police where they will drop the bodies once they are through with processing. “We shall be having meetings at Tudour for funeral arrangements,” he said.
