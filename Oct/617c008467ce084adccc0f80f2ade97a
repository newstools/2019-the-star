Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi's administration is putting up stringent measures to curb the sale of alcoholic drinks to minors especially during the holiday session. County Alcoholic Drinks Board CEO Mwaki Arimi urged bar owners to be careful especially during school holidays not sell alcohol to students. He said the board is not issuing new licenses and urged those intending to open a new club to wait until next year. The board's director of licensing and enforcement Akubu Gitonga said the board will start inspecting major towns of Timau, Mikinduri, Maua, Laare and Nkubu by December and proceed to the other markets in January next year with the help of market committees. Gitonga said they have been carrying out impromptu operations in various towns where they have arrested bar owners fro different offences and arraigned them, some being fined up to Sh50, 000. “We want to give a stern warning to people who are operating without a license that we are soon coming for them. We will also not allow second generation and counterfeit liquor to enter the county. We have put measures in place including securing all our borders and entry points,” he said. Arimi cautioned bar owners not to take advantage of the ongoing rains to sell alcohol past the licensed time saying already, some people had been swept by floods after drinking till late. “I want to thank community-based organisations who are working very well with community police makers, chiefs and police to deal with traditional brews that are rampant in the villages and I urge other areas to emulate the same," he said.
