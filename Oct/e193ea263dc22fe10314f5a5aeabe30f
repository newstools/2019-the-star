Debutants Rising Starlets yesterday hammered regulars National Youth Service 38-19 in the ongoing handball league. Coach Andrew Juma alluded that their improved speed contributed to the stellar performance at the Kaloleni grounds. He added that tightening up his defence was a call he had to make against their tall opponents. “Speed was a very strong point on our side. I had my teamwork on it because it was something we lacked in our previous matches and I am glad it paid off since we stayed in the lead from the beginning,” he said. “We had quite tall opponents against my relatively short charges, so we had to tighten the defence. I made sure we marked their best scorer and that also gave us the advantage against them,” observed the tactician. “We were mostly affected by the wet ground in the first half just as we had anticipated. However, we managed to maintain possession with our two-handed short passes,” said Juma, adding that the win is yet another motivation for the young team. “We are new to this league and being able to create such a margin against a seasoned team makes the players have self belief. We are on a learning curve and trying to adapt to some of the tactics we see in other games will help us grow,” Juma concluded. In another match, defending champions Nairobi Water thrashed Mount Kenya University- Thika 44-15.
