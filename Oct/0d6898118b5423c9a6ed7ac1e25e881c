Residents of Njathaini in Roysambu constituency are concerned over the rising number of bodies being dumped in the area. In the last month, eight bodies, including that of a woman, were discovered. The area is seen as a dumpsite for people who have been murdered. Speaking to the Star yesterday, Nyumba Kumi chairman Mwangi Mugo said none of the corpses discovered had bullet wounds. “The place is dangerous because unknown people have been dumping bodies here. The bodies that we found were either found naked or hands tied at the back. The latest male body was discovered on Saturday. His shirt was unbuttoned. He succumbed to strangulation,” Mugo said. Kasarani police boss Peter Kimani did not pick calls or respond to text messages. Residents are appealing to the police to intervene before things get out of hand. Mugo said the land where the bodies are found belongs to "an unknown person". The bodies are taken to the City Mortuary. “If anyone’s relative is missing, I urge them to please pass by the City morgue before they are buried by the Nairobi county government,” he said. The Nairobi county government under the public health department has been trying to get rid of unclaimed bodies to reduce congestion.
