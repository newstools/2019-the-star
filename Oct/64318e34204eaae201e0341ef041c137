As we commemorated World Food Day on October 16, it was vital that we recall the foods our forefathers consumed. Traditional food plays a significant role in maintaining the well-being and good health of an individual. However, the traditional food base and knowledge are being eroded. This has resulted in decreased dietary diversity due to food insecurity and consequently poor health status. Fatal diseases like cancer have found a place to dwell because of unhealthy lifestyles. Therefore, there is need to create awareness on the benefits of traditional food. It is vital to know the importance of good food habits of our own tradition and a balanced diet. For instance, eating a diet enriched with vegetables may reduce risk of stroke, cancer and type 2 diabetes.  Mombasa
