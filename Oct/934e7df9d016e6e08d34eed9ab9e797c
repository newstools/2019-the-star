Kenya Lionesses players have lamented over unpaid allowances and lack of support from the government despite qualification to next year's Tokyo Olympics Games. Speaking on arrival from Tunisia at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA), a bitterLionesses skipper Philadelphia Olando said they have several challenges and some of their players had been locked out by landlords owing to lack of rent in the last couple of months. "We have had several issues to contend with and we are asking our patron and Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed to intervene ad improve our welfare,” she said.  The CS who was expected to receive the girls didn't show up as had been widely expected. Olando said despite the heroic reception at the airport including traditional dancers,  the players were hurting. "It has not been easy and credit must go to the players for putting everything behind them and delivering good results. We have qualified for the Olympic Games which is a big honour not only the players but also for the country,” she added. Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) are still waiting for Sh190 million from the Sports Fund after the budget to cater for the various national teams was approved in July . The money is yet to hit their accounts. Olando said the team need four to five tournaments if they are to medal c at next year's Summer Games in Tokyo. “ We need exposure and if we can get a couple of tournaments under our belt, then we can compete with the top playing nations in the world like New Zealand, Australia, USA or Canada,” she said. Head coach Felix Oloo said playing in Dubai tournament in December will be a good indicator to gauge their strength ahead of the games. “ Dubai will be good as we will be paired with some of the best teams in the world and they will help us see where we can improve,” added Oloo. The team will take a two-week break before resuming training early next month.
