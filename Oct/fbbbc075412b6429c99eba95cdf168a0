Police in Nakuru have arrested a 27-year-old man who exhumed the remains of his father. Patrick Ndonye from Subukia on Wednesday dug his late father’s grave and exhumed the remains of the deceased who was buried in 2014 before the neighbours tipped the police. Nakuru County Police Commander Stephen Matu confirmed the incident, saying that Ndonye had been arrested and detained at Subukia police station. “Neighbours tipped the police on the incident who pounced on the Ndonye and arrested him. He had already exhumed the remains of his father’s body. He claimed he was wanted to collect his father’s shoes which he could later sell and get money for his upkeep,” said Matu on phone. However, the irked neighbours said that Ndonye was exhuming his father’s remains so he could take to a witch doctor to use them in performing rituals to make him rich. “Ndonye was exhuming his father’s remains so he could take his bones to a witch doctor for him to get rich. He started the exhumation exercise at 3am on Monday,” said Kamau Kimani, a neighbour. The neighbours said that Ndonye had exhumed the remains and had managed to secure the bones which he was taking to the witch doctor. The neighbours said that it was the second time Ndonye was attempting to exhume his father’s remains. The police boss said that Ndonye is expected to be arraigned in court immediately the investigations are complete.
