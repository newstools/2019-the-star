Police in Lamu are investigating the suicide death of a 13-year-old boy at his home in Hindi town, Lamu west on Sartuday. The body of Athman Buyo, a Std 5 pupil was found hanging inside his room. It is unclear why he ended his life. The boy's stepmother Saida Jillo said he had locked himself inside his room only for his body to be found by his siblings. “I sent his siblings to check on him after he failed to come for the whole day. They came back screaming saying he was hanging. I went and found he had killed himself using a kikoi,” she said. She said the boy had become withdrawn and cold towards his family but had not had an altercation with anyone. His grandfather Mzee Shiika said he was shocked by the incident which he said was the first in the family. “I don’t know why my grandson decided to take his own life. Nothing like that has happened in our family,” he said. Lamu county commissioner Macharia Irungu said there is a possibility that the boy was depressed but the police would investigate. “Police are investigating the matter but my advice to parents is that they keep a close eye and encourage them to talk about their issues and problems so as to deter things like suicide,” he said.
