A former civic leader has urged people from Central not to join others in criticising former Othaya MP Mary Wambui’s appointment to the National Employment Authority. Former Kaimbaga MCA Kimani Njiraini said people from Central, and especially Nyandarua, should be thankful to the president for appointing Wambui and former Kinangop MP David Ngugi as a member of the Lappset Board. Njiraini said the two appointments, coupled with the earlier appointment of Monica Mucheke as a member of the Insurance Tribunal, show the president loves Nyandarua county. Njiraini said though Wambui comes from Othaya, she has a big farm in Kaimbaga, Ol Kalou, where she has invested heavily in dairy farming and has employed 30 people from Nyandarua. He said people from the Rift Valley, Nyanza, and Western are always thankful when the President appoints people from their regions to serve in different capacities and even organise homecomings to celebrate the achievement. But the Central region only makes noise and joins the social media onslaught against the president and his appointees. Following Wambui’s appointment, Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja demanded that she decline the appointment and vowed to move to court for it to be quashed on grounds that she is not qualified.
