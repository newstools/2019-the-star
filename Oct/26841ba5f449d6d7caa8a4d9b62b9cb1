The number of fatal road crashes in the past nine and half months has exceeded that of a similar period last year by 400, the National Transport and Safety Authority said on Monday. The comparative fatality figures are 2,735 this year and 2,335 last year. The number of pedestrians killed since January was 1,049 compared to 902 recorded last year. Many of them died in hit-and-run incidents. The death toll among motorcyclists was 815, passenger fatalities were 554, drivers (262) and pedal cyclists 55. The figures for last year were 623 motorcyclists, 529 passengers, 239 drivers and 42 pedal cyclists. NTSA attributes 98.07 per cent of road crashes to human error, 1.93 per cent mechanical and none to road infrastructure. Nairobi leads in road crashes with 344 cases, followed by Nakuru at 223, Murang'a at 187 and Makueni at 168. Last year, 273 black spots across the country were identified by the transport authority, 199 of them in the Northern Corridor and 74 in Nairobi. The number of Public Service Vehicles involved in accidents this year has reduced to 415 from last year's 433. The report says privately-owned vehicles were the most involved in road crashes with 722 incidents, commercial vehicles at 630 and motorcycles at 559. Last year, privately owned vehicles involved in accidents were 599, commercial vehicles (573) and motorcycles (377). NTSA also indicates in the report that the non-visibility period between 5pm and 7:59am accounts for 69 per cent of the road crashes while the visibility period of 7:59am and 4:59pm accounts for 31 per cent. In contribution to fatalities by gender, 83.3 per cent of fatalities are male while 16.7 per cent are females. So far, 2,263 males have been in accidents since January compared to 459 females. Over the same period last year, males involved in crashes were 1,927 while females were 406. Edited by R.Wamochie
