The national government ordered 120 families to vacate Suba region forests in 60 days, by December 1. Or face eviction. The aim is to preserve ecosystems and conserve water catchment areas destroyed by settlers. The notice covers households living in Gwassi and Rangwa forests. They have not vacated protected lands despite earlier orders. Homa Bay county commissioner Herman Shambi and ecosystem conservator Mathews Ogutu said on Thursday the families encroached on protected land and are destroying the environment. “There is a clear demarcation between private and forested lands. Let the families abide by the order and leave before the deadline to avoid eviction,” Shambi said. Gwassi and Rangwa forests are water catchment areas like Kodera, Wire, Lambwe Forest and Homa Hills. Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Shambi accused the families of damaging he environment by settling on preserved lands. The ecosystem is threatened by reckless logging and agriculture. “Human activities in forested areas have reduced forest cover in Homa Bay to less than three per cent," the commissioner said. Ogutu said the government will not compensate residents who unlawfully settled in preserved areas. According to Ogutu, more than 500 hectares are occupied by families in Gwassi. The forest covers 4,835 hectares (1,947 acres). “The ejection process will be systematic and orderly to avoid conflicts or damage to property,” he said. The officials said settlement in the forest promotes soil erosion causing floods in lower areas of Suba South. Logging has shifted and reduced the flow of 20 streams, Ogutu said. Gwassi Forest is on a steep hill. When people cultivate their farms, topsoil is eroded and washed to lower areas. "This promotes flooding and mudslides that cause deaths and property damage in the lower forest," the conservator said. Restoration of the forest will enable people living in lower areas to get water from rivers whose sources are within Gwassi Forest. (Edited by V. Graham)
