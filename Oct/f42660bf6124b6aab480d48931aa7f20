Lamu leaders are unhappy that President Uhuru Kenyatta did not pick a replacement for the late Public Works PS Mariam El Maawy from the area. She was born in Lamu. El Maawy died in September 2017 at a South African hospital while undergoing treatment for injuries sustained during an al Shabaab attack in Milihoi on the Lamu-Mpeketoni road on July 13 that same year. Her niece and four bodyguards also died in the attack. Milihoi is a notorious terror hotspot on the Lamu-Garsen road where hordes of security officers and civilians have lost their lives. Shortly after her death, Prof Paul Maringa was appointed to fill the position in an acting capacity before Gordon Kihalangwa took over the docket as PS. On Thursday, Lamu leaders led by Lamu East MP Athman Shariff, MCAs and the council of elders said they felt cheated that the President left out Lamu when picking El Maawy replacement. Shariff said the move was a slap in the face considering that Lamu has been supporting the Jubilee government. The legislator said the move shows that Lamu is still marginalised. “El Maawy was our only person up there. Unlike other counties that have hundreds of people holding state appointments, we only had her, and we feel the president arm-twisted us by failing to appoint one of our own to replace her. There needs to be a balance. For our support, a single state appointment would have been a welcome reward,” Shariff said. Lamu assembly majority leader Abdalla Baabad said it was unfair that some counties had numerous people holding state offices, while Lamu had none. "In the many state boards for various projects, there isn't asingle person from Lamu. The most shocking is that even the Lapsset board of which Lamu is the host doesn’t have a single person from here. We are demanding to be included in the government. This marginalisation must end,” Baabad said. Lamu elder Mohamed Abubakar said the PS died while on an official engagement, but the government has forgotten about her.
