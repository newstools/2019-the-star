World record holder Eliud Kipchoge has requested former US President Barrack Obama for a meeting. This is after Obama congratulated Kipchoge and Kenya's Brigid Kosgei for being remarkable examples of humanity. In a tweet on Monday, Obama said both Kipchoge and Kosgei are remarkable examples of humanity with an ability to endure. Kipchoge became the first human to finish a 42km marathon in under two hours. Eliud completed the Ineos marathon on Saturday, clocking the line at 1:59:40:02. Kosgei finished the Chicago women's Marathon at 2:14:04.Brigid broke a world record that had stood for 16 years, held by British athlete Paula Radcliffe. Appreciating Obama's recognition, Kipchoge tweeted back to Obama. Obama himself was a face of hope and breaking of barriers when he ran for US President in 2008 and emerged victorious. With the slogan: Yes we can, Obama inspired the world to believe in their dreams and goals. He became the first black President of the US. Obama was also the first black President of the Harvard Law Review. Obama, the son of a Kenyan father and American mother shared his triumph over adversity in his best-selling books, Dreams from my fatherÂ and The audacity of hope. In a bid to find out about his background, Obama visited Kenya as a young man in 1987.
