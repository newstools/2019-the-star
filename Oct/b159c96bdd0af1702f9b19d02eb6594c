Former Deputy Auditor General Stephen Kinuthia and his sons were on Wednesday released on bail by the Anti-Corruption Court. Chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti ordered Kinuthia to deposit a Sh10 million bail or an alternative Sh30 million bond. His sons Desmond Kinuthia and Nelson Kinuthia were also released on a Sh5 million and Sh3 million bail respectively. They were also directed to deposit their passports in court and not to interfere with witnesses in the case. The case will be mentioned on November 7 for further directions. They were charged on Tuesday alongside 11 others in relation to irregular procurement of audit software. They are accused of buying an audit vault software at Sh100,675,680 against its estimated cost. Charles Njuguna, an advocate of the High Court, was also charged. They denied the charges before Ogoti. The DPP, however, did not oppose bail but urged the court to issue stringent terms commensurate to the charges and money lost. The prosecution also asked for the court to order that they should not access their offices or contact any of the prosecution witnesses. The defence lawyers told the court to take into account that the eleventh accused, Nelson, is sick. The court was told that Kinuthia has TB. His lawyer claimed Kinuthia was conducting his normal affairs when the transactions were carried out and "only received remittances in his client account which was disbursed in accordance with his briefs".
