The Busia County Assembly will debate the Punguza Mizigo on Monday when they will adopt or reject the bill to cut costs. The Bill by Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot seeks to reduce the cost of government, reduce the number of MPs from 416 to 147 and make each county a single constituency, among other measures. Speaker Bernard Wamalwa requested MCAs to dispose of the Bill before it's forwarded to the National Assembly by October 16. The debate on the bill follows public participation from September 23 to 26. Nine assemblies have rejected the bill, including Siaya, West Pokot, Homa Bay, Nyamira, Kiambu, Murang'a, Nairobi and Kisii. Uasin Gishu has passed it. The bill requires the endorsement of at least 24 county assemblies for it to pass the threshold for a Parliament vote. Aukot was in Busia on September 11 to drum up support for the bill.
