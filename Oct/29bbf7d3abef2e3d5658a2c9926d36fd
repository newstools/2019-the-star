Equity has unveiled a new identity in line with its journey of transformation and regional expansion. The new identity is aimed at creating sustainable growth path and service delivery. Going forward, Equity will present itself as a unified brand, with one basket of products and services under one roof; ranging from banking to insurance and investment. The new logo now features “Equity” without an entity name such as Group, Bank,Insurance, or Investment Bank. Equity Group CEO James Mwangi noted that the refreshed positioning follows an extensive three-year process of sounding out its current and future customer segments. “The evolution of our brand is an important part of our strategy for continued marketl eadership as well as being integral to the promise we made to all of our stakeholders when we began our journey of transformation to modernize and do all we can to get closer to andbetter serve our customers,” he said.
