The burial service for Mariam Kigenda and her four year daughter Amanda Mutheu is currently underway. Kigenda and Amanda died at the Likoni crossing channel after their car slid off a ferry and plunged 58 meters deep into the sea. The incident happened on September 29 but their bodies were retrieved 13 days later after long hours of search. The two will be laid to rest today in Mung'ala village, Kilome constituency, Makueni County. The motorcade and hearse carrying the remains of the two victims left Mombasa at midnight and arrived at AIC Kima church ground at 9:30 am on Saturday. Sombre mood engulfed Mung’ala village as the motorcade that included Nairobi Governor's Mike Sonko rescue team arrived at the church ground where the burial service is to take place. There was a brief silence as the caskets containing the remains of the two were being removed from the hearse. The silence was broken by a voice of a woman who was wailing uncontrollably amidst mourners who had arrived. Makueni  Governor Kivutha Kibwana and senator Mutula Kilonzo junior are also among the hundreds of mourners present. Others expected in the burial are Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia,  Governors Mike Sonko (Nairobi) and Hassan Joho (Mombasa). The tragedy has seen Lawmakers push for the punishment of  Kenya Ferry Services and Kenya Coast Guard managers. The legislators also  want Kenya Defence Forces to take disciplinary action against the Kenya Navy "personnel who did nothing despite being metres from the site of the incident." The 11 MPs regretted that the agencies failed to save the mother and her four-year-old child. So far President Uhuru Kenyatta has revoked the appointment of Kenya Ferry Services board members. In a special Gazette notice dated October 16, Uhuru fired chairman Dan Mwazo and members Daula Omar, Naima Amir, Philip Ndolo and Rosina Mruttu. The revocation takes effect immediately.
