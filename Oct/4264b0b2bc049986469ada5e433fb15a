Two schools in Turkana have been closed indefinitely after floods destroyed buildings, equipment and learning materials. Director of Education in Turkana county Peter Magiri ordered the closure of schools affected by floods after assessing the damage caused by the floods. They are St Kevin’s Secondary Lodwar and Erait Academy Primary. Last week on Friday, heavy rains caused rivers to burst their banks and displaced people living along the river line and lowlands. Three people and more than 3,000 shoats were killed. “The rains we experienced last week have caused a lot of damage to our schools. School buildings, including classes, were swept by floodwater that destroyed laboratory equipment, exam materials, school materials and food,” he said. He said students of St.Kevin’s Secondary Lodwar have been sent home as they repair classes and toilets. Thomas Lokuruka, the Principal of St Kevin’s Secondary School, said they have incurred heavy losses, and they have been forced to close the institution before sitting the end term examinations. “Our school was ravaged by floodwater, that didn’t spare buildings. We opted to close the school immediately until the situation is improved,” he said. He said Form 4 candidates have also been asked to go home as the school management, partners and the county government seeks a solution so that candidates can resume for the preparations of their exams. Lokuruka appealed to well-wishers to help the school get laboratory equipment, food and rebuild the classes.
