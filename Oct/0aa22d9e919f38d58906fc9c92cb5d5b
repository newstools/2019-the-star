Likoni ferry operations have been suspended for between 30 minutes to an hour. The move is meant to give rescuers ample time to retrieve the wreckage of a vehicle that plunged into the Indian Ocean on Sunday with two occupants onboard. Kenya Ferry Services Managing Director Bakari Gowa says the wreckage is believed to be 173m deep. "This is to notify ferry users that due to the ongoing exercise of retrieving the sunken vehicle we are likely to experience delays between 30 minutes to one hour as ferry movement is affected," Kenya Ferry Managing Director Bakari Gowa said. A team from Kemfri, KFS, Kenya Navy, Sonko Rescue, KPA and KMA are currently at the site. The occupants, a mother and her four-year-old daughter were coming from a shamba trip in Kwale. The two were identified as Mariam Kighenda, 35, and Amanda Mutheu. Their car, a Toyota ISIS KCB 289C, veered off the rear ramp aboard the MV Harambee and sank into the ocean headfirst.
