Embattled Kisumu county speaker Onyango Oloo has suffered a setback after the High Court dismissed an application seeking to suspend search warrants issued by a magistrate court. Oloo had challenged the search before he was charged with fraud and the searches were conducted in his homes, including Kisumu Mamboleo and Syokimau. Justice Mumbi Ngugi, in her ruling on Wednesday, said that the warrants issued were not overboard in scope and it did not lack factual foundations. While dismissing the application by Oloo, judge Ngugi noted that the search of his residences was within the law. Oloo had also challenged his removal in court. In an application filed under a certificate of urgency, Oloo said there were irregularities in his removal and the court should reinstate him pending the hearing and determination of the case. The county assembly and the county assembly service board are respondents in the suit. Acting speaker Elisha Oraro and two others are listed as interested parties. In the impeachment motion last month, MCAs cited an active corruption investigation at the Lake Basin Development Authority against the speaker. The ward reps urged the speaker to resign until the probe is completed. Oloo claims that his replacement by Oraro contravened the provisions of Article 178 (1) of the Constitution. Oloo is also fighting to have all the benefits, allowances and privileges he enjoyed as the speaker of the county assembly reinstated to him.
