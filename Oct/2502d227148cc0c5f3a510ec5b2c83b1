Nyamira governor John Nyagarama and his Kisii counterpart James Ongwae have been challenged to improve sports facilities in the devolved units. Gusii Sports Legends director Alfred Momanyi regretted that sports facilities in the two counties are in a pathetic state. He, however, welcomed to the improvement of Gusii Stadium in Kisii. “It is disheartening that in the whole of Nyamira County, we don’t have an athletics track. The county government should build at least four stadiums with athletics tracks at Manga, Ensoko, Nyamaiya and Magwagwa areas,” added Momanyi, who is currently based in the US. Momanyi, the former Athletica Kenya (AK) Nyamira chairman and founder of Mwanyagetinge Athletics Club which produced top athletes, challenged the two governors to allocate substantial amounts of funds for sports development. He further noted that athletics standards in the country have dwindled in the two counties. Momanyi called for the establishment of more athletics camps to nurture upcoming athletes. “We used to dominate athletics in the country. The two counties and other stakeholders should come together to revive athletics,” added Momanyi. He said the region has produced top athletes among them Olympic gold medalists the late Naftali Temu, the late Robert Ouko, Charles Asati and Hezekiel Nyamao. “We want to return to our glory days and that is why as legends, we have come together to promote athletics. However, county governments should support this endeavour,” Momanyi added.
