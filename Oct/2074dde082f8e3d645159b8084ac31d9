Breastfeeding candidates must be given full support during the ongoing KCPE examination, the Kajiado East assistant county commissioner has said. On Wednesday, Boniface Mwenda allowed a 12-year-old candidate to breasfeed her son between exams. Naisenya Tayakwet, the 62-year-old grandmother, walks 32 kilometers every day to bring the baby to her mother for breastfeeding. A well-wisher in the remote area has offered the woman, her grand-daughter and her great-grandchild a place to stay near the exam centre. “The grandmother’s passion to see her grandchild continue her education is what has captured our attention. I felt it is only fair that we support the two. She is a bright girl who has been scoring high marks in her class,” Mwenda said. A total of 1,088, 987 candidates sat for their exams on Tuesday. Exams end  Thursday with  Social Studies and Christian Religious Education papers.
