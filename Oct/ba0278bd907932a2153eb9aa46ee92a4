Two primary schools in Laikipia East subcounty were on Monday closed and another given one week to comply with regulations or face a similar fate. The operation was led by Laikipia East deputy county commissioner Esther Dhahabu and local education officials. They revoked the registration of Ephma Academy in Timau and Bridge International School in Likii. The pupils were ordered to be absorbed in nearby public schools. Spring Fair Academy was given a one-week ultimatum to renovate and expand classrooms in the school’s tiny compound. The owners should relocate a kitchen that is adjacent to classrooms to avert a disaster in case of fire. Dhahabu said the move was prompted by the directive from the Ministry of Education that the safety of learners should be ensured in all schools. “We would not want to get an incident where a learner is injured or dies while at a learning institution and that’s why we’re enforcing the directive to the full,” the DCC said. Laikipia East subcounty director of education Kimathi Kiara said Ephma Academy had 130 learners among them 21 KCPE candidates. The private day and boarding primary school had dilapidated structures for classrooms and a dormitory, lacked good latrines and all 11 teachers were not registered by the Teachers Service Commission. The education officials said they had discovered ECDE pupils and those in grades one, two and three had been combined in one class and taught by a single teacher. At Bridge International with a population of 88 pupils, the officials noted the institution lacked adequate space for classrooms and a playground. It stood on a quarter-acre, the classrooms were dilapidated and lacked windows and proper doors. The school was not registered.
