Nairobi county assembly speaker Beatrice Elachi has recommended disciplinary action against Jubilee MCAs who disrupted the plenary session on Tuesday. Elachi said the names of the ward reps will be forwarded to the Jubilee Party Disciplinary Board. On Tuesday afternoon, a section of Jubilee MCAs refused to take their seats as they chanted that the speaker should respect a court order barring her from presiding over sittings until a motion to remove her is debated. â€œI will forward the names of the members involved to the party for disciplinary action. It is unfortunate that members from our majority party have given us quorum only to entertain us through songs. When we had a meeting with the party we agreed to follow all rules and procedures of the House," Elachi said. The MCAs chanted for almost 15 minutes before walking out of the chamber when Elachi started the day's business. The Jubilee MCAs said they obtained court orders on October 25 barring the speaker from presiding over the sittings of the county assembly and/or its committees pending the determination of her impeachment. The court order further prevents the city assembly, Public Service Board and assembly clerk Jacob Ngwele from bringing in strangers to the House and anybody who may interrupt its business.
