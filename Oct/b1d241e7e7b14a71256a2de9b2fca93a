Four-time New York City Marathon will be chasing her fifth title when this year's edition go down in the American city next week. The former world half marathon champion will be hoping to become the first woman to win the race on five occasions and currently holds the record for most wins alongside Norwegian Grete Waitz. Keitany, a two-time London Marathon winner, also holds the fastest time in the event's history at 2:22:48, clocked while winning last year's event. As she intensifies her training in Iten, Keitany said she is not leaving anything to chance as she wants to make history in the USA on  November 3. “My training is going on well in readiness to defend my title and make history. I have been performing well in training and I wish to replicate the same when the competition time comes,” said Keitany, a former world half marathon champion. Keitany has won in New York four times in the last five years. She won the title in 2014, 2015 and 2016 editions in 2:25:07, 2:24:25 and 2:24:26, lost to Shalane Flanagan in 2017 before recapturing it last year. Despite heavy rain pounding in the region, hindering part of her training programme, Keitany is optimistic of great results. “I have not faced many challenges despite too much rain on the training course but that will not stop my ambitions for the title,” added Keitany. In 2017, the mother of two ran the women’s only world marathon record after winning London marathon in 2:17:01. Apart from chasing the title, she will also be chasing her third Abbott World Marathon Majors following her victory in 2012 and 2016. She will face compatriot Vivian Cheruiyot, who won 2018 London Marathon title. Others include Worknesh Degefa, Ruti Aga and world half marathon record holder Joyciline Jepkosgei.
