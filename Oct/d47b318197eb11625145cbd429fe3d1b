Even before the dates and procedure for the Football Kenya Federation national elections have been formally released, interested parties are leaving nothing to chance to ensure the polls are free and fair. In the wake of allegations that the current FKF leadership is plotting to lock out sub-branches from taking part in the elections by delaying their grassroots voting to a date after the national and branch polls, FKF Nyamira sub-branch official Jared Nyauma has moved to the Sports Dispute Tribunal to have the allegations addressed. “On October 1,  I sued Football Kenya Federation on behalf of the FKF Sub Branches on the matter of FKF Electoral Code 2019 which excludes the FKF Sub Branches from participating in the forthcoming FKF elections. The Sports Disputes Tribunal Court through its wisdom certified the petition urgent and ordered for inter-parties hearing on October 4 at the Sports Tribunal Chambers at 11:30 am,” read Nyauma’s statement to media houses. Former FKF President Sam Nyamweya was the first to blow the whistle on the alleged plot to disenfranchise the sub-branches. Nyamweya alleged last weekend that he had noticed a plan by the Football Kenya Federation to lock out sub-branches from participating in the forthcoming elections. “According to the federation national office, the sub-branches will hold their elections after the branch and national officials have been elected. I find this to be a total infringement of the rights of sub-branches to deny them the opportunity to be part of the exercise,” observed Nyamweya. Now it is up to the SDT to prove the veracity or otherwise of the serious charges being levelled against the current office if only to safeguard the integrity and sanctity of the elections.
