Girls at Enkare Ngiro Primary School have received more than 1,000 sanitary towels from the Narok Tannery and Leather Factory workers. The act of charity was part of the celebrations of the International Day of the Girl Child which was held on Friday. Factory director Joel Mwato said that their aim was to ensure that all the girls continue to stay in schools even during their menstrual cycle. “Studies have shown that girls from poor families miss classes due to lack of sanitary towels,” Mwato said. Narok Tannery and Leather Factory is under Ewaso Ngiro South Development Authority. The director said sanitary towels are a basic need for schoolgirls and the assumption that every girl is capable of meeting this need is wrong. “Our visit is a chance to give back to the society by distributing sanitary towels during this eventful day of the girl child,” he added. Factory chairperson Ann Ngugi said that the girl child, especially in areas such as Narok where cultural norms tend to withhold their potential, does not have access to such basics. “Girls in Narok especially those in the interior regions are neglected and find it hard to access sanitary towels yet it is a basic need to them one they hit puberty,” she added.
