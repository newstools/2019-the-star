Academy Award-winning actress Lupita Nyong’o has joined Watch Hunger Stop, a global philanthropic campaign against hunger. The initiative started by Michael Kors is in its seventh year. It supports the United Nations World Food Programme and its school meals programme. The campaign has helped WFP deliver more than 18 million meals to children since its inception. Speaking about her new role Lupita said, “I am proud to support Watch Hunger Stop because it focuses attention on solutions to the problem of hunger and encourages people to take action on an individual basis. “Watch Hunger Stop helps to fund meals for schools, which has a direct impact on levelling the performance playing field for underprivileged students.” She said when a student is fed he or she focuses on her education, hence, her involvement in the project. “When students can eat, they can perform better in school, which in turn leads to greater opportunities in life,” Lupita said. “In so doing, Michael Kors and WFP are facilitating better opportunities for women and girls daily.” Kors announced that this year’s theme for Watch Hunger Stop is ‘Food is Love’. The American designer said profits from T-Shirts will be donated to the project. “For every unisex LOVE T-Shirt and tote sold, Michael Kors will donate 100% of profits to the @WorldFoodProgramme,” Kors wrote on social media. “We’ll also donate 100 meals for each customer who posts a selfie wearing their shirt or tote and tags #WatchHungerStop.”
