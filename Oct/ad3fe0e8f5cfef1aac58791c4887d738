A six-year-old child drowned on Monday while swimming in a dam abandoned by a Chinese contractor in Mumbira village in Budalangi constituency, Busia county. Lydia Oundo, the mother of the Chrispinus Dibo, a pre-unit pupil at Sibuka primary school said she did not find her son at home when she returned from the hospital. Her neighbours informed her that he had gone swimming in one of the dams abandoned Syno-Hydro Construction Company with four other children. The Chinese contractor had been scooping murram in the area for rehabilitating the northern dyke along River Nzoia. Oundo said she rushed to the dams and found four young boys standing by the banks.  They told her Dibo had remained inside one of the deep dams. “I sought assistance from a herder who was looking after his livestock nearby after finding my son's clothes at the edge of the dam,” she said. The body was retrieved by the boy's father Michael Omanyo and later taken to Port Victoria hospital mortuary by the police.
