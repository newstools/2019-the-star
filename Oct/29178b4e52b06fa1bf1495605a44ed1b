The Kielelo Ziwani women dancers from Kariokor, danced their way to Makadara for the Mashujaa Day celebrations. The elderly women have been singing and dancing Kilume traditional dance since the 1990s, and have performed for prominent leaders. These include former US President Barack Obama during his visit to Kenya in 2015. This gained them recognition from State House and were awarded withs uniforms, which they named the Obama Uniforms. Chairperson Teresia Nzola told the Star their hard work and endless trainingÂ  sessions have earned them stipends for dance performances at State House. She organises every performance. She "We train every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Our unique dance moves have gotten us invitations to dance for President Uhuru, and we've been able to get some earnings from this" she said. Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko promised them a vehicle and a business that will help them grow financially. The vehicle will assist them during their trips locally during various dance performances. They call each other family and during their free time, they educate the youth on safe sex awareness on voluntary basis.
