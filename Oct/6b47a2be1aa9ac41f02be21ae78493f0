The Kisumu county assembly on Tuesday rejected  the Punguza Mizigo Bill as the deadline for the debate looms. The motion to debate the Bill was moved by Kolwa East MCA Steve Owiti, who urged members to reject the Bill, which he termed retrogressive. Owiti faulted Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot, the drafter of the Bill, for failing to involve the public and elected leaders. "The amendment to change the Constitution should not be a one person’s agenda but should be people driven," he said. The assembly Majority Leader, Kenneth Onyango, brought to the attention of the House a meeting they had as the County Assemblies Forum that unanimously passed to have the Bill defeated. Onyango said the Bill if enacted will derail the gains already made in the country through the new Constitution. "We made gains with devolved system of governance that must be safeguarded," he said. Onyango cited the positions of women, which he said the Bill intends to reduce after efforts to fight for their positions. All the MCAs who debated opposed  the Bill, which they said would drag the country back. Others asked why Aukot did not seize the opportunity to give his views to the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) on how best the Constitution should be amended.
