Emotions ran high on Saturday at Kibelgor village in Konoin as the body of a student whose body was found at the shores of the beach in Mombasa last week was laid to rest. Caleb Kiplangat, a first-year student who was barely two months at the Technical University of Mombasa, was found floating at the shores of Junda beach in Mishomoroni in Kisauni hours after he went missing. Several leaders and mourners expressed their dissatisfaction with the manner in which police had carried out their investigations into the cause of his death. Postmortem reports showed Kiplangat died of asphyxia, which is a result of lack of oxygen due to drowning. Led by Bomet Senator Christopher Lang'at, Woman Representative Joyce Korir and MCA Robert Serbai, the leaders accused the police of doing a shoddy job, with the family insisting it was not a case of drowning as stated by the investigating officers. "This boy has never been suicidal and never lacked anything in his life... We will not accept the theory given to us by the police that it was a suicide case," Joshua Rono, the family spokesman, said. He added that a few days before Kiplangat went missing, he had called his mother to let her know that the holiday would be brief and hence may not see the need of coming home hence invited her to visit him in Mombasa. Korir urged Interior CS Fred Matiang'i to act swiftly and help the family get answers and justice on what happened. "We want to see justice being served to the family...some things do not add up in this death. There could a foul play in this case," she said. The deceased was a mechanical engineering student and he went missing on October 14 and was found dead four hours later.
