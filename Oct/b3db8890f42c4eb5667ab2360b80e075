Manvir Baryan, Carl “Flash’ Tundo and leader Baldev Chager will be the drivers to watch in the forthcoming KCB Guru Nanak Rally slated for Lukenya on October 20. Chager, who leads the log with 123 points against Tundo’s 96, hopes to widen his lead in an event that will count towards the sixth leg of the Kenya National Rally Championship (KNRC). The 'Flying Singh' first won the Sikh Union-organised round in 2004 navigated by the late Farakh Yusuf in a Subaru. He returns behind the wheels of his traditional Mitsubishi Lancer Evo10 hoping to beat the Skoda Fabia R5’s of Manvir Baryan and VW Polo R5 Onkar Rai. The Skoda Fabia R5s have proven performance on short flat out stretches while Evo drivers savoured quite a fast drive in the long endurance setting of Nanyuki stages. Chager will also be driving aggressively to vanquish Tundo’s Evo 10 which swept the ground with all and sundry in Nanyuki Rally last month. Manvir who has dominated the season with the Skoda better known as ‘The Rat’ has been the driver to beat and compelled the Evos to drive at 110 per cent. “The boys are burning the midnight oil getting the cars ready but we have faith in them and they will have it all sorted by then,” said Chager who is teaming up with Ravi Soni. While Chager will be going for his third career Guru Nanak victory, Flash will be looking to seal his maiden hat-trick on the event and indeed his sixth in one of Kenya’s most prestigious rounds in the eight led series championship.
