Each week, Songa awards fans with smartphones for simply listening to the songs. There are over 2 million songs to listen to and the best part is that celebrities have created their own playlists. Last week, tens of fans won themselves free smartphones through listening to playlists by Classic 105's Maina kageni, Mike Mondo, Terry Muikamba, Kiss 100's Kamene Goro, Andrew Kibe and many other celebrities. Brian Chege, head of content acquisition and A&R, said last week that, "The more you listen, the higher your chances to win a smartphone. First download the Songa app, listen to our 2.5 million+ songs and also various playlists."
