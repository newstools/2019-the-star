A family in Wambwe village Mathioya, Murang’a county, woke up to the shocking sight of two crosses erected outside their houses. Unknown people had also deposited human waste around the houses. Priscilla Nyakiiga said she saw the two crosses immediately she stepped out of her house on Monday morning. One bore the name of an in-law who passed away a while ago while the other was blank. Nyakiiga said the incident was shocking and the family was still wondering what the intention of the perpetrators was. Grace Wambui, a neighbour, said such a thing had never been experienced in the area before. Wambui asked police to investigate and establish who was behind the incident and their motives, saying it could mean the family was in danger. Assistant county commissioner Fabian Wambua said administrators accompanied by security officers visited the home and arranged to have the crosses removed. The crosses were removed by religious leaders from the area after conducting prayers. Wambua said police were pursuing several leads but no arrests had been made. “We have suspects in mind whom we think could be behind it but investigations have not yet been concluded,” he said.Wambua said the family had been experiencing constant domestic squabbles over land.
