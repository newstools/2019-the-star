The meteorological department on Friday raised an alarm over heavy rains expected across the country. The department said rains recorded to be over 20mm, likely to be accompanied by strong winds, will be experienced up to Monday. The weatherman said high rainfall intensity will hit Northeastern, Central and Coastal regions. Counties in the Highlands West of Rift Valley, Central Rift Valley, Lake Victoria Basin, East of the Rift Valley, Coastal strip, Northeastern, Southeastern and the counties in the Northwestern parts of the country will receive heavy rains. The weatherman urged Kenyans in the mentioned parts to be on the lookout for potential flash floods. "Floodwaters may suddenly appear, even in places where it has not rained heavily and even may appear deeper and faster than it may look," the weatherman said. The residents have been asked to avoid driving through or walking in moving water as well as to avoid shelter under trees and near grilled windows in order to minimise exposure to lightning strikes. The heavy rains, which are beingÂ  experienced in many parts of the country, killed more than 1,000 goats in Mandera last week. The goats, which had survived a long drought, were killed by a downpour and heavy flooding in Gither ward of Mandera West subcounty. The county government and the National Drought Management Authority have been giving relief rations and trucking in water during the dry spell. MCA Ahmed Rashid said, "It is a very unfortunate incident as the goats were very weak and could not survive the heavy downfall."
