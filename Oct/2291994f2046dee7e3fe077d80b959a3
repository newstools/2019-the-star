Kenya Breweries Limited on Friday launched a new Guinness variant, Hop House 13, at Karen Waterfront mall Nairobi. Hop House 13, a premium, international quality lager, will be rolled out across the country later this year. It is a flavour lager from the House of Guinness available across Europe, with Kenya being the first market in Africa to launch it. KBL marketing manager Nduku Wamakau said, "Hop House 13 will tap into all senses of our consumers, allowing them to experience the excitement about this new lager from Guinness."
