 Some Mungai Primary School pupils in Gatei, Gatundu North, learn under trees after some of their classrooms developed huge cracks on the walls and floor. Parents say they do not want to take chances with their Standard 7 children following last week's tragedy at Precious Talents School in Nairobi where eight pupils perished and 60 others were injured. Those who spoke to the press said that their pleas to the school management to have the classrooms either repaired or their children moved to other classrooms have fallen on deaf ears. They are worried that their children will fall sick due to the cold in the area. The learners are also unlikely to concentrate on their studies. “The situation is getting worse and it’s obvious their academic performance will decline. We even don’t know whether they are being taught,” a parent who sought anonymity said. Ng’ang’a Mwaura, another parent said, “The classrooms are a disaster in waiting. They are no longer safe for use. We are hoping a solution will be found to end the suffering to our children.” Recently, two lavatories caved in and those still standing are dilapidated and unhygienic. The headteacher was uncooperative when journalists contacted her. Parents called on the government to save the situation before tragedy strikes. Area MP Wanjiku Kibe said by phone that she is aware of the situation and that her office will repair the classrooms. Wanjiku said the school has been allocated Sh4.6 million in the 2018/2019 financial year. “Funds are available and rehabilitation will begin very soon. The NG-CDF will renovate the school,” the MP said.
