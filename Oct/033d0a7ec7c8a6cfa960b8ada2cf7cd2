The Kenya National Union of Teachers secretary general Wilson Sossion has suspended its Annual Delegates Conference set for December. The meeting sought to among other things iron out the leadership wrangles in the union and fill in the vacant positions. It is at this meeting that KNUT delegates were to either reaffirm their confidence to the contested secretary general Wilson Sossion or vote him out. Sossion in September survived a battle to oust him from the union spokesperson position. A brief ejection of the SG from a section of the union's supreme organ was overturned by the labour court to reinstate Sossion as the union's SG. However, those against the SG sought to use the meeting as a channel to try and get a vote of no confidence in the SG to have a change of guard. To end the hostilities, the union on Thursday sought the help of COTU to iron out the leadership feuds and re-conciliate the top union heads. COTU secretary general Francis Atwoli spearheaded the Wednesday reconciliation meeting. KNUT chairperson Wycliffe Omucheyi and deputy secretary general Hesbon Otieno were absent at the arbitrationÂ  meeting. Omucheyi is battling for his survival in the union over retirement age. "It is practically impossible to have the ADC in December as requested by a section of our branch members. We, therefore, postpone the ADC indefinitely," Sossion said. The venue of the conference was set for Kakamega and would bring together 1877 delegates representing the former eight regions. The eight regions to be brought in this year's ADC will involve Central, Coast, Eastern, Nairobi, North Eastern, Nyanza, Rift Valley and Western. Broken down, Central has 211 delegates, Coast 139, Eastern 392, Nairobi 43, North Eastern 24, Nyanza 327, Rift Valley 503 and Western 238.
