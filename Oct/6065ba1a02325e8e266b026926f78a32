There was pomp and colour in Watamu as more than 200 athletes, both national and international champions, took part in the annual sports festival over the weekend aimed at promoting tourism in the resort town. Sports involved included cross triathlon, aquathlon, duathlon and aquabike and wife carrying. Winners got varied awards from the organisers from Sh10,000 to Sh3,000. Most hotels were fully booked with the majority of local tourists who had flocked to watch the multi-sports and enjoy the long weekend in the resort town. There was a lot of fun, entertainment as the events unfolded in the better part of both Saturday and Sunday. ENDS
