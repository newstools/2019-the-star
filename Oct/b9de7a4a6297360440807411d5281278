World cross country junior champion Beatrice Chebet will be the star attraction during the Isaiah Kiplagat Memorial Ndalat Gaa cross country championships in Nandi County on Saturday. Beatrice will be seeking to take over the title from her elder sister Sandrafelis Chebet, who won the title in 2018. Sandra will be chasing New Delhi Half Marathon this weekend in India and in her absence, Beatrice will start as favourite in the 10km women’s race after graduating to seniors mid this year. Beatrice won the 6km junior title last year and will be seeking to emulate her elder sister when she lines up in the 10km race. Beatrice has featured at various Diamond League Series races and will be yearning to win her first title in the senior cadre. Beatrice's coach at Lemotit Training Camp, Paul Kemei, believes she has what it takes to fit well in her sister’s shoes come Saturday. “We are anxious to see her perform in the senior cadre. She has done well in senior races and she believes she can extend the same in the senior women’s race,” said Kemei. Beatrice will be joined by team-mates Caren and Emily Chebet in 10km while Mercy Chepkorir, Deborah Chemutai, Sharon Chepkemei, Sharon Chepkurui and Ann Naasiho will feature in the junior 6km race. Meanwhile, the event organisers expect world marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge to grace the occasion. Kipchoge is still fresh from breaking the sub-two-hour mark in Austria and remains the talk of the town. “As the race ambassador, we expect him to be in attendance and to encourage young athletes. As you well know that Ndalat is all about discovering, nurturing and tapping young talents,” said Mutai.
