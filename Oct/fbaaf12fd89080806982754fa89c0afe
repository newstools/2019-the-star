Talismanic Kenya Sevens star Collins Injera will miss the Olympic qualifier in South Africa next month due to a shoulder injury sustained during the Safari Sevens tournament 10 days ago. However, Injera, Kenya's top try scorer in the World Sevens Series, is expected to be fit for the 2019/20 Sevens Series opener in Dubai in early December and the second leg in Cape Town a week later. At the Series, Shujaa will need Injera's experience and playmaking ability as they face three-time series champions South Africa, England and Spain in Dubai. Team manager Eric Ogweno said the boys are in good shape for the qualifiers in South Africa following a successful Safari Sevens outing, coupled with a solid pre-season. "As opposed to last year, we have had eight weeks of pre-season training and the boys are in good shape. Playing at the Safari Sevens helped with the combinations which augur well for a long season ahead,” said Ogweno. Ogweno predicted a tricky Olympic qualifiers outing with Zimbabwe and Uganda potential challengers. "Every team wants to go the Olympics so it will be a battle in which we cannot take any team for granted. The nature of Sevens is very unpredictable and we must be at our best,” added Ogweno. "The spirit and mood in the team is good and the players can't wait for the qualifiers, to test ourselves against the best teams on the continent." Shujaa, alongside South Africa, represented the continent at the Rio Olympics in 2016. The team will be named next week with Shujaa departing for South Africa on November 6. The team that finishes second and third in the qualifiers will head for the repechage next year in June with other regional qualifiers across the globe.
