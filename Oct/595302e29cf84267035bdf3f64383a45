Police have launched a manhunt for young men who raped five schoolgirls in Narok South subcounty. County commissioner Samuel Kimiti said that the Standard 8 girls from Naroosoora were ambushed by a group of young men who defiled them in turns. They had just left a pastor’s house on the eve of Mashujaa Day accompanied by a teacher when they were attacked. “I have directed the area deputy county commissioner to launch a manhunt for the young men so that they are brought to book,” Kimiti told journalists in his office. He condemned the crime and banned schoolchildren from attending any night vigils in the county in order to safeguard their safety “It is not that we are against night prayers, but when it involves our school children the matter is not negotiable especially during this examination period,” he said. The administrator warned the Maasai morans against hiding behind culture to commit crimes. He urged the chiefs and other leaders in the county to guide and mentor them. Last week, three morans were arraigned in Narok and charged with defilement of a 13-year old girl.
