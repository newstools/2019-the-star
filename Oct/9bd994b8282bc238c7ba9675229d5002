KCB RFC will draw inspiration in their quest to retain the Kenya Cup gong from their superb Floodit exploits which saw them win their third Cup in a row over the weekend. The bankers saw off Menengai Oilers 23-14 in a match played at Impala Club. They had also won the 2017 and 2018 editions. It was their second time to win the tournament in three successive editions after laying hands on the trophy in 2013, 2014 and 2015. The Ruaraka-based outfit won the 2005 and 2007 finals. However, it is worth noting that Oilers gave a good account of themselves as they eased to the final on their debut. According to KCB's skipper Curtis Lilako, the win was a perfect curtain-raiser to the new season set to kick off on October 6. “Floodies is always like a warm-up for the Kenya Cup, the upcoming 15's season. It was not an easy game and we are seeing new names making every year more competitive. Retaining the title was a morale booster for the team.” Homeboyz finished third, beating Kenya Harlequin 30-5 while Impala beat Nondies 17-15 to win Plate. Strathmore Leos claimed the universities title after downing Mean Machine 26-16. In the women’s category, Black Lions won 40-5 against Black panthers.
