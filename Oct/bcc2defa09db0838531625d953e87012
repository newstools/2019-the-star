The Kwale County government has denied wasting more than Sh53 million on unsuccessful education projects. In 2014, the county enrolled some 68 talented students under the educational scholarship to India. It was later alleged that the programme had stalled. Some leaders said that after five years there is not much to show about the programme and students are still languishing in unemployment. Speaking yesterday during the swearing-in ceremony of the new Public Service Board members, Governor Salim Mvurya said his government made prudent use of the funds and no single penny was lost. Mvurya said his administration promised to empower and transform the lives of the youth through education, but did not vow to offer jobs to specific people. “We did not sign any formal agreement that we will give students employment immediately they graduate, this was meant to give them learning opportunities,” said the governor. He added that the funds were used to only sponsor the Kwale natives and not people from outside the region as being alleged by critics. “It is shocking for Kwale residents to say that I squandered the resources, yet these are your own children and not foreigners,” he said. Mvurya said there is no harm in assisting young generation to accomplish their dreams. He said in some years to come, the same people will run the county because at a point in life were they equipped with the desired expertise. He said the achievement he has made towards education is provable and viable. “What I have done is remarkable. Instead of gossiping and speaking nonsense, why don’t you come and seek records because the idea is valid,” he said.
