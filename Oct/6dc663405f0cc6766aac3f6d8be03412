Bomet county and the Kenya Red Cross will set up a disaster response centre for the South Rift Valley. Governor Hillary Barchok said it will greatly help in coordinating and controlling response in Bomet, Kericho and elsewhere. He said a committee looking into disaster response will hand over its report this week. Barchok said the land has been set aside for the Red Cross to put up the centre. He spoke at Chemaner in Bomet East during a fundraiser for traders whose premises were destroyed by fire a month ago. “We have to be well prepared in case of such calamities…we do not want to be caught unawares," Barchok said. The South Rift Disaster Response Centre will respond to fires, floods, drownings, need for ambulance services and other problems. The centre will help save lives and property since the reporting centre will operate 24-7, information will be recorded and communicated swiftly for action. A lot of property has been lost of the years due to lack of preparation, even after an alarm has been raised. The county has state-of the-art fire engines and four ambulances leased from the Red Cross. (Edited by V. Graham)
