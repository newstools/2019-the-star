Diamond Platnumz's videographer Lukamba says of the numerous rumours spread by people about his boss, the most hurting one was when the WCB singer was accused of taking drugs. Speaking to Bongo 5 over the weekend, he said, "I really hated it when people started linking him to drugs. It hurt me because I knew it wasn't true. I have never seen him use those things. He has never even held bhang in his fingers." Lukamba said since Diamond discovered him, he has lived with WCB like family "I am proud to live with people of love, they are charming and supportive. If and when I get out, I will miss the unity I've had over there," he said. Talking about Diamond's women, he said Zari was the one who was difficult to work with. "Zari used to like photos a lot, very early in the morning when it's too cold," he said. "Tanasha is okay. She is a woman who understands herself. She has given birth and has kept silent because she is peaceful and a drama-free woman and talks to everyone."
