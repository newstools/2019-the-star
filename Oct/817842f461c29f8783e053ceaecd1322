Vihiga United coach Sammy Okoth has hailed his side for coming through a tough derby against new boys Vihiga Bullets and claim their fourth win of the National Super League season and remain within touching distance of the second automatic promotion slot. “It was a difficult match against a team that is determined to show they have what it takes to compete at this level,” said Okoth. “The win was very important for us because the teams above us are not going to drop many points so we have to ensure that we match them game by game.” Vihiga are solely focused on returning to the top tier league after their relegation last season and Okoth reiterated they will leave nothing to chance to go back to topflight football. “My players believe we have enough experience to return to the KPL. They must now turn that belief into strong performances in each and every game. It is a long season and many things can happen but so far we are on the right track,” he finished. Vihiga, with 19 points, are fifth in the standings after 10 rounds. Nairobi City Stars maintained their place at the top following a 2-1 win over Fortune Sacco at the Hope Center. This was City Stars’ ninth win out of 10 games, in which they have amassed 28 points, six clear of second-placed Bidco United, who beat Shabana 2-1 at the Thika Stadium. Nairobi Stima also managed a 1-0 win away to Muranga Seal and is ranked third with 20 points. Surprise package Migori Youth are fourth on the table after their goalless draw at home to Ushuru.
