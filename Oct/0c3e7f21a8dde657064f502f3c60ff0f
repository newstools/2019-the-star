Twitter Inc said that the social media website and its dashboard management platform TweetDeck was hit with an outage, with thousands of global users left in the dark. While the company has said it's aware of issues and investigating, problems have also hit regular users, who aren't seeing new DMs at the moment, or may have trouble adding extra stuff to tweets like images, videos and polls. While it hasn’t given any details as to what caused the global outage, there are more than 4,000 reports of the incident globally from Japan, Canada and India that have been reported by outage monitoring website Outage.report. A Twitter representative had earlier said that the company was investigating issues with TweetDeck, primarily used by journalists, media houses and other content creators for monitoring tweets from multiple Twitter accounts. Log in attempts by users of TweetDeck seemed to be redirecting users to Twitter’s website. In a tweet,the company said it’s working on a fix and that things "should be back to normal soon."
