The planned countrywide recruitment of soldiers has been cancelled. The cancellation came a day after MPs summoned Defence CS Raychelle Omamo to explain how the recruitment would be conducted and whether it will be free and transparent. The recruitment was to start on October 28. Katoo ole Metito, the chairman of National Assembly's Defence and Foreign Relations Committee, told the House yesterday that his office had received a letter indicating that the exercise had been put on hold. “We have been informed that the exercise would be conducted at later dates, which will be announced by the ministry,” he said. MPs were concerned that many youths would be locked out if the recruitment was conducted at the county headquarters and not at subcounty centres. Omamo was to explain to the committee the issues that informed the decision to conduct the exercise at the county level. The legislators said many youths, especially those from marginalised areas, would have been disadvantaged as some may not have bus fares to the county centres. The committee was also to question the CS on the steps she has taken to ensure that the exercise will be fair and transparent. Turkana North MP Christopher Doye questioned whether the ministry was targeting a particular group. MPs further wanted to know the total number of recruits to be hired and the figure per constituency as well as positions reserved for each gender. Shariff Athman of Lamu East said not everybody would have made it to the county centres. John Mbadi of Suba South said the ministry must demonstrate that the drive will be transparent. Samburu South MP Alois Toimange said measures should also be put in place to address situations where heavy rains would disrupt the recruitment. "In some counties, there are torrential rains and if the exercise must be done on the said dates, people will be locked out.”
