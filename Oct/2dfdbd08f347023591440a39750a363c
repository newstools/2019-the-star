Activities at Thogoto Village in Kikuyu Constituency almost came to a standstill on Thursday afternoon after decaying meat from eight cows was discovered hidden inside a house. The house is about 500  meters from Dagoretti slaughter house. Police were called in and arrested the house tenant who had stashed the meat. The farm owner, Wairegi Njire, said the his son, who lives and work in Mombasa, was the landlord. "I heard a lorry at around 2am being offloaded. I could not imagine it was such a cargo. We live in the same compound," he said. "What made we me discover everything was not okey, is when I heard the tenant being confronted by my other son, asking him why he had brought a huge amount of meat in the house," Njire added. A resident, Monica Njeri, said people started going to Njire's home, when the tenant left for shopping. "When we came and saw the meat and the smell it was producing, we called the police who came very fast and arrested the tenant," she said. Thogoto chief Richard Kariuki said police established that eight cows were slaughtered at an unknown place, and the meat brought to the house under unclear circumstances. The suspect alleged that someone had bought the cows from a farm in Gatundu South near President Uhuru Kenyatta’s home after they were affected by the strong winds which blew across the country on Tuesday. "We do not want to believe in the suspect's theory, but the police are investigating to establish if there were people who had made report of cows stolen, who authorised them to be slaughtered and the motive of them being locked inside a house," he said. Kariuki also confirmed that police seized the lorry that brought the meat as they pursue other suspects. The Kenya Society for the Protection and Care for Animals took the meat for inspection and disposal.
