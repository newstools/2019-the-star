Kenya Power has issued a 14-day notice to companies and individuals illegally stringing telecommunications cables on electricity distribution poles to offer internet and communication services to households and businesses. These activities constitute a breach of Kenya Powerâ€™s way leave trace and safety clearances, the company said. "In some parts of the country, these illegal activities have caused fires that have damaged third party property," a statement read. The power company states that there has also been an increase in cases of injuries and fatalities recorded involving third party personnel operating in close contact with live power lines as a result of the encroachment. "In addition, these activities have led to disruptions in power supply, resulting in energy, financial and infrastructural losses to the company," the company said. Statistics from Kenya Power indicate that vandalism, meter tampering and power theft through illegal connections are costing the company Sh500 million in losses every year. Molo Sucounty has registered the highest number of vandalism incidents of Kenya Power's installations in Nakuru, the power distributor said. Kenya Power Central Rift regional manager Engineer Kipkemoi Kibias said vandals are making it hard for the power utility firm to help make the county a 24-hour economy. Speaking in Molo Subcounty when the County Development Implementation Coordination Committee inspected various state-funded projects Kibias said vandals were targeting street lights, transformers, bulbs and other electric parts for sale to unscrupulous scrap metal dealers. The regional manager however said cases of vandalism had significantly dropped after Kenya Power stepped up efforts to combat destruction of its infrastructure through cooperation with police and other investigative agencies.
