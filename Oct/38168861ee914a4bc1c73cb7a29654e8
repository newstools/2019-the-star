A second-half masterclass from Posta Rangers earned them a barely believable 3-0 win against new boys Kisumu All Stars in a Kenyan Premier League match played yesterday. After a goalless first half, the mailmen turned on the style to claim their second win of the campaign and leaving coach Sammy Omollo purring. “I am delighted with the result. I told my players at  half time that if we play the way we played in the opening 45 minutes, then we would lose the game. We then made tactical changes by bringing on Danson Kago and our attacking play improved and we got our goals and went on to win comfortably,” said Omollo. William Odera, skipper Joseph Mbugi and Elvis Osok were on target for Rangers. The victory saw Posta climb an astonishing seven places to lie sixth on the standings with eight points. Omollo touted their new-found solidity to increased competition for places in the squad. “We have very young players who are showing they can cut it at this level and they have made everybody work hard to keep his place. As a coach it makes me very happy to know I have a deep pool of reliable players to choose from. For example, Kago was playing his first match for the season and he came on and changed the game. Such instances make me very proud.” Omollo enthused. The title-winning coach was brought to Posta in the early weeks of the season after they had survived relegation through the playoffs and he suggested that a change in attitude has been key to his sides improved fortunes. “I wanted my players to believe in themselves and enjoy their football.There is a lot of positivity in the squad and long may it continue.” Omollo concluded. For vanquished All Stars,its yet another futile weekend with another trip to the drawing board inevitable. Henry Omino’s debutants have yet to win a match in five attempts and lie second from bottom with one point with winless Chemelil Sugar the only team below them.
