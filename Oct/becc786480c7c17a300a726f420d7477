While the long awaited Jesus Is King album came out on 25th October 2019, the first sales figures demonstrate the enthusiasm generated by the project. Kanye West is definitely an artiste apart. If he has been widely criticized in recent years for his positions in favor of Donald Trump, the rapper, born in Chicago, could have had a commercial fiasco with his new album, Jesus Is King. A project obviously eagerly anticipated by his audience and his wife Kim Kardashian had announced more than a month ago without it coming out, provoking the anger of his fans. The first results seem to confirm the enormous success of this album. It had already accumulated nearly 38 million plays on Spotify, just 12 hours after its release, establishing in passing a new record over such a short period of time. Kanye West also has 9 titles in the Top 10 most listened tracks across the Atlantic. This just implies how impatient his listeners are. According to many US media, Jesus Is King could finally run to 275,000 albums sold in a week, which would allow the rapper to exceed Taylor Swift's 240,000.
