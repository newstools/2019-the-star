Youth advocates Alice Salaita, 16, from Kajiado county and Virginia Muthoni, 18, a peer educator under the Young Health Programme in Kibra, took over the roles of Swedish Ambassador Anna Jardfelt and Canadian High Commissioner Lisa Stadelbauer for a day. They chaired meetings and addressed staff in a programme by Plan International called ‘Girls Take Over’ designed to give young girls a platform to occupy spaces where they can be seen, heard and empowered in leadership roles and carrer choices.
