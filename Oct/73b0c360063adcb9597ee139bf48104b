Likuyani residents should be wary of fraudsters masquerading as Deputy President William Ruto’s allies to fleece them of their money. A group of conmen and women has been asking constituents to form groups and pay a certain amount of money purportedly for processing of grants, Likuyani Deputy County Commissioner Wilson Kimaiyo said. They claim that the grants will be presented to them during an unspecified event at the DP’s Sugoi home in Uasin Gishu, Kimaiyo said at Soy Sambu Primary School on Monday. “My office isn’t aware of such a programme because if it were there it is my office should be coordinating,” he said. The administrator asked chiefs and their assistants to inform their subjects that there was no such programme. Anybody claiming there was such grant should be reported to the police, the DCC said. Kimaiyo was at the same time concerned by the spate of rapes and murders in the sub-county in the last one month. Four women have been raped and killed in a span of three weeks.
