Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa has dismissed reports she is backing ODM aspirant Imram Okoth for the Kibra by-election. Jumwa told the Star that ODM leader Raila Odinga went into her office unannounced and introduced Imram to her. The Malindi MP went on to say she didn't know who Imran was. "I was not even aware of ODM having a meeting. Raila invited me to greet Imran and I accompanied him. I didn't even know him. That is all and whatever is being spun is not true," Jumwa told the Star. This is after ODM head of communications, Philip Etale, in a Facebook post, said Jumwa had ditched Deputy President William Ruto in favour of ODM leader Raila Odinga. He wrote, "Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa today officially ditched Team Tangatanga. She attended the party Parliamentary Group meeting at County Hall..." Raila had a meeting with ODM Members of Parliament, where he introduced them to Imram. Jumwa endorsed Jubilee candidate McDonald Mariga during an Inua Mama rally last week. The group is allied to Ruto. Jumwa on Friday urged women leaders to rally behind Mariga and called for Jubilee nominated MP Maina Kamanda's resignation for backing Imran. Jumwa's support for Ruto is what led her to being expelled from ODM in January. However, she appealed the decision at the Political Parties Tribunal and the expulsion was suspended. Since then, she has continued to accompany the DP during his tours of the Coast. Ruto returned the favour, criticising ODM party leader Raila Odinga for allowing Jumwa's expulsion. In a tweet, the DP accused Raila of double speak and hypocrisy in the manner the party handled Jumwa's matter. "You who've masqueraded as a champion of women, now in your true colours expel a woman elected in her own right after defeating men and blackmail her to kneel and worship you as an "apology." Crime? associating with elected DP of the GoK you have "handshake" with. Tragically deceitful," the tweet read.
