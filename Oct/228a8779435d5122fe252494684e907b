Two directors have been charged in a Mombasa law court over Sh.740 million tax evasion. Abdisalam Abdullahi Gedi and Yahye Elias Bare, who are rice importers, appeared before Chief Magistrate Edna Nyaloti, facing three counts of making incorrect statements, affecting tax liability. This was part of KRA's renewed war against tax evasion. The charge stated that on June 30th 2014, jointly with others not before court, made an incorrect statement in their firm, Liban Trading Limitedâ€™s income tax return for the year of income 2013, as nil returns. They were instead supposed to pay almost Sh.330 million. The second charge stated that on June 30th, 2015, they incorrectly reported their total purchase for the year of income 2014, as Sh.0, as opposed to Sh.146,281,440 million. The third count was that they evaded tax amounting to Sh.264 million on or about June 2016. Another co-accused, Mohamed Hassan Ali, was not present in court when the charges were read against the duo. The prosecution asked court to issue summons against him. The duo were alleged to have been filling nil returns and not the correct amount, thus unlawfully reducing the company's tax. Their lawyer, Jared Magolo told the court the accused persons had been presented before the police and were released on a cash bail of Sh50,000 each. "The charges were known and that's why they appeared in court today," Magolo said. However, Magolo told the court that he had initially applied for a lenient cash bail of Sh. 20,000 and the court should rely on the amount so that his clients can be released. The court declined to grant him the application sought, noting that the weight of the allegations did not qualify for such lenient bond terms. Moses Ado, KRA prosecutor, requested the court be guided by the law while issuing the bond terms. The magistrate directed that the duo be released on a surety bond of Sh.10 million or a a cash bail of Sh.3 million. The case will be mentioned on 8th November 2019.
