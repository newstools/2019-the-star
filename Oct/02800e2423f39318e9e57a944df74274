A case in which businessman Ben Gethi and five former IEBC employees are charged with conspiracy to defraud Sh105 million by altering tender documents resumes on Monday. The case is scheduled to proceed before trial magistrate Lawrence Mugambi of the Anti-Corruption Court. Gethi is charged alongside businesswoman Joyce Makena and Adan Adano, Kennedy Ochae, Abdi Etema Ali, Gabriel Ngonyo Mutunga and Willie Gachanja Kimanga; former staff of the Independent Election and Boundaries Commission. All of them have since denied charges of altering tender documents and forgery. According to the prosecution, Gethiâ€“a director of Solarmak Technologies Ltd, had submitted a bid for a tender to supply lanterns to be used in the March 2013 general elections. It is said that the company was to supply the lanterns for Sh127 million while a competing company, Konnexions Systems Ltd, had offered to provide the lamps for Sh107 million. The prosecution alleges that Solarmak's tender documents were later altered to read Sh105 million. The former IEBC employees are accused of conspiring to commit a felony by altering the substance of a tender document to favour Solarmak Technologies. Mutunga and Kimanga have since denied charges of failing to protect the tender documents while Gethi has denied charges of forging a registration certificate for Solarmak. He is also accused of forging a tax compliance certificate from the Kenya Revenue Authority. Edited by R.Wamochie
