ODM leaders are currently holed in a meeting with the three IEBC commissioners at Anniversary Towers. The ODM team is demanding to be provided with a register of all voters in Kibra ahead of the November 7 by-election. Leaders in the closed-door meeting include ODM chairman John Mbadi, Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna, Florence Mutua (Busia woman representative), MPs Babu Owino (Embakasi East), TJ Kajwang' (Ruaraka) and Executive Director Oduor Ong'wen. IEBC communication manager Tabitha Mutemi earlier told journalists that the commissioners will address a press conference after meeting with the opposition leaders. On Tuesday, ODM accused the electoral body of manipulating the Kibra voters register to rig out Imran Okoth. ODM had threatened to hold the demo in order to demand IEBC to publicly release the full register. The party said it wants a full list of voters sinceÂ 2017, including the dates and centres of registration. The ODM Director of Elections and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed said the unwillingness by the IEBC to release the list makes the party doubt the credibility of the upcoming by-election. Chebukati on Wednesday, however, assured the public that the register will be ready on time before November 7 when the by-election will be conducted. The IEBC boss said they had received 377 new voters by 2019. In 2017, the number of Kibra voters was 118,276. The current number stands at 118,609. "The Commission has from today (Tuesday) posted the changes to the Kibra voters register detailed above in the Constituency Returning Officer's office for seven (7) days inspection and verification," he said.
