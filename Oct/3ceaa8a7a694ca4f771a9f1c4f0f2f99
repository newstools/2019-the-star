A civil society group has demanded an apology from Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong for allegedly using abusive language and being disrespectful. If he fails to apologise, the group said it will take action against him. The Movement for Political Decolonisation in Busia, led by Peter Odima said on Thursday that Ojaamong should humble himself and offer good leadership. Ojaamong recently slammed those who criticise his leadership, saying they have eyes but cannot see what his government is doing. "It is even written in the Bible that they will have eyes but will not see, ears but will not hear. I think the Bible was referring to these busybodies in Busia who walk around in funerals criticising my leadership. Can't they see the development that has come under my tenure?" Ojaamong asked. He spoke during a function at the Kenya Medical Training College in Busia. Ojaamong said Busia residents started using tarmac roads after devolution. Martin Adungosi, the chairman of anti-corruption investigations agency, urged DCI George Kinoti to investigate companies contracted by the Busia government. "We call upon the Noordin Haji-led Office of the DPP and DCI Kinoti to conduct a lifestyle audit of all Busia county workers who were employed from 2013 to 2019. We want to clean up Busia," Adungosi said. They also demanded that the county produce status reports of its projects, including factories that were constructed but have never been equipped. The Sh3.3 billion Everest Juice factory launched by Governor Sospeter Ojaamong in Ikapolok is not operational. The same applies to the Sh10 million cassava factory in Teso South. The factory was expected to serve 15,000 cassava farmers in Busia, Bungoma and Siaya counties. Another stalled project is an organic fertiliser factory built by Korangol, a South Korean company. Erick Otieno, a member of the group, said, "Ever since the finance offices were torched, not a single leader starting from the governor or MCA has talked."
