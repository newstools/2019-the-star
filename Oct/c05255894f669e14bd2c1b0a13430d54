A youth organisation at the coast wants the government to establish a blue economy Presidential Scholarship Fund to educate aspiring seafarers. According to Jumuiya Common Front for Development (JCFD), there are still bottlenecks in the sector despite developments that have greatly improved the investment environment. “The inauguration of the Bandari Maritime Academy is a significant milestone to build required human capital, however many youth at the Coast will continue to miss out due to lack of college fees,” chairman  Dimka Matano said. He said that youth completing basic seafaring courses are often still required to gain extra industry-specific competencies to qualify for the various jobs in the maritime industry, and these are costly. “Having a basic seafarer qualification is not the end of it, youthful seafarers are required to do safety courses, hospitality courses or gain other industry-specific qualifications and many of them cannot afford,” he said. “It can cost over Sh100,000 to acquire a seaman’s book and travel documents, for example, to enable qualified young seafarers access international jobs, and that is a nightmare for many,” Matano added. Three months ago President Uhuru Kenyatta commissioned the rebranded Bandari Maritime Academy in Mombasa to foster the growing demand for seafarers. The government hoped to bridge the huge shortage of qualified seafarers in Kenya and the region to meet the needs of the emerging blue economy sector. (Edited by V. Graham)
