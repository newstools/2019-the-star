A fatal head on collision involving a personal car and a Menya Sacco Matatu left one dead and nine others are fighting for their lives at Meru Level 5 Hospital. The Nyambene Level 4 Hospital nurse in charge of Maternal and Child Health Services (MCH) department Silas Mugambi, succumbed to injuries after his car collided with a matatu along the Meru-Maua Highway. Confirming the incident, North Imenti sub county police boss Robinson Mboloi told the Star Mugambi succumbed to injuries while receiving treatment at Meru Level 5 Hospital. Mboloi said the Menya Toyota matatu driver was avoiding potholes on the slippery road due to mud in some sections of it when the driver hit the private vehicle. “The fatal accident happened at Kaithe on the Meru-Maua road where KCF 823W Toyota matatu belonging to Menya Sacco drove by Dominic Kathurima 36, with passengers collided head on with oncoming car KAW 889C driven by Silas Mugambi upon reaching the accident scene. Occupants suffered injuries. Mugambi succumbed to injuries,” Mboloi said. Mboloi warned drivers to exercise extra caution and drive in a limited speed that they can easily control their vehicle. Nyambene Level 5 Hospital in charge, Githu Wachira told the Star they were shocked to learn that one of their staff had died through the accident. “It is a gloomy day for us in the hospital. Those who worked with him including patients are quite affected but we are encouraging ourselves,” Wachira said by phone on Wednesday. Wachira said that Mugambi had asked for permission for an appointment with a doctor at Meru town. He said Mugambi was a committed, hardworking and very dedicated staff who energy was used to serve patients especially the children and pregnant mothers. “He was one of the best staff in this facility. We are saddened by his demise. We condole with the family,” Wachira said.
