Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji wants more prosecutors to obtain more convictions. Haji said on Tuesday that a greater budget allocation should be considered to facilitate the hiring of new prosecutors across the country. The office of the DPP, Haji said, requires between 1,500 and 2,000 prosecutors to ensure quality prosecution. Currently, he said, there are only 900 prosecutors countrywide faced by an "overwhelming" number of cases. He spoke during the launch of the DPP's  Nyanza regional office. His office will push for increased budget allocation and negotiate to be allowed to hire more prosecutors, the DPP said. This, he said, will be undertaken in phases," he said. He assured Kenyans that his office is committed to effective services despite limited resources. Haji said the war on corruption as not slowed down, emphasising that the focus is on quality, not quantity. “Our objective is to have prosecutions with sufficient evidence in courts. This will enable Kenyans to get justice,” he said. Haji said his office is working on high profile cases that will soon be prosecuted. He unveiled a model Kisumu office equipped with a pre-trial conference room, central intake registry, resource centre and a nursing room, among others. “The model office will eventually be replicated across the country to ensure effective services," the DPP said. Haji expressed confidence that the recently launched Plea Bargaining and Diversion Policy and Guidelines will facilitate quick disposal of cases and reduce prison crowding. High-profile individuals and banks have approached his office since the launch of plea bargaining and diversion policy, Haji said. (Edited by R. Wamochie)
