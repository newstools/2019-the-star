Detectives have begun investigations into the ferry tragedy in which a woman and her daughter died in their family car that sank into the Indian Ocean. Their car was retrieved on Friday with the bodies of Mariam Kaghenda and Amanda Mutheu, 13 days after it plunged into the ocean. On Sunday, Likoni police boss Benjamin Rotich said five people had recorded statements over the tragedy that led to a public outcry over the poor state of the ferries. "We have questioned five people and the probe will continue," he said. Among those questioned are a coxswain, two ferry staff who help to direct vehicles inside the ferry and two guards from a private security firm. It's not clear whether the five were questioned on Friday or Saturday. Speaking last week during the recovery process, government spokesman Cyrus Oguna told the Star investigations would kick off after the car and bodies were retrieved. "If the reports after investigations show that the accident was out of laziness, then we will take action. For now it is an accident," Oguna said. Kenya Ferry Services MD Bakari Gowa dismissed reports that he had been summoned to record a statement but welcomed the investigations. "If the DCI will come, let them come. We are here," he said on phone on Sunday. Rotich said Gowa would be questioned "if need be" adding that "he will come but as of now we have not reached that stage." Bodies of Kaghenda and Mutheu will undergo a postmortem at Coast General Hospital Mortuary on Monday. On Saturday, Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana visited the family at their home in Tudor. He called on the national government to improve security at the crossing channel. The family comes from Kiima Kiu, Kathonzweni ward, Makueni. Edited by R.Wamochie
