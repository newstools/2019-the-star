Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took to Twitter on Saturday to wish her husband, and former US President Bill, a happy anniversary. Hillary posted a photo of her and Bill embracing and captioned it, "Forty-four years later, and he still cleans up pretty well. Happy anniversary, Bill!" The couple has weathered many storms in their marriage to emerge victorious, the most scandalous one being the Monica Lewinsky saga. Last month, Hillary the former US Secretary of State, accused President Donald Trump of putting his personal and political gain ahead of the national interest. In a speech at Georgetown University in Washington, she described his phone call with the Ukrainian leader as a "cheap extortion racket". Trump faces impeachment proceedingsÂ for urging Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, his main rival for the presidency. The president has dismissed them as a "witch hunt".
