Garissa can maximise the use of River Tana to solve its water problems, Moroccan ambassador to Kenya  El Mokhtar Ghambou has said. Ghambou said that like Garissa, Morocco is semi-arid but it is water self-sufficient and the county could learn from their water management practices. The envoy spoke in Garissa on Friday when he paid a courtesy call to Governor Ali Korane at his office. He said River Tana, that flows for over 400km in Garissa, is key to agricultural growth to feed residents with a surplus sold in local and international markets. “People of Garissa have every reason to thank God for River Tana. If its water is put into good use, it can be of extreme benefit to the residents,” he said. The ambassador said Morocco was ‘more than willing' to offer the necessary support, expertise and experience to Garissa when called upon. Ghambou said that Morocco was ready to work with Kenya in the fight against terrorism. Governor Korane said that Garissa and Morroco share many things in common and hence the need for greater collaboration for mutual benefit. He said Garissa had a thriving livestock industry that needed to be tapped through the establishment of a meat processing plant via private-public partnerships. Deputy governor Abdi Dagane conducted the envoy on a tour of the main water intake plant along the banks of River Tana, the water treatment plant, Maendeleo Farm in Sankuri ward and to gypsum extraction sites. Present during the meeting were county secretary Abdi Ali, and county executives Issa Oyow (Water)  Issa Yarrow (Agriculture), Habiba Nasib (Education), Roble Nuno (Finance) and Abdi Omar (Roads).
