There was a scare on the MV Harambee ferry in Likoni after a male passenger's phone battery burst into flames. The incident happened when the passenger tried to open the phone cover. The passenger who sustained minor injuries reportedly threw his phone in the water. "Police are investigating the incident that took place at 9 am," Kenya Ferry services said via Twitter on Tuesday. More than 300,000 people and 6,000 vehicles cross the Likoni ferry channel every day but a look at history paints a picture of a death-trap. The Likoni ferry, which started operations in 1937, serves Mombasa from the Island to the mainland side of Likoni on the Kilindini Harbour.
