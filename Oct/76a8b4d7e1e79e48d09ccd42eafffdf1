 Wajir Governor Mohamed on Wednesday made a mini- reshuffle in his executive to further improve services. A letter seen by the Star, signed by the county secretary Abdullahi Maalim and copied to the governor, states that the changes take immediate effect. Abdihakim Billow Noor who was the Health executive and acting Finance chif has been named full-time Finance and Economic Planning boss. Ismael Issack has been moved from Trade to head the Health docket. Yussuf Abdi Gedi from Agriculture and Livestock has moved to trade while Ahmed Bashir has been moved from Public Service to Agriculture. Ahmed Guhad Omar, former Chief officer of medical services, moves to the Water Department, while Yussuf Dayib has been transferred from Water to Public Works and housing. Khalif Abdi, who was the chief officer for Irrigation, will be acting Town Administrator. Abdullahi Mohamed will remain as chief officer for Public Health and become acting Medical Services director. â€œThe handing and taking over should be done and reports submitted with immediate effect and latest by Monday, October 14. The County Secretary shall preside," the letter reads. On Sunday while speaking in Giriftu, Wajir West, the governor introduced the executives and chief officers. He urged residents to hold the public servants accountable and demand services from them, saying that it was their right to be served. (Edited by V. Graham)
