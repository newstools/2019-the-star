Harambee Stars risk being locked out of the 2022 Qatar World Cup qualifiers if the Football Kenya Federation fail to pay former coaches Bobby Williamson and Adel Amrouche their dues amounting to a colossal Sh163 million. FKF President Nick Mwendwa in an interview with a local TV station said they had received a letter from the world governing body, Fifa ordering them to pay Williamson (Sh55 million) and Amrouche(Sh108million). "The money has to be paid by March next year. I think the government should step in and assist in offsetting the debts," he said. Mwendwa added that in future, they will tailor their contracts with national team coaches to ensure a similar situation doesn't arise when a coach is sacked a few months into his deal or if he opts to resign. "We offered Amrouche an opportunity to return to the national team but he insisted on doing that and having his case continue so we do not want to be caught in such a tight situation in future," he said. In the interview, Mwendwa defended his decision to seek another term as the federation's President in spite of the struggles bedevilling Kenyan football. FKF has endured the loss of sponsorship, negative publicity (OB van saga) and a couple of court cases leaving Mwendwa and his team needing to explain and defend themselves at every turn. "My intention is to develop the game. I never got involved with football for the money. I used my salary to start out my football club. I cannot now let down the people who have shown the belief in me and leave football because of its struggles," he affirmed. On Thursday, Fifa's acting Chief Member Associations Officer VÃ©ron Mosengo-Omba raised concerns over the court cases brought against the federation over the electoral code and composition of the FKF electoral board.
