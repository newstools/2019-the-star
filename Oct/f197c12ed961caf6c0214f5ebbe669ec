Gor Mahia have been drawn against  Democratic Republic of Congo giants  DC Motema Pembe in the 2019-20 Caf Confederation Cup play-offs. The draw conducted on Tuesday night in Cairo, Egypt saw domestic cup holders Bandari FC paired against Gunea’s  Horoya SC. While, Bandari who knocked out Tunisia's US ben Guardene 3-2 on aggregate will be eyeing a historic confederations cup group stage berth, record 18 time KPL champions KO’gallo  will be gracing the stage for the third year running. Gor Mahia  led by new coach Steven Pollack crushed out of the CAF Champions league first round to Algerian champions   USM Alger 6-1 on aggregate,  to miss out on the big money bracket for the third straight year under a different coach. KO’gallo reached the Confederations quarter finals for the first time in over three decades under Turkish coach Hassan Oktay, only to suffer a 7-1 aggregate loss, to  2018/2019 finalists  RS Berkane of Morocco. This was at the back of falling in the group  stage of the same competition under Briton Dylan Kerr, the previous year. The dockers under home boy Bernard Mwalala, have punched way above their weight by eliminating US ben Guardene  and will  be seeking  to dine with continental Kings with an aggrerate win over Horoya. Horoya, fell to former CAF champions league winners  Orlando Pirates of South Africa. KO’gallo who won the Mandela cup title 1987, before it was renamed to Confederations cup must navigate through the tricky Congolese giants. If both sides sail through, they can face each other in the group stage set for next month.
