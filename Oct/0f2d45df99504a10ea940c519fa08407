It is misplaced to use the outcome of the just-concluded Mutonguni by-election in Kitui as a yardstick for Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka’s popularity, an MP said on Tuesday. During the by-election last Thursday, Maendeleo Chap Chap’s Musee Mati won with 2,893 votes beating Wiper’s Stephen Kithuka who garnered 2,147 votes. Speaking on the phone, Wiper’s Kitui Central MP Makali Mulu dismissed media reports that the win by Governor Alfred Mutua’s party was an indication that Kalonzo was "losing taste" in his Kitui home turf. “Mati was elected on the premise that he had a sound manifesto that impressed the voters. It was not because of his political party's popularity but because of his standing as an individual,” Mulu said. He said the results had nothing to do with the popularity of either Kalonzo or Mutua, who head the two parties with dominating votes. “It is likely that the people of Mutonguni gave Mati a sympathy vote because they believed he was robbed of his win in 2017. The voters also knew he had struggled a lot through a court petition to have the contentious 2017 polls annulled,” the MP said. Wiper is truly popular in Ukambani, the lawmaker said, adding that the truth will manifest itself in the general election. “Our party leader and the party remain the most popular in Ukambani. The fact will come out openly as the party will win most of the seats in 2022." Edited by R.Wamochie
