Holders KCB have made six changes to their squad ahead of their Impala Floodlit semi-final Homeboyz at the Impala Club today. The second semi pits Quins and Menengai Oilers. The bankers, who have won the event for the past two seasons, will give winger Mike Kimwele, forward Oscar Sorano and skipper Curtis Lilako, Nick Ongeri, Davies Chenge and Steve Wamae a start. They replace Tony Onyango, Patrick Ouko, Nelson Nyandat, Francis Mwita, Martin Owilah and James Ochieng. KCB thrashed Blak Blad 53-5 in the quarter-final last weekend. Head coach Curtis Olago termed the match as good preparation for the start of the Kenya Cup later this month. "We are giving everyone a chance to play this season and we have rotated the squad from last week to give everyone a chance,‚Äù said Olago. Homeboyz progressed to the semis after a hard-fought 23-14 win over Nondies in the last eight. Coach Jason Hector has named Zeden Marrow in place of Henry Ayah at midfield with the latter moving to fly-half to replace Evin Asena, who drops to the bench. Hooker Aaron Khalechi replaces Bruce Shiemi (bench), Emmanuel Silungi in for Polycarp Odhiambo and Brian Kitiva starts ahead of flanker Roy Wesonga. Max Kangeri makes the bench alongside Augustine Lugonzo, Joseph Amalemba and Abel Matanda. The semi is a repeat of last year's encounter which the bankers won 34-10. Quins will be aiming to for a place in the final for the first time in several years when they face Menengai Oilers. Dominique Habimana has made three changes for the intriguing clash. Two of the changes are at the backline while the other one is effected in the front-row. Eric Shikuku starts in place of Iddi Kakai as veteran Patrice Agunda misses out on the fixture and is replaced by Jacob Okumba. Impala will face Nakuru in the plate category as Nondies take on Blak Blad. In the schools' category, champions Ofafa Jericho have a date with Lenana School as Sunshine entertain Muhuri Muchiri.
