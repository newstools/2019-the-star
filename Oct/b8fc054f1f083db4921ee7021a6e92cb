Religious leaders in Kiambu have been urged to educate their flock about the importance of girls aged 10 getting the human papillomavirus vaccine. County health director David Ndegwa said it was important that parents know that the jab is not meant to make the girls sexually inactive for the rest of their lives. “Religious leaders can help health providers reach out to parents and tell them that the HPV vaccine is not meant for family planning but to prevent cervical cancer,” Ndegwa said. The county is targeting 42,000 girls and health workers will move to schools and the villages to administer the jab. The health director spoke at Karuri Level 4 Hospital in Kiambaa subcounty on Thursday during the launch of the HPV vaccination drive. Ndegwa said that parents should dispel the rumours that the jab is not safe and take advantage of the free service. A dose costs Sh25,000. “It is expensive to treat cervical cancer if not prevented and one can use up to Sh1 million in cancer management,” Ndegwa said. Nyathuna MCA Eddy Kinyanjui said that more awareness needs to be created on the need for HPV vaccine. Kinyanjui said that universal healthcare should be taken seriously by all as the government has put up resources to make sure that it is achieved. Kiambu county director of nursing services Betty Kasyoka urged parents to allow their daughters to get the jab. “A lot is being said over the HPV vaccine but most do not know what it is. It is high time that people got to know what is going on,” Kasyoka said. The county security team has said that it will take action on people who will spread rumours inciting the public not to accept the vaccine.
