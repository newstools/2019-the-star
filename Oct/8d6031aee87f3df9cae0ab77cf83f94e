Kisii Governor James Ongwae has said his administration has negotiated with the US to open branded Kisii coffee shops to motivate farmers. Ongwae said the shops will enable Kisiis living in the US access the product and boost farmers’ income. “I have negotiated with the USA to open a shop for branded Kisii coffee  to motivate farmers to boost production by expanding the crop’s export,” Ongwae said. Speaking to the Star by phone, the county boss said coffee from Gusii region was among the best globally and it was being used to blend coffees from other countries. It fetches high prices while farmers in the area live in abject poverty. He said his government was working with Gusii Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union and other stakeholders to expand coffee marketing outside the country. “I am urging small scale coffee farmers to improve the quality of their coffee to compete with coffees from other countries to increase their economic base and that of the county,” he said. GCFCU chief executive Robert Mainya said plans are under way for the union to mill more coffee and market it. Mainya said the union has purchased a commercial roaster machine to improve processing, adding they will supply the product to shops, supermarkets and affiliate cooperative societies to enhance sales. “The coffee produced in our mill has no additives. We have acquired certificates from relevant authorities and are ready to put our coffee in the market,” Mainya said in his office. He deplored dwindling coffee prices in the international market, adding the union was seeking international buyers. The CEO urged Kenyans to consume more local coffee to mitigate the fluctuating coffee prices in international markets. He asked the county government to employ extension officers to sensitize farmers on proper coffee farming  to boost production.
