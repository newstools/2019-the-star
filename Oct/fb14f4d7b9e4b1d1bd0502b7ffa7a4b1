More than 400 KCPE candidates in Kisumu Central constituency have received exam materials from Gilani Foundation and James Were Foundation. The candidates from five schools in the informal settlements received geometrical sets and clipboards. The schools are Dunga, Pand Pieri, Nanga, Ringroad orphans and Bridge International primary schools. Speaking while distributing the materials, James Were said the students will also be served lunch on the last day of the exams. He said the programme aims at encouraging pupils to do well in exams. Were said most of the students are needy and their parents cannot afford the exam materials. “We want the candidates to sit their exams with a peaceful mind so that they can fully concentrate,” he said. Were promised full scholarships for who will achieve 400 marks and above in the KCPE exam. “Since we started this programme around 2013, each year, we give a scholarship to the best students from the schools who score 400 and above marks. We will continue to do this," he said. Last year, two of the top KCPE candidates from Nyalenda received sponsorship for their secondary education. The two had scored 426 and 414 marks. They joined Maranda Boys and Kakamega High school.
