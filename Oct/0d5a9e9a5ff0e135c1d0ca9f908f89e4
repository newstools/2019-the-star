Former Discovery Kenya Cross country champion Josephat Kipchirchir will use the inaugural Eldama Ravine race to build up for Lisbon Half Marathon on October 20. Kipchirchir, who trains in Kapsabet, said he will be competing in the 10km category as he seeks to improve on his speed work ahead of Lisbon race. “I wanted to compete in 21km but I changed my mind considering Lisbon is only 20 days away,” he said. He said he is optimistic of posting better results in Lisbon going by his experience in road races—both local and international. Athletics Kenya (AK) Baringo County chairman, Barnaba Kitilit, said he is happy races have increased in Baringo County and this will work to the advantage of athletes. “We had Chemususu Marathon early September and this Saturday, we will host Eldama Ravine,” he said.
