The Law Society of Kenya will this week offer pro bono services to victims of gender-based violence and those with mental challenges in Machakos county. The LSK â€“ lower eastern chapter will offer the services during Legal Awareness Week at the High Court in Machakos. The event started on Monday and will end on Friday. The theme of the week is "eradicating gender-based violence and focusing on mental health in Machakos county". The LSK officials said such victims and their relatives have a hard time in getting justice and that is why they have volunteered to offer free services. Speaking during the launch on Monday, Machakos High Court judge Justice George Odunga said the lawyers intend to promote the mandate of the LSK by extending legal literacy and awareness to members of the public. "The LSK is under an obligation to facilitate legal education for members of the public," he said. Justice Odunga said cases of gender violence have increased in the country. South Eastern LSK branch chairman Justus Mutia said, "We need to ask ourselves what has made our homes, which are supposed to be the most secure places, hotbeds of violence." Makueni MP Daniel Maanzo urged the county and national governments to allocate funds for rehabilitation centres for people with mental illnesses. He said each county should have a unit to treat people with mental challenges in every public health facility.
