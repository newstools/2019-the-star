Police in Narok have beefed up security ahead of the festivities. Narok county police commander John Kizito said the operation will be concentrated in various hotspots around the county to curb insecurity. “We have decided to apply this operational order because this festive season is known for notorious criminal activities such as muggings, drunk driving, formation of criminal gangs and rare cases of terrorists,” he said. Some areas highlighted by the police commander include the Maasai Mara Game Reserve, where thousands of local and foreign tourists are expected to flock, clubs, roads and street corners deemed not safe by residents. Kizito said the operation started on December 1 this year and will end on January 5, 2020. “Our police officers will be on patrol 24 hours to ensure the county is safe from criminals and terrorists,” Kizito. He also said the initiative will be supervised by corporals and police inspectors, who will in turn be supervised by officers commanding police stations, subcounty commanders and the county commander. “This operation order has changed normal supervision and is deemed more commanding than that of normal day-to-day police activity,” the police boss said. Kizito urged residents to be more vigilant. “We are not taking chances and want to assure residents and visitors that they are safe and can enjoy their stay here,” he said. The county, whose 60 per cent of revenue is derived from tourism, has been receiving hundreds of visitors after security improved drastically in recent years.
