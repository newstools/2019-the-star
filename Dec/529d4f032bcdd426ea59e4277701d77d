Four families in Ol Kalou town have expressed concerns of disease outbreak after their homes were flooded because the authorities ordered overflow water directed to their residence. They said the Ol Kalou municipal board has directed that all the water spilling from commercial and residential buildings in the town be directed to the toilets within the building. The board said releasing waste and floodwater to the streets would interfere with the ongoing tarmacking of roads in Ol Kalou town. The board chairman Mwangi Nyagac ould not be reached for comment as his phone was out of reach. “But after only two days the toilet got filled up. It is now overflowing causing the whole plot to flood,” a tenant said The tenants said they are forced to wear gumboots to access their houses or go out. Those who do not have gumboots are forced to remove their shoes and walk barefoot through the dirty water. They expressed fear that if the ongoing rain persists for a day longer, raw human waste will find its way into their living rooms. They called on the Ol Kalou municipal board chairman to visit the plot and witness the misery he has subjected them to. Efforts to have their landlady, Perpetua Muthoni use an exhauster to empty the toilet has fallen on deaf ears. The tenants say Muthoni has been insulting them, saying she did her work as directed by the municipal boss. But Muthoni denied insulting the tenants. She said she only demanded to know why they exposed her to the media. She said the municipal board chairman Mwangi Nyaga is to blame for issuing the directive which has caused the mess. Muthoni said she was given two days to direct all the water spilling from her building to the toilet, which she complied with. The landlady said she has no money set aside to meet two days' directives. “You have children. You have a family to feed,” she said
