A woman from Migori is suspected to have committed suicide by jumping into the raging River Kuja after she was unable to pay Sh9,000 loan she took from a sacco. A sacco from which the woman had secured a soft loan threatened to auction off her property to cover the amount. This caused her distress. Uriri subcounty police commander Peter Njoroge said the deceased had just attended a merry-go-round meeting. “Her colleagues criticised her after she failed to repay the money during a meeting on Jamhuri Day,” he said. Njoroge said as she was heading home, she alighted from the motorcycle and dived into the swollen river. “She was carried on a motorbike by one of the group members but she requested to alight and pick her leso which had fallen. When the motorbike stopped she dived into River Kuja and drowned,” the police chief expplained. The officer said attempts to rescue the woman were unsuccessful. “Ridicule by her colleagues caused her distress,” Njoroge said. Search for the body is still underway
