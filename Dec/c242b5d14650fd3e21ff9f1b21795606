Fourty-six people narrowly escaped death after a matatu they were travelling in was swept by swollen waters of River Kyamela along Emali-Ukia Road in Makueni County. The matatu was ferrying 40 university students and four staff alongside the driver and conductor from Lukenya to Nairobi at the time of the Friday morning incident. The matatu had diverted from the Mombasa - Nairobi Highway to avoid a traffic snarl up following an accident. Makueni County police commander Joseph Napeiyan confirmed all the passengers were safe after rescue operations. The matatu remains stuck in the river.
