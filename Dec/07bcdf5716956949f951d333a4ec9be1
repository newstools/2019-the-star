  The Village Market complex has been recognised as the most innovative shopping mall brand in Kenya at the Global Brand Awards gala held at Emperor Palace in Johannesburg, South Africa. Village Market’s MD Hamed Ehsani received the prestigious award in the category of lifestyle. “I’m happy to receive this award which proves that there is still a huge opportunity to grow business in Kenya and the whole of Africa,” Ehsan said. Global Brand Awards was established with the aim of honouring excellence in performance and rewarding companies that perform extraordinarily well in the fields of finance, education, hospitality, lifestyle, automobiles and technology. The awards are given to acknowledge key players who strive for fineness and provide a platform for recognition. The award also aims to identify and create awareness about the significance of exceptional service delivery and reward their performance. The Village Market Shopping complex last year expanded with a 215-room urban business hotel that has conferencing facilities and a world-class family entertainment and recreation centre. Earlier this year, Village Market was voted the best shopping mall by the public and received an award during the inaugural East FM Star Awards 2019.
