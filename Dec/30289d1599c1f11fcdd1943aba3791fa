Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has had a change of heart and decided not to sue rapper King Kaka over his controversial song 'Wajinga Nyinyi'. Waiguru on Friday described Kaka as a 'confused, attention seeking young man'. She tweeted: Waiguru, through her lawyers Kiragu Wathuta and Company Advocates, had on Monday written a demand letter to Kaka, for linking her with the National Youth Service scandal. She had said the utterances in the song were without basis and amounted to 'gross and blatant misrepresentation of facts and deliberate mischaracterization' of her conduct. Waiguru had given Kaka 48 hours to offer an unequivocal, unqualified and unreserved retraction as well as an apology subject to her lawyer's review and approval. He had also been asked to permanently, immediately and unconditionally withdraw, pull down and or delete the song from all social media platforms including but not limited to Twitter and YouTube. On Friday, Waiguru said, "It is unfortunate when talented youth are taken advantage of by some politicians and used to settle political scores. As I have chosen in previous occasions of this nature, I will contend with their masters."
