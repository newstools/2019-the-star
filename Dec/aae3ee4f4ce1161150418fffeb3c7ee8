Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper party will starting next month undertake a massive recruitment drive in Nairobi. The party seeks to trouble the hold of ODM and Jubille parties on Nairobi politics and ensure its followers take part in the staggered party primaries. Officials who held a meeting at Bomas of Kenya told the Star that the strategy is to ensure the party competes effectively in the coming polls. They want  strong and popular candidates who can win many elective seats in the capital city. “We organised this meeting to review the year and plan ahead so that we grow, remain strong and command a good following,” party stalwart Fred Musau told the Star on the phone. The party is building on the success of Musili Mawathe in Embakasi South constituency by-elections earlier this year to target more seats in the city. “We know we have the numbers and we must organise ourselves at the grassroots. We are targeting 20 ward seats and five constituencies in Nairobi come the next general elections,” Musau said. The party officials also unveiled plans to revitalise the subcounty branches so that they can create a strong electorate constituency to influence policies at the national level. The Friday meeting was attended by Nairobi branch chairman Roy Kivusyu and deputy secretary general Peter Mathuki (ex-EALA Member of Parliament). “The party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has asked us to continue uniting the country, pushing the development agenda and ensuring the country remains peaceful,” Kivusyu said. The forum was organised by the Nairobi leadership to review this year's branch activities and build on previous successes and failures to strengthen the party.
