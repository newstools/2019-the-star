The curtains closed on Tuesday for the UNiTE campaign 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence which began on November 25. On the ground, however, the real work is just starting. The campaign this year is themed 'Orange the World: Generation Equality Stands Against Rape!' It is difficult to establish the exact figures of rape mainly because of the culture of victim-blaming. However, UN Women estimates that 35 per cent of all women globally have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner. These statistics are worrying and the fight against rape must start by destigmatising survivors. Rape has adverse psychological effects on survivors which include fear, anger, shame, self-blaming and depression among others. As such, it is critical to support survivors to get the help they need. In that light, the initiative taken up by media personality and social activist Adelle Onyango is highly commendable. She has always been vocal about her rape ordeal. Her latest project dubbed #Safe247 will assist survivors to deal with trauma through professional counselling. We must all commit to making the world a safer space for girls and women. Only then can we achieve generation equality.  Nairobi
