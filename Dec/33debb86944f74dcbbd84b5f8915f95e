Two casual labours at a Baringo South farm have died after being hospitalised over suspected food poisoning. Another 13 are still receiving treatment at Baringo Referral Hospital, Kabarnet. The casualties said they started experiencing stomach pains and vomiting after eating githeri served at their employer's farm for lunch at work on Friday. They were then rushed to hospital and two succumbed on Friday night. “Two of them died on Friday night, one is admitted at the Intensive Care Unit while the rest are in stable condition and they are being attended to in the wards” County health executive Mary Panga said on Saturday. She said going by the symptoms the patients seem to have suffered from food poisoning, “although it is yet to be fully ascertained” Panga said. She said the samples of the substance were taken to the Government laboratory and that the results shall be announced once they are out. County Commissioner Henry Wafula said police searching for the farm owner for questioning.
