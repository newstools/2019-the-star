The manner in which the Building Bridges Initiative issues are being executed is a clear indication that this project is all about the political survival of President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga after 2022. In any essence, anything to do with the unity of Kenya must be an all-people-and-leaders driven exercise irrespective of their political or ethnic persuasions. There is no way two people could sit at Harambee House and singlehandedly decide something that is good for the entire country without involving other leaders. The reason why there is violence after every poll is that election losers are not willing to accept defeat. They believe they cannot lose fairly and can only lose ‘because someone rigged the exercise’. This has not been addressed in the BBI report. What was the harm of involving all leaders from the onset, if what they are pursuing through BBI is indeed about the 47 million Kenyans? But again, Jubilee Party, under the leadership of President Kenyatta is divided down the middle, yet the President is claiming of uniting the country through the BBI. He cannot purport to unite the country when his own house is in tatters. He must first start by uniting Jubilee. Furthermore, why should the President extend the term of the BBI task force yet the same team had gone around the country seeking the opinion of Kenyans before they came up with their report? All Kenyans have agreed to support the BBI recommendations and it is unbelievable that the same team is being given another job of advising on how the report can be implemented. This is a waste of funds while Kenyans experience economic hardships yet we want to waste another Sh10 billion on an exercise that’s not necessary.  Kericho
