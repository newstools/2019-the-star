The High Court has ordered the National Treasury and the Controller of Budget to immediately disburse funds due to 35 county governments. Justice Weldon Korir also issued an order against Treasury from withholding any funds to the county governments without complying with the mandatory requirements of the Constitution. The judge issued the orders after the Council of Governors (COG) argued that unless the court intervenes, service delivery in the counties will grind to a halt as a majority of county employees have currently not been paid their salaries and allowances. In the case, COG sued Treasury, Controller of Budget and the Attorney General after attempts by the State to withhold the funds. COG claimed that Treasury and controller of budget have failed to timely disburse the equitable share of revenue as is required by the provisions of the public finance management act. "Their actions undermine the very foundation of devolution and the distinctness and independence of county governments.  They acted in total disregard of these provisions in view of their failure to disburse the equitable share due to 35 county governments for the month of November 2019,” said COG According to the court documents, service delivery in the counties has grounded to a halt in view of the willful failure by the two organs to disburse the counties’ equitable share of revenue. COG argued that the fourth schedule of the constitution delineates functions between the national and 47 county governments and In order to effectively undertake the functions, the county governments have to be sufficiently resourced. The case will be heard on 28 January.
