Kenya Defence Forces choppers have been deployed to deliver food to areas affected by floods in Garissa. Areas hardest-hit by the floods are Ijara, Hulugho, Sangailu, Bothai, Galmagala. The situation has been worsened by poor roads rendered impassable by rains. The military on Monday delivered food and non-food items to four locations. Others got help on Wednesday. The items include rice, wheat flour, maize flour, sugar, nutritious supplements for children, and mattresses and blankets. However, local leaders said the situation is dire and might get out of hand because dispensaries in various areas have run out of stock. “The situation is so bad, no vehicle can go to some of these areas, some commercial vehicles are still stuck in the muddy roads. We appeal to the government and the international community for help,” Ijara MP Sophia Abdinoor told the press at Garissa Airstrip. She commended the military for delivering food and non-food items to locals. Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane was present at Garissa airstrip. "We have teamed up with the national government, the WFP and the Kenya Red Cross Society to ensure IDP camps in Garissa town affected by the floods and far-flung subcounties get help," Dagane said. The deputy governor assured residents of Garissa county that the humanitarian support will continue until the situation improves. Garissa county commissioner Meru Mwangi said the Devolution ministry will ensure relief supplies reach all flood victims. “We have formed a multi-agency coordination unit that includes the Kenya Red Cross and other agencies, and we are working closely with KDF to deliver,” he said. Commuters have also been stranded in Garissa. Travellers from Masalani coming to Garissa had to use dhows near River Tana before boarding vehicles to Garissa Town.
