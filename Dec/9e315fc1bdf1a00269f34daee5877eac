A photo of gospel singer Weezdom with a woman who resembles fellow gospel artist Nicah The Queen has gone viral on social media. But Nica told Word Is on Monday, "That's not me. That can never be me. I have never been involved in any relationship with Weezdom." Weezdom, whose phone went unanswered, had been trending a few weeks ago after a woman accused him of infecting her with a disease. He has denied the claims. He is currently making headlines with the song Bila Pesa, featuring fellow EMB singer Peter Blessing.
