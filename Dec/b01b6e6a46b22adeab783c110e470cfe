Rwanda is set to begin trials with an injection that will replace daily, oral antiretroviral (ARV) HIV drugs, according to the pro-government New Times website. The injection slowly and continuously releases HIV medication into the blood for eight weeks, the report says. If successful, HIV patients will no longer have to take the oral treatment, which they have to remember to take every day. The jab is regarded as an improved and more sustainable treatment, Rwanda's Biomedical Centre head Dr Sabin Nsanzimana is quoted as saying. Details of the drug are yet to be made public, but the trial is set to be discussed at the International Conference on Aids Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Africa (Icasa) in Kigali this week.
