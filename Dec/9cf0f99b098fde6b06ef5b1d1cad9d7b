Police in Keroka, Nyamira county, have arrested three suspects in connection with the theft of computers from Karatantini Primary School. The tablets were reported lost three weeks ago by the school management. Sixteen tablets, a World Space Radio and a projector were recovered from one suspect, Keroka OCPD Robert Ntambiri said. They were found hidden in a maize farm within the homestead, police said. Suspect Bwogo Omwenga was apprehended after days on the run. Two other suspects – Edwin Momanyi and Peter Aboko – were also arrested. Ten more tablets were recovered, Ntambiri said. Police are yet to determine the motive behind the theft. “We are still questioning them to find out if there were other accomplices,” Ntambiri said. They will be arraigned on Monday. Separately, residents of Manga Isecha in Kitutu Chache North, Kisii county, have protested insecurity in their area.  They said there had been at least 10 robberies in the area in the last two weeks.
