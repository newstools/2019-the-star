Kenya has continued to cement herself as the global safari destination champion after scooping the prestigious 2019 World leading safari destination by World Travel Awards (WTA). Kenya topped as a home to World leading Safari lodge destination won by Mahali Mzuri, crowning the consistency the destination has had in this category having previously won the award five times in the last seven years; 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017. In the Africa category, Kenya won Africa’s leading destination award as well as the leading destination management company while Nairobi was voted Africa’s leading business travel destination. The country’s tourism marketing agency Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) was voted Africa’s leading tourist board while Kenyatta International Convention Center (KICC) was voted Africa’s leading meeting conference destination. Diani won Africa’s leading beach destination while Kenya Airways received the Africa leading Business and Economy class airline award. KTB chief executive Betty Radier said that the win was testament to the fact that tourists and business people across the globe prefer Kenya to other destinations because of its diverse offerings. “We are very delighted to win this global awards because it shows great honor to Kenya’s safari offering which is loved worldwide,” she said. She added that the increased preference by visitors into the country is proof that Kenya’s travel and hospitality industry is definitely on the right track. “We will not back down our efforts of creating magical experiences for our visitors. Indeed, I can assure everyone that there is something for everyone who tours Kenya,” Radier said. Data by the Tourism Research Institute shows between January and September the number of international visitors grew by 251 to 1,515,433 compared to the same period last year. On the other hand tourism earnings grew to Sh115.1 billion up from Sh114.4 billion in a similar period last year.
