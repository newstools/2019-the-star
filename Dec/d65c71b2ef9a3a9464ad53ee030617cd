Peter Tabichi, the science teacher who won the Sh100 million Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize 2019, has been appointed the Dettol hygiene ambassador. “For me, teaching is a very powerful job. I want to be part of building the next generation, making sure that the students are learning valuable knowledge and skills to make a better future in a scary situation," he said. "It will be my great honour to work with various partners to ensure that we are reducing sanitation-related ailments among school-going children across the country.” The student-led school hygiene programme was launched in August to help reduce sanitation-related ailments among school-going children. The 36-year-old, who is also the first 'Champion for Children in Conflicts and Crisis' for Education Cannot Wait, will champion the cause to more than 9 million school-going children across the country. “Dettol has over the years focused its interventions on school hygiene programmes, targeting children in both urban and rural areas," said Reckitt Benckiser Africa Expansion Director Health, Dele Adeyole. "Today, we are honoured to partner with the world’s best teacher in the fight against hygiene-based diseases in our schools." The science and mathematics teacher at Keriko Secondary School, Pwani village, in Nakuru county, gives away 80 per cent of his monthly income to help the less privileged. He helped set up a science nurturing club in a school that had only one computer. Tabichi says the initiative helped pupils research and design projects that qualified them for national competitions. His students won the Royal Society of Chemistry award after harnessing local plant life to generate electricity.
