The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has rubbished claims that the Kenyan rapper Kinga Kaka has been summoned to appear before them. The rapper had earlier on Tuesday claimed through his Twitter account that he had been summoned to appear at DCI headquarters in Kiambu road. Hours after his allegations, DCI refuted the claims of the summon through their official Twitter account. "We wish to condemn strongly false information being peddled through social media to the effect that one Kennedy Ombima King Kaka has been summoned," DCI tweeted. It added that any person seeking attention or publicity using their platform will face consequences. The rapper had alleged that his latest song 'Wajinga Nyinyi' was the cause of the drama. Through his song, the artist had highlighted cases of corruption that had been reported but suddenly swept under the carpet. Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru had threatened to sue him for defamation.
