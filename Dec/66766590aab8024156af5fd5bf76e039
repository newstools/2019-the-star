Promotion-chasing Mombasa Sports Club has been urged to avoid complacency when they take on Impala and Kisumu Youngstars in must-win games at the City Park Stadium this weekend. MSC play Impala today and Youngstars tomorrow and face a fight in their hands if they are to be elevated to the men hockey Premier League. The Super League outfit are in a two-way battle with Kenya College of Accountancy who are done with their fixtures and have garnered 43 points. The coastal side has 37 points and anything less than six points will be a blow to the Fredrick Arika tutored side. Parkroad sealed their place with three games to spare and their immediate return was inevitable after an unbeaten run. Arika said it is time for the players to rise for the occasion adding that their good season will mean nothing if his side cannot claim their place. He anticipates a tough battle specifically from relegation-threatened Impala and called for calmness and alertness because they are equally a dangerous side despite their struggles. "No need to put ourselves under pressure but we need to take the games as they come. We need to be cautious and I am sure these sides will give us a run for our money. Pushing ourselves to the limit is a requirement if we have to realise our ambition. The team has missed playing in the top tier and we are ready for the challenge." In the corresponding women category, leaders Wolverines will move a step closer to attaining promotion should they beatÂ  Nakuru. Second-placed Orange Leonas take on Vikings. Meanwhile, the only remaining men Premier League fixture pitting Sailors and United States International University USIU-A Mashujaa will be played today. Sailors are seventh and a win will make them move a slot above Mashujaa.
