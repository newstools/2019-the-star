Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua has faulted the Building Bridges Initiatives report “for diluting powers of the prime minister". “The position of the PM should have powers and privileges. If it is the hybrid of parliamentary and presidential [systems], the PM should be with clouds and can stand and speak to the president," Wambua said yesterday. Wambua spoke on the sidelines of the launch of the third Annual Kitui Cultural festival and goat auction at Red Cross building, Parliament Square. BBI proposes the introduction of the prime minister, who will be appointed by the president and endorsed by Parliament to deal with the winner takes all situation. The Senator challenged President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga to fast track the formation of the technical team to spearhead the process. He said Kenyans should be allowed to read the document and air their views openly. “Kenyans should read the document before making their decisions,” he said. Wambua said the decision to allow the speaker of the county assembly to appoint deputy speaker if the governor fails over a given time does not fly for him.
