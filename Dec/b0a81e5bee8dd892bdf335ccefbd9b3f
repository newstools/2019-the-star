Chiefs and assistants who abet FGM will face the sack, Chief Administrative Secretary Ministry for Public Service, Youth, and Gender Rachel Shebesh has warned. Shebesh said three chiefs already had been arrested in Kajiado and Meru counties for abetting FGM. She said those found culpable will be punished and said assistant chiefs are especially knowledgeable. Speaking on Tuesday in Nanyuki town after she met the Laikipia county security committee and local administrators, the CAS also said the state would also arrest parents, circumcisers add village elders who turn a blind eye. President Uhuru Kenyatta has called for the elimination of FGM by 2022. "We are telling the chiefs to stop being negotiators with those who practice FGM but instead arrest those involved and let them face the law. This outdated traditional practice cannot continue," Shebesh said. She said he ministry has a work plan to eradicate FGM by 2022. “Laikipia is a counties where FGM is widely practised but undercover and that's why we are telling the county commissioner, chiefs and assistants that where it happens the law should intervene. "If they are not part of eradicating the problem, they will be held liable," Shebesh said. The biggest responsibility was on assistant chiefs who interact daily with village residents and are best placed to know when and where the crime is carried and, and where it is planned, she said. “There is no assistant chief who doesn’t know in their locality everybody by name and what they do so we're hoping that this synergy will work to eradicate FGM,” the CAS said.
