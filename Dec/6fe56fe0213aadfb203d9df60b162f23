The government has intensified security in Mombasa and other coastal areas during the holidays. Coast Regional Commissioner John Elungata said on Friday that security would be strict at beaches, churches and other popular spots. Security will be strengthened to prevent increased crime and terrorist attacks by al Shabaab. “The police, Coast Guard and Kenya Wildlife Service rangers will be on joint patrols," Elungata said after chairing a regional security meeting at his 1office in Mombasa. Elungata also announced that the Sh460 million waterfront Mama Ngina Drive Park will open to the public on Monday. “The modem public recreational facility will boost tourism and reposition Mombasa as a top tourist destination in the region," he said. The park is expected to attract more than 1.5 million visitors over the holidays. It was closed immediately after Mashujaa Day celebrations to allow for repairs and improvements. Elungata warned PSV operators against violating traffic regulations, saying stern action will be taken to ensure road safety and protection of passengers. He said traffic police will arrest on the spot any passengers over the legal capacity of any PSV. Thousands of domestic and international visitors are visiting the Coast. (Edited by V. Graham)
