The ongoing heavy rains in the country have continued to cause damages to many businesses across the country. The latest to be affected is The Lord Erroll restaurant, located in Runda Estate, Nairobi. The management on Tuesday said it will resume business when floods rescind. Zahra Moi, the owner of the upmarket restaurant, explained that the flooding was a result of the nearby river breaking its banks. “The flooding we have suffered is nothing compared to the devastating losses many Kenyans have suffered in the last few weeks. We would like to sympathise with them and hope that they will get some relief,” she said. Pictures of the flooded restaurant emerged on Tuesday morning after days of heavy rains that have killed more than 200 people across the country. Pictures showed the restaurant's interior and the roads leading to it flooded and virtually impassable. Its corridors were filled with water as the tables and chairs of the once impeccable award-winning restaurant filled with dirty water. The ongoing rains have also rendered a number of roads in Nairobi impassable due to floods. While issuing a statement last week on the state of the heavy rains across the county, government spokesperson Cyrus Oguna said that the Kenya National Highways Authority had dispatched its personnel to access the state of the roads countrywide. Oguna added that 132 people had been killed by floods since the onset of the heavy rains. The weather forecast from the meteorological department indicates that the rains are expected to continue for the better part of December.
