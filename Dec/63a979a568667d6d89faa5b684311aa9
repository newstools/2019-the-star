A company accused of graft at City Hall gave Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko Sh8.2 million for his campaigns, the DPP has revealed. "Hardi Enterprises Limited is owned by Anthony Mwaura Ng'ang'a and Rose Njeri Ng'ang'a. The two funded the election campaign of the Governor in April-May 2017 elections to a tune of Sh8,600,000," the DPP said on Monday. In a chart illustrating how Sonko is tied to his co-accused, the DPP said Hardi Enterprises also transferred Sh3 million to Toddy Civil Engineering and then the money ended up in the governor's bank account. Directors of Hardi and Toddy were on Monday arraigned in court alongside Sonko and others over the alleged misappropriation of Sh357.3 million belonging to the county. "The company transferred some of the funds paid by NCC to an affiliate company, Toddy Engineering Ltd, whose directors are Anthony Ng'ang'a and Rose Ng'ang'a," the DPP said. The DPP then said that it is after this that the money ended up in an account belonging to Sonko. The DPP also said the tender was not advertised and that the bidders were contacted in person. The negotiation, tender opening and evaluation committee was not consulted properly in awarding of the tender. The DPP also revealed that the company passed through the evaluation despite the fact that it did not have the trucks and was awarded the tender. On tender implementation, the DPP said some of the vehicles to be used to collect the garbage are registered as saloon cars. It also revealed that invoices forwarded by the Hardi company were paid in excess of the amount quoted without an explanation. The governor was arrested on Friday while in Voi, Taita-Taveta county, and spent the weekend locked up. He was charged alongside 16 other suspects. Sonko will spend an additional two days locked up after the court said it would rule on bail on Wednesday.
