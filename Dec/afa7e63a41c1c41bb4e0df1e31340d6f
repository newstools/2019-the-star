Two lovers in Naivasha were drinking in a bar on Sunday, they quarrelled, then he started to kiss and make up. Then she bit off a chunk of his tongue, swallowed it and fled to Karagita estate along Moi South Lake Road. The victim was bleeding profusely and rushed to a nearby health centre. He was unable to speak and record a statement with police. Elder Solomon Mwangi said the motive behind the attack was still a mystery. “The two had been drinking for sometime when the man started kissing the woman and it’s not clear what caused her to turn against her lover,” he said. He said that the two were well known in the community and residents were in shock. “After biting off a very big chunk of the tongue, the woman swallowed it and fled leaving the man writhing in pain and he was rushed to the hospital,” Mwangi said. Area chief Hassan Guyo said the police were seeking the woman. The man was in great pain and undergoing treatment, he said. “The man cannot talk as a big part of his tongue is missing while the suspect responsible for the attack has gone missing,” he said. Meanwhile, the search for a man washed away by River Malewa in Naivasha last week entered its fourth day. Friends and relatives gathered at the banks of the swollen river but divers were unable to venture gushing waters in Olmagogo area. Elder Amos Kimani said the man had been a worker at the nearby Morendat farm and was at work when he was swept away. “At the moment, there is very little that we can do but wait for the body to float. It’s very dangerous to enter into the river,” he said. Two weeks ago, the river burst its banks, flooding nearby farms and homes but the levels have since dropped. (Edited by V. Graham)
