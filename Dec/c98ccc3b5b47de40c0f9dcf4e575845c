Deputy president William Ruto has assured Jubilee party members that the party was intact despite speculation that it was on its deathbed. While addressing Chepngobod Methodist Church followers at Ainamoi Constituency, Kericho county, the deputy criticised those claiming Jubilee was falling apart. Enroute to yet another Sunday Service in Kisii, the Deputy President gave assurances that he and President Uhuru Kenyatta were in control of the party. He was accompanied by Kericho Governor Prof Paul Chepkwony, Ainamoi MP Silvanus Maritim and Belgut MP Nelson Koech Sonko. “President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is the party leader, and I as his deputy, are going to weather and win imaginary challenges being propelled by prophets of doom,” Ruto said. He called for an end to grumbling in Jubilee and reminded those behind the propaganda to stop. He lauded unity among Kericho county leaders, right from religious leaders to politicians and urged them to remain united. “Christian churches have been instrumental in development of this county due to unity between them and political leadership,” Ruto said. The DP said the Sh1.2 billion Kimugu River water treatment plant will be completed in eight months time. While commending the governor for procurement of the ten-acre plot on behalf of the county residents, DP said the money was a loan from Belgium government. The county government bought the ten-acre plot near Duka Moja on the Kericho-Nakuru highway at Sh102 million to establish a water treatment plant. It is meant to boost water supply to Kericho town.
