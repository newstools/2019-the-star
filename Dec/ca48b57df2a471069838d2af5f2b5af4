Atlancis Technologies has provided free tranches of the iLearn e-learning content being rolled out by KICD into more than 20,000 state primary schools, in a move to accelerate the digitisation of Kenya’s private primary schools. The company, which was this month named a Top 100 company for innovation, has created the only Kenyan digital content produced for the Competency Based Curriculum (CBC) by Kenyan teachers, as part of its strategy of populating its Kenyan cloud platform with transformatory local content. “It was an honour to be selected by Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) this year to provide digital content for the new curriculum for Grades 1 and 2,” Atlancis CEO Daniel Njuguna said. He said the firm will also provide teachers with training and set-up support as part of a much bigger investment in ground-breaking education cloud technology to deliver on the government’s vision of a digitalised education system for all Kenyans. “Today, we are taking the next step again, with the launch of a learning management system offering some of the iLearn content for free and providing schools with digital libraries, the capacity to create quizzes, interactive lessons and every type of e-learning content,'' he added. In addition to being awarded as an innovator in this month’s Top 100 awards, Atlancis Technologies has been lauded internationally by the Open Compute Project, launched by Facebook and partners, as the first company in Africa to install its state-of-the-art open source data centre infrastructure. The technology has cut the cost of data centre hardware to a fraction of previous levels and positioned Atlancis to deliver local cloud services that are far more cost efficient than was previously possible. ''Having seen it approved and implemented by KICD into the Kenyan schooling system, we have worked hard to now expand it to create a user-friendly learning management system that private schools can access within hours of signing up,” Njuguna said.
