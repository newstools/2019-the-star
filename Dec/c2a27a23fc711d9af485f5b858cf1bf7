Rayvanny's baby mama Fahima has spoken about an alleged condom that was spotted at the singer's video shoot of his song, "I Love You". In an interview with Lil Ommy, Fahima said, "As I said before, I will not talk much about my relationship with the father of my child. When the right time comes, I’ll speak up. I need time to process this. I do not want to talk about it because it still hurts." When asked if she broke it off with Rayvanny over infidelity, she said, "No. We have other personal issues. Nana (the video vixen who is rumoured to have had a thing with the singer) has nothing to do with our split." Adding, "We have problems and they can be solved, but there are other problems. You need to take a break to be able to handle them." Rayvanny in a rant took to social media, claiming that Fahima wanted a life that he could not afford. She defended herself, saying, "It is not true. But there is a problem and we are fixing it. For now, we are not together and I cannot tell when we will be back together." Adding, "No, I have not unfollowed the father of my child. I have never unfollowed him. I believe in life there is a lot of misunderstanding even in a relationship. "Days will come when you’re angry and you can do anything, which might then lead to regret. Your partner may have done you wrong, and in the midst of trying to fix it, you then end up going overboard. "He has taught me a lot and without him, I wouldn’t be where I am. We cannot be perfect all the time, but I believe we will go past this. I had no beef with her. I broke up with her man for other reasons, then her story came later on."
