Since he took over the reins, yet again, as Sofapaka head coach, John Baraza has not been on the losing side in the  Kenyan Premier League. Tomorrow,  against Kisumu All Stars, he will lead his side to their sixth outing looking to improve his run that has seen Batoto Ba Mungu collect  11 points from their last five matches. That total is a vast improvement on their previous seven points in as many matches under the departed Divaldo Alves. "We are all working well together in training. The players are determined to ensure that our target for the season remains on course. I am happy with our performances so far but we cannot afford to take our foot off the gas pedal," said Baraza. Baraza added that they will not underestimate the league's new boys, who are yet to pick victory on their travels. "Every match in this league is tough. we expect nothing different from All Stars but a tough game. we must contain them from the start to get the three points," he remarked. Brian Nyakan and Peter Lwasa are set to once again lead the search for goals as the 2009 champions look to return to winning ways. All Stars will not be pliable opponents, however, as they seek to arrest their recent losing run of two matches. Henry Omino's side have not scored in those two defeats, conceding three unanswered goals against Zoo Kericho last time out. All Stars will depend on Gerishon Arabe and Eric Otieno, who were on target the last time 'Otenga' breached their opponents' defence and kept a clean sheet. With eight points, All Stars are seven points away from the direct relegation zone, currently occupied by Chemelil Sugar who suffered their 11th defeat of the campaign  at the hands of Western Stima on Saturday.
