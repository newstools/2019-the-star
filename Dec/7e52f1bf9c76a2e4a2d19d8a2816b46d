The two main suspects in the murder of the Star journalist Eric Oloo on Wednesday failed to take a plea after one claimed to be sick. The two brothers Joel Franklin Luta and Victor Ogola Luta appeared before Siaya High Court judge Justice Roseline Aburili. Joel told the court that he was too unwell to continue with court proceedings and prayed that he be allowed access to medication first before responding to charges. His younger brother Victor, however, told the court that he was ready to continue. The state counsel, David Okach, however, opposed Joel's application for the deferment of plea taking, saying that he had just been from Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital for mental assessment and did not complain of any ailment. Okach said plea taking would only take a minute after which the suspect could be taken for medication. In her ruling, justice Aburili said that the accused showed signs of being unwell and could not take a plea. The judge ordered that Joel be taken to Siaya County Referral Hospital immediately and be remanded, together with his brother, until Thursday when they would take a plea. The two brothers were arrested a month ago following the murder of the correspondent with the Star. The scribe's blood-soaked body was found lying on a bed inside a house he shared with a chief inspector attached to Ugunja police station, Sabina Kerubo. Kerubo was arraigned before Siaya principal magistrate’s court but was later released after the police informed the court that they intended to use her as a prosecution witness. Oloo was buried last month at their home in Ugunja. Ugenya MP David Ochieng offered to represent the family in court. Ochieng said he has been monitoring how the police are handling the case and "if they are not vigilant, Oloo’s killers will go scot-free". "I want to assure the family that Oloo's killers will not go unpunished however connected they are. They should be imprisoned," he said. Edited by R.Wamochie
