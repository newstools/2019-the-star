Dancehall and genge artiste Larry Kasinga Kimanzi, aka Iman, has released a five-track EP titled 'African Pablo'. "This project is one of a kind with inspirations from the African culture and sounds," he said in a statement. Apart from the lead song 'African Pablo', other songs in the EP are 'Pass' ft Don Dee, 'Dora' ft Exray of Boondocks Gang, 'Sepetu' and 'Enter Body' ft Kidis. Iman, 20, had a brief stint in the school choir and started recording at KCA, where he studied Business Management. Prior to that, he established a record label and a party promotion company called Blackman Senate, which he used to promote and book shows in school. This new kid on the block promises more in 2020. "Wait for new jams come next year," he said.
