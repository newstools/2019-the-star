The Embu assembly has drafted a Bill seeking to exempt persons living with disabilities from paying fees and duties levied by the county government. The proposal also seeks the establishment of a kitty to purchase and repair assistive devices for this group. The Embu County Persons Living with Disability Bill 2019, aims to facilitate rehabilitation and to achieve equalisation of opportunities for persons with disabilities. The Bill proposes the creation of the Embu County Persons with Disability Fund, which will receive money appropriated by the County Assembly as well as grants, contributions, gifts and donations from well-wishers and donor institutions. This will among other activities encourage persons with disability to venture into small-scale enterprises through provision of affordable credit. The fund is also intended to support education programmes for persons with disabilities. This will include grant of bursaries, capacity building, awareness campaigns and support of research on disability. The pooled money will also give grants to associations for persons with disability and fund the establishment of rehabilitation centres. The Bill will also mandate the Department for Persons with Disability to work in consultation with the relevant agencies of both the national and county government to provide an integrated system of special and non-formal education with all forms of disability and setting up of Braille and recorded libraries for the blind. The department shall also be responsible for policy formulation to guard against discrimination and stigmatisation of persons with disabilities. The department is also expected to ensure a barrier-free and disability-friendly environment across the county to enable the group to easily access buildings, roads, and other social facilities. Speaker Josiah Thiriku committed the Bill to the Committee on Gender, Culture, Children and Social Affairs for the rest of the legislative proves.
