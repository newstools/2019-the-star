A Kitengela cleric has said he turned down an offer of Sh1.5 million to rig a party primary for an unpopular parliamentary candidate in Mwingi North in 2017. Daniel Mathuva of the Evangelical Christian Church of Kitengela in Kajiado county said he was offered the money in Kyuso town. Mathuwa was the Mwingi North Wiper party primaries returning officer. He said he had to make a very hard but firm decision to reject the bribe because “those who approached me were my very close kin”. Mathuva said that when he was later deployed to Nuu in Mwingi Central to supervise Wiper nominations, he had to wire back bribe money sent to his Mpesa by an aspirant. The cleric said that the bribery attempt was part of a plan to lock the current Mwingi North MP Paul Nzengu out of the parliamentary race. He said Nzengu’s nomination certificates were hidden at some point. Mathuva who is a lecturer at the African International University in Nairobi spoke at Nzengu’s rural home in Kyuso, Kitui county on Boxing Day. He was in a delegation of 50 pastors who paid the MP a visit. “I want to tell the pastors congregating here that the holy word dictates that we must be steadfast in proclaiming our stand. If it is a yes or no it should remain so without doublespeak,” he said. Mathuva said he made it clear to the persons who were out to bribe him that not only was he a pastor but had a name to protect. His conscience would not allow him to be corrupted, he said. Mathuva said that had he accepted the bribe he would have done a disservice by denying Mwingi North voters their rightful MP. “I went mad and told those who were seeking to bribe me that I was an incorruptible man of the cloth,” he added. He urged pastors to know that they have a name to protect and money id worldly and thus not eternal.
