 Vihiga contractors have asked Governor Wilber Ottichillo to pay their Sh900 million in pending bills before the year ends. They said the pending bills have been approved by the Auditor General. Through their chairman Alfred Omuka, the contractors said they used their funds to build classrooms, bridges, health centers and roads within the county but have not been paid since 2013. Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi previously said the county was already processing the payments. “We took loans from banks to do what we did. We have been auctioned yet the county is holding on to our cash. We are appealing to the governor to pay us so that we can move on with life,” Omuka said. County director for communication Victor Watende told the Star the payments were being processed through IFMIS. "We hope to clear their dues in this financial year," Wetende said. "We understand our good partners and we know their patience has grown thin, but we request them to remain calm as we process their payment.” Omuka said they voted for Ottichillo on the promise that he would settle their pending bills within 100 days. "He has turned against us and subjected us to misery and suffering," Omuka said. Omuka said it was unfortunate that contractors were kept on hold for inspection and auditing of work they had already done. “Vihiga is a small county and we don't understand why are we being troubled when it comes to payment. It’s our right. We are not begging but asking for what we worked for.” He said the Auditor-General approved their pending bills as genuine in a report released in June.  eidted by p.o
