Naivas Supermarket says nearly 39 per cent of the total volume of transactions over the past year has been cashless. The retailer, which opened its 57th store in Embu town on November 20, has been recognised as the merchant with the most card transactions by global payment services firm Visa international. Visa said Naivas had gone beyond its expectations for the use of cashless transactions over the last three years, with 1,320 card swiping machines countrywide. Naivas chief commercial officer Willy Kimani said card use in its outlets is steadily growing,  with Nairobi accounting for a significant proportion of the volume. “Kenyans increasingly prefer to use card and mobile payments for their purchases, necessitating that we move with the times and deliver seamless, speedy payment platforms that ensure they spend the least time at the till,” he said. Kimani said card transactions had grown faster than mobile payments over the past twelve months. The retailer has also made significant progress in using card payments for the e-commerce site it runs. “We expect that this would be the case since Nairobi shoppers tend to be the early adopters of these technologies,” Kimani said.
