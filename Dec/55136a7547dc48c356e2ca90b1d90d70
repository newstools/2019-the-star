Actress Nyce Wanjeri, well known for her role as Shiru in Auntie Boss, has urged social media users to stop shaming fellow humans on the platforms. Nyce recently came under attack on social media after she was mistaken for a girl in a sex video that went viral. Speaking to Word Is on Saturday, the actress denied she is the girl in the video. “That wasn’t me. I always say this. Those who know me know that Nyce is not like that," she said. "Let’s take an example of [it] if it was me. I keep on telling people this, everyone has sex. They have sex. On that particular one, it wasn’t me. Trust me, I keep my life private. “I actually talked to that lady and it's something she was going through and it was hard. When something like that goes viral, it destroys people. It feels bad that someone would name you and you were not the one. "Even if you were the one, it should not be a problem. Why are you attacking people right now? I’ll say this, women, let’s hold hands and not shame each other.” Nyce was speaking during the Kalasha Awards, where she took home the Best Lead Actress in a TV Drama Series award. She had previously won the Best Actress in a Comedy Series award at the AMVCAs in Nigeria.
