Midfielder Danson Chetambe has set his focus on a better second part of the Kenyan Premier League season after an underwhelming campaign at a personal level as well as for his club Bandari so far. Chetambe was brought in from Zoo Kericho at the end of the 2018-2019 season to give the dockers a new creative dimension and add to the goals total from midfield. The player has so far failed to live up to the expectations but he is confident things will soon change. "I know I need to improve on my first leg performance and help the team climb higher up the table. I took a little longer to adapt but I hope I will have some positive contribution to make to the team in the second leg," stated Chetambe. Goals were the hallmark of Chetambe's five-year stay at Zoo, where his triple-threat combination with Nicholas Kipkirui and Michael Madoya earned Zoo some memorable performances and won the latter two moves to Gor Mahia and Tusker respectively. A year later, Chetambe joined Bandari but goals have remained hard to come by. "I was accustomed to the surroundings at Zoo, where I was like the key player. At Bandari, there are a lot of talent but I know I am capable of playing at the level I used to do or even better," he said. In his last season at Zoo, Chetambe scored 12 goals but he is yet to find the back of the net for Bandari. He has, however, been held back by illness and missed a handful of league matches for the ambitious coastal outfit. "I feel okay now physically. Training consistently will make my situation even better," Chetambe assured. Bandari have endured a poor run this season after finishing second in the fast-tracked 2018-2019 KPL campaign. The dockers have won only four of their 13 matches to date. They have 15 points in position 11. They will resume training under coach BernardÂ  Mwalala on Monday. Bandari will be back in action next year when they host Nzoia United on January 4.
