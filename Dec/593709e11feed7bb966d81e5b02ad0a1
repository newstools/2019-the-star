Machakos county governor Alfred Mutua has accused DP William Ruto, Majority leader Aden Duale of threatening his life. Mutua who recorded a statement at the Kilimani police station on Monday, also named Elgeyo Marakwet senator Kipchumba Murkomen. Speaking outside the police station, Mutua said Duale and Murkomen had threatened him for fighting Ruto politically. "Nilishambuliwa na mweshimiwa Duale na Murkomen kwa kuniambia ya kwamba ninawashambulia. Nilipowauliza eti ninawashambulia vipi wakasema eti nimekuwa nikimshambulia Ruto," Mutua said. Mutua said on December 11 at State House, DP Ruto also shook hands with him and said that ' you have been attacking me and I have to crush you. I will teach you a lesson'. He said that the DP added that 'you wait, you will see' in presence of Duale who told him 'we warned you'. Mutua said DP's words and the tone did not mean well with him. "I was petrified not only by the words uttered by the DP Ruto but by the intensity of his eyes and angry tone of voice,"Mutua said. He, however, vowed to continue speaking the truth despite fears instilled to him by the three leaders. The governor added that his threats have been linked to his ambitions to vie for the presidency during the 2022 general elections. He said that he has shared the same remarks with his family members and other people close to him. Mutua is one of the politicians who have expressed the ambition to challenge Ruto for the State House race in 2022.
