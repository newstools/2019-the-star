The BBI report should be taken to the grassroots for Kenyans to give their views, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said. He said the BBI report is not for a chosen few but for all Kenyans. "After launch, the BBI report is open to the public to decide," Kalonzo said. He spoke during the Kakamega Forest Marathon in Chilobani, Kakamega county, on Saturday. The former Vice President said a technical committee should be constituted soon to initiate meetings at the grassroots so that people can give their views concerning the report. "Let us give every Kenyan a chance to present their views on the report so that we can have the amendments in place before 2022," he said. Kalonzo further said the Prime Minister should be powerful, not ceremonial. "As I said earlier, whoever will be chosen as the Prime Minister will earn a normal salary as a parliamentarian. He can be impeached at any time and can be sacked by the president at any time. Who would want that kind of a job? ," he said "Many people will agree with me that the Prime Minister should be given powers and responsibilities."
