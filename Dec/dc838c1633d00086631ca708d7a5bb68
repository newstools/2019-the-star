West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo has urged residents to maintain law and order during the Christmas festivities. “Lets not take advantage of the festive season and start engaging in criminal activities. Let’s remember the motive of the season and celebrate in a calm environment,” he said. The county boss urged leaders to shun decisive politics that may hinder development and distort peace. “We need to thank God for the peace we are currently enjoying. We all wanted our people to stay in peace. Let’s stop throwing the blame on issues concerning security,” he said. Lonyangapuo said security issues should not be politicised since it is sensitive and nobody wants to see communities engage in fights. West Pokot county commissioner Apollo Okello asked residents to continue preaching peace during the festive season. “We need to maintain peace so that we can attain sustainable development in areas along the border,” he said.
