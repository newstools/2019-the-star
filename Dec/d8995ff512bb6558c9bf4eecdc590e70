Reigning champions Lawrence Cherono will return to defend his Boston Marathon crown next year. Cherono won the 2019 race by two seconds over two-time winner Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia in a thrilling climax . Cherono, who also bagged the Chicago Marathon title in October, will be up against 2018 winner Yuki Kawauchi of Japan, 2017 winner Kenyan Geoffrey Kirui and 2013 and 2015 winner Desisa. “Boston will have a special place in my memories forever,” said Cherono, who has won eight marathons, most recently Chicago in October. “I loved every mile of this race and fought until the end to achieve the first place and become part of the elite family to have won the most prestigious race of the world,”added Cherono Cherono said he is relishing the challenge of competing against the world best in Boston. “It will be tough but I am ready to face the world's best. I have started my training and hope to be in peak condition by the time we go to Boston,” he added. In the women's category, Worknesh Degefa will return to defend her crown but faces stiff test from a competitive field. Degefa will be up against Kenyan duo of Caroline Rotich, who won the event in 2015 and 2017 champion Edna Kiplagat. Home favourite Des Linden  won in 2018 and will be hoping to upset the favourites for the event. Locally, Linden’s appearance will warrant considerable attention, coming less than eight weeks after racing at the USA Olympic Team Trials Marathon on February 29. “At this point in my career, I enter each race with a heightened sense of urgency and I have become very selective in what races I'm willing to commit my time and energy to,” said Linden, 36, a two-time Olympian. “The Boston Marathon has always been the most motivating race on my schedule. I hope to stand on the start line in Hopkinton as the first US woman to have made three Olympic Marathon teams.”
