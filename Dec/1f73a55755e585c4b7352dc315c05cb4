Investments management firmÂ Cytonn Group on Tuesday launched the first regulated and specialised investment scheme at Sarova Panafric Hotel. The scheme, focused on financing mid- to low-income housing, is known as Cytonn High Yield Fund. PS Charles Hinga said that he was happy that Cytonn has decided to come up with such a scheme since land in Kenya is said to be the most expensive in the continent. " I am very happy that Cytonn Group has come up with the Investment Scheme this is because it will be able to cater to middle-class people. We all know that a piece of land here in Kenya is not cheap in fact our country is said to be the most expensive when purchasing a piece of land," PS said.
