The Dock Workers Union has proposed measures they believe will stop cartels controlling state corporations. DWU general secretary Simon Sang on Sunday told the Star victimisation of holders of top positions in state corporations would not end as long as the appointments are political. He said cartels, who benefit from the appointments through dubious deals, will continue to hold sway and sacrifice those who do not tow their line. “You have seen what is currently happening to KPA managing director Daniel Manduku and his chief officers. “It is not about them being corrupt but about state corporations being made cash cows by and for the cartels of this country,” Sang said. He called for the passing and implementation of Government Owned Entities Bill of 2014. The Bill has been gathering dust in Parliament’s shelves for five years. “It is through this Bill that airtight measures can be put in place in a state corporation to professionalise its service delivery,” said Sang. The Bill was intended to streamline governance of state corporations by instilling professionalism. “In my view, this is the only solution to what we are seeing today in state corporations,” said Sang. He said cartels at the Mombasa port had increased in number and become more ambitious, aggressive and forceful dictating who to work with and who to discard at the facility. Last Thursday, the giant union said troubled Manduku and his co-accused were victims of the cartels, paying the price for their lack of cooperation. Manduku has been under investigation over procurement irregularities. He has moved to the High Court seeking anticipatory orders which to protect him against arrest, citing interference of the investigations. He said the office of the DCI had overstepped its mandate by investigating matters which should be investigated by the EACC. Judge Erick Ogola said he would rule on the matter on December 17. Sang said in most cases cartels have a hand in appointments.
