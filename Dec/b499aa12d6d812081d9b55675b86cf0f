A boda boda operator was on Wednesday night murdered and his motorcycle stolen by two suspects he had ferried from Naivasha town. The body was found dumped in Site estate by members of the public who reported to the police. The victim who operated around Naivasha town was killed using a blunt object before the suspects escaped using his motorcycle. The incident sparked protest by the riders who called on police to hasten their investigations and bring the culprits to book. According to rider Daniel Kiarie, the two suspects had sought the man's services before turning against him. Kiarie said the town had recorded low levels of crime this year, and the incident surprised them. He said that there were signs of injuries on the man's head with bloodstains on a nearby stone which they suspected he was bludgeoned with. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said that an inquest file had been opened for the murdered man. Waweru called on anyone with any information to volunteer it to the police. “We have intensified security in and around the town and we believe it’s a matter of time before we catch up with the suspects,” he said. The senior officer said that they had intensified security in and around the town ahead of the festive season. He said that a special security team encompassing all uniformed officers had been formed and was patrolling the town. “We want to assure visitors and area residents that Naivasha is very safe as we have increased our patrols in and around the town,” he said.
