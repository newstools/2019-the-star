The High Court has extended orders that suspended a notice increasing parking fees within Nairobi’s Central Business District and Kijabe Street. Justice James Makau said there should be no more parking fee hike until the case filed against it is heard and determined. He directed the parties to file submissions before hearing on February 17. The new charges were to come into effect on December 4. City Hall issued a public notice dated December 2 increasing the fees from the current Sh200 to Sh400. Buses that are not public service vehicles were to pay Sh1,000 daily. The notice was signed by county parking services director Tom Tinega. However, the Consumer Federation of Kenya, through lawyer Henry Kurauka, protested the decision, arguing it would hurt consumers seeking transport and parking services within the area. Hence, early this month, Justice Makau announced the suspension. Makau said the petition by Cofek raises constitutional issues that ought to be determined by the court. Kurauka had argued that if the proposed changes were implemented, the rights of consumers would be greatly violated even as they struggle with the high cost of living. “There is no reasonable cause to increase parking fees at a time when most consumers are struggling to provide basic amenities for their families such as food, housing, healthcare, school fees, clothing, fuel, airtime, transport and expenses for other important social activities,” he said. The organisation also noted that the decision requiring buses to pay more to access the city centre would cause a ripple effect and result in raised fares, which would hurt commuters’ travel plans this holiday season. Cofek said the county government had not ensured the security of vehicles, adding that it had received numerous consumer complaints of increased insecurity in the designated parking zones. It added that security services had been assigned to parking boys.
