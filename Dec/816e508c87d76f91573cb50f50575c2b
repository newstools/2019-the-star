A man was arraigned on Tuesday in Milimani, Nairobi, for allegedly biting a police officer’s ear while resisting arrest. The court heard that Peter Kanogi, alias Tosi, bit Munuku Kitavi's right earlobe and punched him on the lower lip. Kitavi also suffered bruises to his hands. His colleague intervened. Tosi denied any wrongdoing. The offence was allegedly committed at the Tsavo-Accra Road junction in Nairobi on December 8. The officer was on patrol as an anti-mugging undercover after an alert by members of the public. Kitavi was tipped that Tosi was chasing another man while armed with a kitchen knife with the motive to stab him. The suspect was cornered. Tosi pleaded for lenient bond terms. Principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot granted him Sh200,000 bail or alternative Sh600,000 bond. The case will be mentioned on December 24.
