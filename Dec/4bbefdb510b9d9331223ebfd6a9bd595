Former Coast Parliamentary Group chairman Gunga Mwinga and former Bamba MCA Daniel Mangi are leading former politicians in demystifying the BBI report. Speaking to the media on Wednesday in Kilifi, Mwinga said elected leaders from the Coast have failed to bring leaders together and come up with a common stand on the report's recommendations. They rely on leaders from other regions to read the document and decide for them, he said. “It is shameful if we cannot give our people the way forward on the document. Most of our leaders are waiting for the voices of the leaders they support so that they can echo them." Mwinga is coordinating former MPs while Mangi is coordinating former MCAs. Mangi said already leaders from Lamu, Tana River, Taita Taveta, Kilifi and Kwale counties have shown interest in the conference to be held in two weeks. “We have experts who will guide us on matters that may not be clear to us. We expect over 200 leaders to attend," Mangi said. He urged leaders to take time and go through the report. “Let us not wait for [ODM leader] Raila [Odinga] and [Deputy President Willam] Ruto to read the report for us. We must read it and understand, then we make recommendations as a region. This is the time for us to come together and make sure all our concerns are factored into the document that will definitely shape the course the country is going to take." Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi and his Mombasa counterpart Hassan Joho have remained noncommittal about the document. The two are considered Coast’s political kingpins. Edited by R.Wamochie
