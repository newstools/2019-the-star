The annual Lamu Cultural Festival is set for next week. This will be the 19th edition of the festival that will cost Sh6 million. Last year's budget was about Sh13 million, said Ghalib Alwy, chairman of the Lamu Cultural Promotional Group. But hard economic times are not expected to dampen the enthusiasm. Unlike previous years when the festival is held every November, this year’s edition will run from December 12 to 16. Acting Tourism CEC Fahima Arafat said preparations are in top gear. She said at least 30,000 guests are expected in Lamu town for the festival. The Lamu Cultural Festival was launched in 2000 and is held in Lamu Old Town, a historical town listed as a Unesco World Heritage site in 2001. The fete showcases the rich culture and heritage of Lamu’s Swahili communities.  It is preceded by various competitions led by the donkey race, swimming, dhow races and a combination of traditional dances. “Due to the harsh economic times, we have decided to limit the budget for this year’s fete to Sh6 million. The cash is ready,” Arafat said. She praised the national government for ensuring speedy completion of the Lamu-Garsen Road, saying many visitors will use the 135-kilometre road to get to Lamu for the festival. “We are already witnessing an increase in the number of public transport vehicles and even shuttles and private vehicles using the road as the construction nears completion." The Lamu county government is the major sponsor of the festival, supported by the Kenya Tourism Board, Magical Kenya, the Kenya Ports Authority and the National Museums of Kenya, among others. The festival is renowned for its economic returns in good times. Tourism stakeholders and traders are looking forward to reaping profits. Tour guide Ali Mlowe said the festival will restore the confidence of tourists and visitors in the region that had been branded a terror zone due to previous Shabaab attacks. Edited by R.Wamochie
