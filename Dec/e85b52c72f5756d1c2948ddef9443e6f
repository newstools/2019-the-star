Kabras Head coach Hennley Du Plessis hailed his side fortitude in defence for the 19-6 victory over champions KCB at the Lions Den in Ruaraka. It was the Kakamega-based side's first-ever victory over the bankers in 10 meetings and the South African tactician was delighted, saying: "Credit to our defence. They put in a big shift. We did not allow their forwards to get over the advantage  line, restricting them to just six points.” However, Du Plessis said they will not get carried away by the victory since they still have a long way to the end of the campaign. "It's a big psychological win but the season is still young and we need to build on this victory for the remainder of the season," noted Du Plessis Ugandan 15s skipper Asman Mugerwa scored a brace with Fijian Timoci Sinaite scoring one try as compatriot Jone Kubu adding two conversions. Kabras led 12-3 at the interval. Levi Amunga kicked over two penalties for the bankers in a match that saw referee Victor Oduor temporarily stop proceedings due to a heavy downpour. Kabras remain the only undefeated side in the top flight. The win saw the millers open a four-point lead over the bankers with 29. Homeboyz move up to third place on 24 points after an ill-tempered, bonus-point win over Blak Blad at Kenyatta University. Impala Saracens lost ground on the top three after blowing away 20-3 half-time lead to lose 30-20 against Nakuru at the latter's backyard. The Sarries are joint fourth on the log with Mwamba on 20 points. Mwamba ground a tough 15-13 victory over Quins at the RFUEA. Kenya Under 20 international George Mutuku scored a last-minute penalty to seal the win for the visitors. Oilers are placed seventh after a 27-3 victory over Nondies at the Nakuru showground to end their three-match winless streak. Western Bulls are eighth following a 23-5 win over Kisumu RFC. The Nyanza-based side are bottom of the log with four points.
