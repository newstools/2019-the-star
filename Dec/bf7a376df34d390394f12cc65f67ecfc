Kitui county government has no justification to hide behind EACC investigations to decline paying 81 contractors awarded Sh1.1 billion owed since 2016, their lawyer has said. James Mbugua said there was no justification whatsoever for the county government to have not paid the distraught contractors more than three years upon completion of the projects they were given. In the letter addressed  to Treasury CS Ukur Yattani as well as the Kitui  county secretary Joshua  Chepchieng,  Mbugua  wondered  why contractors  had not  been paid long after the EACC gave the green light. Mbugua  quoted  letter  from the EACC to acting county secretary Alex Kimanzi  dated 18th May, 2018 allowing  payments to the contractors even as investigations got underway. “EACC stated as follows:[w]e wish to advise the Commission has no objection to you [the County Secretary, Kitui] paying the contractors for the work done as long as the payment is lawful and is done in accordance with the requirement of the Public Finance Management Act, Public Procurement and Disposal Act and any other relevant legislation or regulation,” the lawyer’s letter says. Mbugua said that the 81 contractors were demanding that Kitui county government be put in the list of contractors who had failed to honour pending bills as instructed by President Uhuru Kenyatta. He said Treasury should cease disbursing funds to the Kitui county government. The advocate said his clients were demanding the immediate payment of the total sum of money they are owed by the county government of Kitui. However, the  county  three  weeks ago said  its hands  were tied because  all the related tender documents  were carted away by EACC. Acting treasury executive Ben Katungi said the contractors would have to wait until the EACC returned the documents. He was reacting to complaints of delayed payment raised by the contractors.
