Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko failed to turn up during this year's 56th Jamhuri Day fete at the Nyayo National Stadium despite the celebrations being held in his county. Sonko had earlier on Thursday sent a message expressing his pleasure in joining Kenyans during the celebrations. "I am happy to join the rest of Kenyans in marking the 56th Jamhuri Day celebrations," he tweeted. The embattled governor said Jamhuri day reminded Kenyans of the power of independence. He said it was important for everyone to fight for their rightful position in society and all spheres of life. "To all Nairobi residents and Kenyans at large I wish y'all a happy Jamhuri Day," he said. By press time, the governor's communication team was yet to respond to texts on the governor's attendance. The celebrations are being led by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Others in attendance are Deputy President William Ruto, Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen among others. This is the first time the event is being held at the newly refurbished Nyayo Stadium. Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley will be the special guest, she will deliver her message as President Uhuru Kenyatta leads the occasion set to be attended by over 30,000 people. The event will feature military parades by the three divisions of the Kenya Defence Forces â€“ the Army, Navy and Air Force. High ranking government officials including Deputy President William Ruto will accompany President Kenyatta to the national event at Nyayo and thereafter a State reception at State House. The event will also be graced by special envoys and foreign diplomats stationed in Nairobi. Surinamese Foreign Minister Pollack Beighle will represent the South American nation. Sonko was freed on Wednesday evening after he posted Sh15 million bail but has been barred from accessing his office. He was also barred from commenting about the case on social media.
