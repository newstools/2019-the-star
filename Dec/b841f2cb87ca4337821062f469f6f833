We will soon bid bye to 2019, the year many contend was a very difficult one. In part, this was due to the shrinking buying power of the majority, exacerbated by maturing loans that gobble quite a huge part of our revenue and long term projects whose economic benefits will take too long to realise. While the problems arising from the external factors may be hard to change, we must deal with the pilferage in the public sector rather than spending a fortune to chase after those who have misused or stolen public resources. Prosecuting those who misuse their offices to rob the public is good, but conviction will be key in instilling the much-needed discipline. Even more important will be looking at our laws, policies and regulations which seem to abet or aid corruption and other economic crimes. This should be done with a view not to change them but to strengthen or fully implement them. We are yet to fully back accountability measures with practicable action plans. Cronyism, friendship, tribalism and nepotism still play great roles in securing potential employees any job in government institutions and departments. Such practices further corruption, as the people employed, owe their allegiance first the person who secured them the opportunities rather than the citizens. They act as gatekeepers and are often ready to do as ordered by their bosses. But even in cases where people are competitively employed, in a country where securing a job is arduous and the juniors work at the behest of their corrupt seniors, the former are either inducted to this thieving or are intimidated and finally sacked on trumped-up allegations when they try to resist. This relationship must be relooked at so that while work must be done and span of control respected, the juniors who are the executors of the mind-boggling thefts, some on behalf of their seniors are protected but made to account for their actions or inactions.
