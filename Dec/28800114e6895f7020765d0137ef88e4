The Ministry of Transport organised a forum on November 25 at the Radisson Blu hotel in Nairobi where stakeholders had an opportunity to elaborate their infrastructural projects through the Nairobi Metropolitan Services Improvement Project. The event was attended by Transport CS James Macharia. The objective of the project is to transform Nairobi and its four neighbouring counties—Kiambu, Kajiado, Machakos and Murang’a—into a sustainable world-class African metropolis that is safe, secure and prosperous.
