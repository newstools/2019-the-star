Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha is set to release the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education today. This comes after the Kenya National Examinations Council's Board approved the results on Monday. Magoha is expected to brief President Uhuru Kenyatta on the results at the State House before being made public. A total of 699,745 students sat for this year's examinations which were concluded on November 27. The 14-day marking process started on November 28 and came to an end on December 12 and Knec officials started to analyse the results. The marking process war marred by protest as markers demanded better pay. The 2019 KCSE results come three days earlier than 2018 where results were released on December 21. The cases of cheating in this year are expected to reduce after the government said it had sealed all the loopholes during the exams. Magoha had said that the state had discovered the strategies mostly used by those involved in examinations malpractices. They include the usage of mobile phones, impersonation, leakage of exam papers, teachers writing answers on papers and passing them to candidates and centre managers compromising those involved in the process including security personnel. Last year, Juliet Otieno from Pangani Girls topped KCSE list scoring 87.6 points, closely followed Kaluna James of Maseno School with 87.3 points. In 2018, male candidates dominated the list of top 100 exam performers.
