 A Homa Bay county lobby group has warned secondary school principals against increasing school fees ahead of Form One students’ admissions in January. The Homa Bay Education Network is apprehensive that some school heads would invent "unwarranted" methods of milking money from parents. The network's coordinator, Julius Omuga, claimed at the weekend that some principals planned to increase fees by more than 70 per cent. “This organisation has realised that many secondary school principals have invented ways of milking cash from parents by creating unnecessary levies. We’re opposed to the methods,” Omuga told journalists in Homa Bay town. He identified some of the planned methods as selling uniforms in schools expensively and introduction of remedial lessons. “I know of a school in Homa Bay which charges Sh27,000 for school uniforms among other levies,” the coordinator said, adding that such principals will deny children of poor parents from accessing education. “Parents should be cushioned from unnecessary levies. Let them give the correct description of uniforms in calling letters to enable parents to purchase them at affordable prices in shops of their choice.” Omuga, who is a board member of the Elimu Yetu Coalition, an organisation that advocates for affordable education in Kenya, said they have a free hotline – 0800720940 – for parents to report unfair fees increases. The coordinator urged the Ministry of Education to stop the exploitation of parents by some school principals. On Friday, Education CS George Magoha said: "No child should be sent home for infrastructural development money." Magoha said the 2020 fees guidelines remain enforced and action would be taken against any school going to the contrary. He was addressing Mt Kenya University’s 17th graduation ceremony in Thika. He told parents to only pay school fees as set by the ministry.
