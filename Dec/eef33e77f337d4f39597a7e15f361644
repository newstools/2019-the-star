Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has failed to appear before the Voi Law Court due to health complications. Sonko was to appear before the court to face charges of resisting arrest on December 6. The governor was ordered to appear before the court on January 21, 2020. The governor has also been accused of 'kicking' Coast Regional Commander Rashid Yakubu on the thigh during his arrest at Ikanga strip. In a charge sheet dated December 9, Sonko has been charged for assaulting the police officer at 12.30 pm in the due execution of his duties contrary to section 103 of the National Police Service Act 2011. The witnesses have been listed are Rashid Yakubu, CJs James Mwanzia, Michael Muriithi, CPL Fred Sabai, CPL Stephen Mtawa, PC Ibrahim Ahmed and others to State. A doctor’s report presented before the court and seen by the Star indicate that Sonko is suffering from hypertension and chest pain. “He was diagnosed with hypertensive urgency, soft tissue injury to the left chest wall and bilateral hip osteoarthritis. He had no previous history of hypertension. He continues to be on bed rest with close blood pressure monitoring,” lawyer George Kithi told the court. Kithi said that the governor would personally appear before the court in January as ordered. The governor is also facing other 19 charges of corruption, abuse of office and irregular payments that saw the county lose Sh357 million in Nairobi. Earlier, security had been beefed up around the court with contingents of police manning the gates to control swelling crowds that waited to welcome the governor. A number of Nairobi County MCAs also attended the court session.
