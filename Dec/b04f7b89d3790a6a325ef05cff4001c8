Sixty years after its introductions, Zebra crossing is evolving due to safety fears. The black-and-white striped pedestrian crossing was designed to help pedestrians to cross the road. In most cases, Pedestrians just storm onto the road when vehicles are on the move making motorists to step on their brakes and wait for them to pass. Zebra crossing was officially introduced to Britain's roads, the zebra has evolved in a manner that now most crossings are not only white and black but also other colours. Now the original black-and-white striped pedestrian crossing, is only adornment and is nearing extinction. In Kenya, most crossings have been changed from zebra stripes to maroon and white. Especially here in Westlands where its no longer the white and black stripes. As you walk along West-gate area, you will notice that the stripes have changed to maroon and white. This has been used to improve the visibility of motorists and also pedestrians. But not only the stripes have been used but also in some streets in Kenya's capital city , actual Zebra's drawn on the ground have been used. As you walk along Kenyatta Avenue in Nairobi, you will spot different things in different places within the city. Some artists went ahead to paint the crossings through art in a bid to  inspire people and attract tourists during this festive season. Through #MyMarkMyCity, some artists said they have joined hands to beautify the streets of Nairobi. Crosswalks have included unique designs, many of which take the form of artwork. These works of art may serve many different purposes, such as attracting tourism or catching drivers' attention. Cities and towns worldwide have held competitions to paint crosswalks, usually as a form of artwork. In Santiago, a 2013 work by Canadian artist Roadsworth features yellow-and-blue fish overlaid on the existing crosswalk. Other crossings worldwide also feature some of Roadsworth's work.
