A woman was yesterday charged in a Milimani court for obtaining money by false pretense. She is accused of pretending that she was a doctor at Aga Khan Hospital and could make medical equipment deliveries to the hospital. Carolyne Kinya is accused of obtaining Sh939,000 from three different people within Nairobi county. In the first count, she is said to have obtained Sh558,300 from Bernadett Wairimu Njoroge by saying she was in a position to supply gloves, surgical equipment and other equipment to the hospital, which was false. In two other counts, she is said to have obtained Sh160,000 and Sh221,000 from Karen Gathoni and Nancy Waithira on December 7 and 17, respectively. Kinya is said to have claimed that she would deliver the medical equipment to Aga Khan Hospital gynaecology clinic on their behalf. She denied all the charges before senior principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot. She sought to be released on lenient bail and bond terms, saying she is from a humble background. The magistrate released Kinya on a Sh500,000 bond or Sh100,000 bail. The matter will be mentioned on December 24.
