A police officer who beat up and broke the left rib of a Baringo secondary school teacher has been sentenced to three years probation. Shredrack Oracha (currently interdicted) was found guilty of molesting and beating up Tangulbei Secondary School teacher Mark Lochomoluk in December 2017. “I reached at the sentence as per the probation report that the accused person is a first-time offender,” Kabarnet resident magistrate Viennah Amboko said on Wednesday. The incident occurred at Chemoling’ot Administration Police camp in Tiaty subcounty where Lochomoluk was locked up for staying out late. “The probation officers also gave a positive report about the accused person’s conduct, therefore, I order in my view that he may be rehabilitated within the community,” Amboko said. Oracha was given 14 days to appeal the judgement. In his mitigation, Oracha pleaded for leniency, saying he is an orphan and also the breadwinner of the family. Lochomoluk opposed the sentence, saying the accused might easily find a chance to pursue and harm him. “I think some jail time could have been better for the accused so it could as serve an example to the warlike and arrogant officers,” Lochomoluk said. The Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers Baringo branch secretary Philip Kimosop said the sentence did not match the magnitude of the beating. “But all is not lost.  We will still stand in solidarity with the teacher to consult widely then make an appeal to ensure the case is reviewed and see to it that our member gets justice and full compensation,” Kimosop said.
