 An MP has called for the resignation of a deputy county commissioner following the swapping of sewing machines meant for the disabled with stones. Nominated lawmaker MP Dennitah Ghati wants Likuyani deputy county commissioner Wilson Kimayio t take responsibility for the theft of the machines. “In my capacity as MP, I am wondering what happened to humanity. How can such a thing happen to persons with disabilities right in the office of law enforcers?” Ghati said. She spoke to the Star on the phone on Wednesday from Kampala where she is attending the East African Legislative Assembly games. Ghati said people living with disabilities were a vulnerable group and that the theft of donations meant for them was very dehumanising. Police are investigating how the sewing machines donated by the National Fund for the Disabled (NFD-K) were swapped with stones in a government office. On Monday, Kimayio said all employees had recorded statements in connection with the incident. Three disabled people on Thursday received their sewing machines from Kimayio’s office but were shocked when they reached home and opened the well-packaged cartons only to find stones. Other applicants had received their machines and other tools they had applied for but the three could not be reached and their kits were kept at the commissioner’s office. Ghati who represents people living with disabilities in the National Assembly said that law enforcers are supposed to protect the vulnerable and not humiliate and dehumanise them. “If offices were not broken into then heads must roll,” Ghati said. She said the incident was an inside job and arrests should have been made already. NFD-K chief executive Alex Mutegi said the fund was not guilty of any wrongdoing. “What was affected is what we left at the Likuyani deputy county commissioner's office and that is being handled at that level,” Mutegi said on Monday.  edited by p. obuya
