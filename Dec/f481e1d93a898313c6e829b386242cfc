Airtel Kenya has launched no expiry data and call rates that will allow customers to spend as low as 1 bob for 5MB data and to make calls at Sh2 across all networks. Airtel’s Managing Director Prasanta Sarma said the new products campaign dubbed ‘BeSureNaAirtel’ is pegged on showing customers the exact rates and value they get for their investment. At the same time, the company also revamped its entire data bundle offerings to give more data for the same cost as before. Three GB will go for for Sh300 up from 1.5GB, 5GB for Sh500 up from 4GB and 12GB for Sh1,000 up from 10GB with 30 days validity. The new offerings are targeted towards customers who are looking to meet their communication needs, Sarma said during the launch on Monday. To activate the new rates, customers need to dial *544*2#. “We are pleased to introduce the industry’s best no expiry rates for data and voice to all our customers,"  Sarma  said. He expressed his confidence that the new rates and revamped bundles will meet all the communication needs of Airtel’s customers even with as low airtime balance as Sh1. This comes weeks after its rival Safaricom said its users will now be able to buy data bundles with no expiry date. Safaricom CEO Michael Joseph made the announcement during Safaricom's 19th anniversary. He unveiled the new system dubbed ‘Simple. Transparent. Honest.’ When a user wants to buy data using *544#, it brings four options: Data bundle (no expiry date), Calls and SMS (No expiry date), Normal data bundle with expiry and Check balance. This comes after lawyer Adrian Kamotho sued telecommunication operators for irregularly depriving consumers of their unused data bundles.
