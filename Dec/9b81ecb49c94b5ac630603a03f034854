The Kenya Wildlife Services has identified one of the suspects seen in a viral video last month butchering an elephant in Imenti Forest in Meru county. The video circulated widely on social media platforms on November 19 this year. KWS assistant director in charge of Eastern Conservation area Michael Wanjau on Monday in Nanyuki town said that Kenneth Baabu Muthaura was positively identified and arrested. Baabu was later charged with killing an elephant in a Nanyuki court. He denied killing the elephant on June 21, 2018. Baabu was before resident magistrate Vincent Masivo. He was released on Sh300,000 bond. The case will be mentioned in January 2020. “We managed to trace him to his home in Meru where he was positively identified by local elders and relatives as one of the persons seen in the video killing the elephant on June 21 last year,” Wanjau said. The KWS assistant director further revealed that 10 other suspects also identified from the video were being sought and would soon be arrested. Wanjau sadu investigations revealed that the incident took place on June 21, 2018, when a report was made of an elephant that had been killed by villagers in Imenti Forest. “Our officers responded to the call by area chief and recovered tusks. The animal had been hacked to death with axes and pangas. Some of its flesh was shared out among the villagers,” he added. Wanjau said KWS officers took bone samples from the carcass for DNA to match the tusks. This will be presented as evidence in court.
