US based tech firm, GetMyBoat has launched the first  boat hailing app at the Kenyan Coast. It is looking to capitalize on the festive season to make headway in the Kenyan market. “While many tourists visit Kenya for on-land safaris, there are still many great water adventures too and we wanted to capture that market and make it as easy as possible to get out on the water,” the firm’s head of marketing said Valerie Streif said. This, the firm says, will eliminate the hassle of being mobbed by boat owners and touts out to sell you a boat ride at the beach. The boat-hailing app that was launched in San Fransisco in 2013 currently has 130,000 boat rentals and water experience listings in 184 countries. “It started because we noticed how many boats go unused in docks and marinas and they knew how many people wanted to go boating, but couldn't access it,” Streif said. In Kenya, the firm which started operations this year, already has 94 boat listings with plans to expand further once the business picks up pace. So far, the firm’s most popular offerings include fishing charters and private boat rentals for family parties and gatherings with friends on vacation.
