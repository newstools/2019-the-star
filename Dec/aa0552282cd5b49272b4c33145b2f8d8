Following a series of disappointing displays at past championships, Eglay Nalianya will be hoping to make amends as she hunts for a ticket to next year's Africa Athletics Championships and Tokyo Olympic Games. The 23-year-old has never been on the medal bracket despite gracing several international championships since her breakthrough in the junior ranks in 2012. “I have never been on the podium since I started my career but I am hoping to put this to an end come next year. I also felt disappointed after failing to compete for Kenya at the World Championships in Doha this year, following a fourth-place finish in the trials,” said Nalianya, who crashed out in the heats during the 2019 All Africa Games. The 800m specialist is training for both the two-lap race and 1,500m as she seeks to increase her chances of winning a medal in Tokyo. “I have learnt a lot since 2015 when I started elite running. I hope this experience will finally pay off with a medal at either of next year's championships,” said Nalianya. She revealed that she has been strict with her training regime, even with little monitoring and is keen to keep that determination heading into what appears to be a busy year ahead. “Previously, I have made mistakes by failing to thoroughly follow my programme but I am eager to end that. Remember the mess I made during the World Relays in Japan? It was a silly mistake,” said Nalianya, who stepped off the track in the third change over of the newly-introduced 2x2x400m relay.
