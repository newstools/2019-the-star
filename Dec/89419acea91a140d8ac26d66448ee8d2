Residents of Garashi location in Kilifi have urged the county to put up a social hall for men and women at the Garashi chief’s camp so they would have a place to shelter during annual flooding. For four consecutive years, they have been displaced by the floods when River Sabaki overflows and floods their homes. They are forced to spend weeks at the chief's camp with or without tents. “We cannot rely on donors every time to provide us with tents. A well-established social hall for men and women could end our suffering," they said in a statement. Area chief Chula Ndudhi has proposed a hall in their ward development committee meetings. He said more than 6,000 people from the same location were displaced last year and emphasised that a large social hall with space for men and women could be more ideal for the area. “We need to seek a lasting solution for the floods victims who get displaced every year and come here to sleep in the open until donors come to their aid and provide them with tents. "We are currently putting up houses for the police through CDF which have partly assisted the victims but when security officers are brought as we were promised, we will have nowhere to keep them,” he said. Chula revealed that his camp has a total of 6-acres, where the hall can be put up. More than 3,000 people have been affected by the floods and are being hosted in some donated tents at the chief’s camp, while more than 6,000 people were hosted last year. (Edited by V. Graham)
