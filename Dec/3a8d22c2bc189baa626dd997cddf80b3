World Safari Rally champion and eye glasses firm Optica founder Bharat Bhardwaj was on Friday cremated at the Hindu Crematorium in Kariokor, Nairobi. Bhardwaj died on Tuesday at the Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi after a short illness at the age of 75. Family and friends described him at the prayer ceremony held at MD Bhavan, Arya Samaj in Parklands, Nairobi as a great friend, cook, and sportsman who did a lot for the community. “I met him in 2003 and at that time we were discussing how to transform motorsports in Kenya. He made a lot of contributions to sports and I also had the opportunity of meeting him in his Muthaiga home in 2013 and was inspired by the beauty of his home. He was indeed a great man,” Kenya Motorsport Foundation Chairman Phineas Kimathi said. Kimathi assured mourners and the sports fraternity that his legacy will not be left out. In 1978, he was instrumental in bringing the World Rally Championship (WRC) to Kenya which help attract one million dollars (Sh 100 million) sponsorship and a Hillclimb winner for six straight years. He was one of the founders of the Kenya Motor Sports club and East Africa club as well. He was also the founder of Optica (eye care industry) which started 58 years ago after working in Kenyatta National Hospital as an optometrist voluntarily for 20 years. He was escorted by four rally drivers to the funeral.
