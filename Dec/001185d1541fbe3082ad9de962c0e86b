The lifeless body of Japheth Mwaniki was discovered by fellow students hanging by a rope around his neck and hands. He was dressed in a black hoodie, blue jeans and black sneakers. Mwaniki was a micro-biology student at the university located in Kesses, Eldoret. Monica Mungai, the mother to the deceased told the press that she only learnt of the death of his son through pictures of the hanging body posted on social media.
