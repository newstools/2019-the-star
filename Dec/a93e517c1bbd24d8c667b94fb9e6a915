Buy your mothers water tanks as Christmas gifts, Government spokesperson Cyrus Oguna says amid floods in the country. Addressing the media on Tuesday, Oguna said this will enable many people  harvest the rainwater caused by the ongoing rains. Already 132 people have  lost their lives and 17,000 people displaced from their homes by the heavy rains. "For this month of Christmas, please take it upon yourself to buy your mother a water tank as a Christmas gift, for those who have not done that,"he said Oguna said each individual should take initiative instead of waiting for the government to do its part. "Ensure that they are able to trap and store that water for future use," he said. Noting that 300,000 people have been affected by the flood, Oguna said 10 counties have been adversely affected. These are; Mandera, Wajir, Marsabit, Turkana, Garissa, Lamu, Tana River, Kwale, Mombasa and West Pokot. "Kenya National Highways Authority has been working to restore destroyed roads and bridges and providing an alternative route in affected areas," he said. Oguna said the government has issued 200 bags of rice,560 bags of beans and 1,000 bales of fortified food to landslide victims in West Pokot. The government has also appealed to Kenyans of goodwill to provide construction materials to the families affected by floods. His remarks come as more areas continue to witness landslides, including Muranga and Kapsiekwa village in Elgeiyo Marakwet. The heavy rains have rendered many roads in Nairobi impassible as they are marooned by floods.
