Taurus' Ivlyn Mutua has released her debut Christmas album, titled "12 Beats Of Christmas." The album, which is exclusively on Songa, is a combination of original and cover songs. She told Word Is, "We borrowed the concept from the 12 days of Christmas. I chose to interpret that in my own way, so there is a song for every day till Christmas." Adding, "We have released the whole album and then people will get to bond with the music as they go. Every song is different and it talks to different people. The way we've arranged the album, it goes from party mood all the way to Christmas." The singer has incorporated different genres into her amazing work of art. "I have done seven covers and five original songs. There is Mary's Boychild ft Wyre, it's a dancehall cover," she said. "The twist to the album was not to do the usual old ways. I put reggae, benga and added some flavour creatively so that it stands out. It is all about changing the culture." She has collaborated with a number of big names in the music industry, including, Fena Gitu, Trina Mungai, Atemi, Mordecai, Mbithi, Sage and Wyre. "I have Jingle Bells as reggae, Feliz Navidad in salsa and SilentÂ Night in Rnb," she said. "The original songs are mindblowing. I also did a song called Missing You, for people who are stressed or depressed or coping with grief so that they may handle that situation in a positive way. We need to celebrate knowing that Jesus is the reason for the season." Mutua says the journey to making the album started as a challenge. "I remember in July, I wanted to put out an EP but I was told to give out a Christmas album because I was hungry to work," she said. "Something that's very unique and that was a challenge. It's not about how pretty you are as an artiste but the work and craft of putting out proper music. "I had two months to work on 12 songs. I really prayed and God gave me the right people to work with."
