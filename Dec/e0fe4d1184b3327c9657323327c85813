Ugenya MP David Ochieng has offered to represent the family of murdered journalist Eric Oloo to ensure his killers rot in jail. The Star journalist was found dead in the house of Ugunja Chief Inspector Sabina Kerubo on November 21. Two suspects have been arraigned as the whereabouts of another three remain unclear, despite the police claiming to have arrested them. MP Ochieng said he has been monitoring how the police are behaving with Oloo’s case and if they are not vigilant Oloo’s killers will go scot-free. "I want to assure the family that Oloo's killers will not go unpunished however connected they are. They will have to rot in jail," he said. The lawmaker eulogised Oloo as a journalist who had good writing prowess, hence they cannot allow his untimely death caused by selfish individuals to go unpunished. He spoke on Saturday during Oloo’s funeral service at his home in Ugunja. Also present was Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi. Wandayi said they will not allow civilians to meet their end in houses of those entitled by law to protect lives and property. He demanded a total overhaul of Ugunja police personnel, including their bosses, saying they have proved beyond reasonable doubts that they are sleeping on their jobs. Oloo’s murder is so serious that they will use all means possible to secure justice for the family, Wandayi said. He urged Ugunja police officers to ensure credible investigations before they invite their seniors from Nairobi in the case. "Yesterday, I missed the Director of Criminal Investigations by a whisker as he was in a meeting, but on Monday, I will bring to his attention how Ugunja and Siaya police are joking with Oloo’s murder," Wandayi said. He regretted the rise in crime in Ugunja and castigated the police for escalating the situation. "I will not tire until all perpetrators of Oloo’s murder are brought to book. We can’t be rotating around the same issue of insecurity without a solution in Ugunja," Wandayi vowed.
