The Kirinyaga county administration plans to reintroduce subsidised artificial insemination services for farmers to improve milk production. Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri said the government has set aside money to initiate AI services aimed at improving animal breeds in the entire county. The county has more than 5,000 registered dairy farmers who will directly benefit from the AI programme. When fully implemented, the project is expected to boost the milk production from the current 8,000 litres to over 12,000 litres daily. The sector is also envisaged to provide job opportunities for many of the unemployed youths in the county. Under the programme, Ndambiri said, youths with interest in dairy production will also be assisted in getting started. “The programme aims at increasing agricultural production and profitability of targeted rural communities for increased incomes to the households and the county,” he said The deputy governor said plans are at an advanced stage to open up a milk factory which will take care of the milk produced by farmers in the county. He said collection and processing of the milk will be coordinated by Kirinyaga Investment Development Authority thus guaranteeing an income for the farmer. Apart from being a guaranteed source of income to group members, the dairy project will create employment to the youth. They will be engaged in the milk collection and transportation from the villages to the collection centre and to the markets, Ndambiri said. He said the county will reduce the cost of production by manufacturing quality and affordable animal’s feeds at the county’s Kiaga Animal Feeds Factory. The deputy governor spoke on Thursday in his rural home in a meeting with the elders of Kiama Kiama who had paid him a visit.
