Two Kakamega leaders engaged in a war of words on Jamhuri Day over the governor’s position in 2022. Kakamega Deputy Governor Philip Kutima and Lugari MP Ayub Savula taunted each other in the presence of Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, when they shared a platform at Bukhungu Stadium on Thursday. Oparanya gave the issue a wide berth during his speech and instead focused on the development track record of his administration in the last seven years. Savula started the exchange when he said he was best-suited to be the next governor of Kakamega and asked Oparanya to give him full support. The MP said he stood a better chance of taking the county to the next level because of his development record. “I’m best placed to succeed Governor Oparanya and those who are running around campaigning to be elected to the position should be prepared for a major battle ahead,” Savula said. The remarks appeared to have rattled Kutima, who said Savula had been “hopping from one end to the other in a helicopter, campaigning to be elected the next governor”. “Those who have been flying in choppers all over the place campaigning to be the next governor have come to their senses and realised there are no voters in the skies,” Kutima said. “They have now come back and are trying to win support by presenting themselves as the best-suited candidates for the position”. The battle for the next county chief is expected to intensify, with former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, Senator Cleophas Malala, among other candidates showing interest in the seat.
