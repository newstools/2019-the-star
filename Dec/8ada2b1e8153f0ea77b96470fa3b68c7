A saloon car with an unknown number of occupants on Saturday morning plunged into the Indian Ocean on the Mainland side of the Likoni channel. According to the Kenya Ferry Services, a motorist driving a saloon car whose registration number plate has not yet been established drove off to the ramps with high speed to the ocean even after being flagged by our ramp controllers despite efforts to slow him down and stop. "The occupants in the car have not yet been established. KFS responded immediately, together with the Kenya Navy, Kenya Police and other multi- agencies," KFS said in a statement. Recovery operations are currently underway. "Our heart, thoughts, and prayers go to the family and friends of the lost lives. We will keep updated on the progress of the recovery," KFS added. The incident comes barely three months after Mariam Kighenda, 35, and her four-year-old daughter Amanda Mutheu died after their car slid from the rear of MV Harambee just before it docked on the Island side.
