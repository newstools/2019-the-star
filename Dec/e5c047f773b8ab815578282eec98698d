At the heart of democracy are undeniable rights of citizens to express their opinions without fear of discrimination or unfair treatment. Unfortunately, this is not happening in many parts around the world where oppressive political systems continue to limit the enjoyment of universal human rights. Keen observation of endless utterances by the political class points to an underlying interest that the citizens must be cognisant of lest they fall victims on the path of nation-building. At the heart of BBI is the need to unite the nation around national ethos and build an all-inclusive state where regardless of tribe or political affiliations, we all feel represented in governance. At the core of the political class is the desire to keep their political bases, win the next election and not so much how to bring to an end negative ethnicity, corruption and uplift the struggling economy. This is where the intentions and motives of the ruling and opposing political class must be shifted against all odds for BBI to succeed. Rather than seeking to maintain moral and fiduciary responsibility offered to them by the virtue of their elected position, many politicians will debate BBI and its probability to inject new life and energy to help them stay relevant in the political spaces rather than look at the next decade for an ageing population. To some, the report was fictitious and not a ‘tsunami’ as promised. With these frustrations and ‘sense of betrayal’, their roles in educating and informing citizens would be biased and unreliable. We must read the document and stay away from misleading utterances by the political class. Leaders can bring a neutral perspective to help Kenyans make an informed decision on the way forward.
