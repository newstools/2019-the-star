Lugari MP Ayub Savula has asked governors to pay their pending bills instead of attacking the National Treasury yet they receive funds. “You cannot use services and goods and refuse to pay the suppliers yet they spend money,” he said in Kakamega on Saturday. The lawmaker said that Matiang’i’s directive was within the law. He said that it was in order for funding to be withheld for counties that have failed to comply with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive to settle all pending bills by November 30. He said Parliament passed a law that required contractors to be paid for the services and goods they supply to government entities within a specified period and governors are not exception. Speaking at Bukhungu stadium on Thursday, Kakamega Governor and Council of Governors chairman Wycliffe Oparanya defended the counties that have delayed to pay their pending bills. He said some governors who are serving their first term of office thought that some of the pending bills were not genuine. Last Monday, Oparanya said governors were unable to pay pending bills because their disbursements for November had been withheld by Treasury. However, some of the pending bills in some counties date back to 2014. Savula said failure to settle the bills by the governors has frustrated many contractors some who have lost their equipment to auctioneers due to their failure to service bank loans. “I am aware of contractors who have lapsed in depression and died because of harassment by auctioneers even after they sunk their money in county projects,” he said. A number of contractors are now shunning county tenders because of the poor payment regime.
