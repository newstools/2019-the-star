 Technical and vocational training is the ideal way to develop skills required for the job market, the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce has said. KICC president Richard Ngatia on Monday said Technical and Vocational Education and Training provide a unique opportunity to impart the youth with the necessary skills for the job market. Ngati was addressing a forum for African, Caribbean and Pacific Groups of States at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre. He called for structured partnerships and collaboration to prepare young people for the job market. Vocational training was identified as the ideal route for developing the required skills for employment creation. Unemployment has been named as one of the key factors contributing to crime and other social ills especially in the big cities where a majority of young people do not have jobs. Ngatia said the private sector and entrepreneurs were pushing for increased intra-trade to boost economic development and industrialisation which in efforts to create jobs. “The private sector provides an essential framework for the economic development programmes as well as promoting productivity by bringing down barriers to doing business and investing in human resources and economic development. As the private sector, we urge the governments to work more closely with the private sector to alleviate some of the difficulties they face in creating job opportunities,” Ngatia said. “The world is currently in the midst of a technological transformation that will fundamentally change the way we live and work. This means nations and governments must re-evaluate how the digital economic opportunities and manufacturing industry are contributing to economic growth.” Ngati said there was need to improve and support the business environment to attract foreign direct investments and create quality jobs through seamless policies.  edited by peter obuya
