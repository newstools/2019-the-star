DCI will on Wednesday arraign a man in court after he was arrested for impersonation. In a tweet, DCI said Evans Ratemo was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly impersonating a cousin to a Cabinet Secretary. "Ratemo had also defrauded unsuspecting Kenyans some Sh600,000," DCI George Kinoti said. Kinoti said that one of the victims who was coned reported the matter prompting them to move swiftly. "...Ratemo will be arraigned today to face charges of obtaining money by false pretenses," he said. According to the detectives, Ratemo had promised to secure jobs for his victims at the Kenya Prisons Service. In August this year, aÂ  Police Constable based at the Central Police station was arrested for impersonating a DCI detective and demanding a bribe.
