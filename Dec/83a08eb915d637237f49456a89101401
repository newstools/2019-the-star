Mathare United coach Salim Ali has promised to stick to their culture of nurturing young talents rather than signing experienced players in the January transfer window. Ali admitted that a clinical finisher topped his wish-list ahead of the window, set for the whole of next month, but maintained he will still go for young attackers to assist the duo of Clifford Alwanga and Klinsman Omulanga in delivering the goals. The Slum Boys have been relying on the two, alongside former Sony Sugar man Daniel Otieno, who is living up to the billing since breaking to the starting team. However, Ali wants to supplement their efforts by roping in promising attackers in line with their culture. The tactician noted that his side was creating clear-cut chances thanks to their 'short passes philosophy' but converting them remains a big concern. The former player, who rose to the managerial role in August after his then boss, Francis Kimanzi quit, revealed that he had already identified the two players, who are expected to join them next week at their training venue in Pangani. "We create a lot of clear-cut chances but we do not make them count. We need a top striker but our culture dictates that we mould young players and we will stick to that. We have identified two players who are expected to join the team by next week," said Ali. Besides beefing the striking front, Ali also disclosed his plans of revamping defence and midfield to meet their objectives this season. Mathare, whose squad is dominated by young players, have won and drawn five matches respectively in 13 outings to place ninth with 20 points. "We will analyse where we had loopholes in our matches so far as we also seek to strengthen midfield and defence," added Ali.
