Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has alleged that Deputy Governor James Nyoro has been sacking workers inhumanely, leaving their families suffering. The governor promised to reinstate all those who have been sacked, saying some were on contract. He urged residents to pray for a breakthrough in the graft case he is facing. "All I am asking from you is prayers. I want the case to end. I feel bad when I hear people being sacked. Once I come back to the office, I will reinstate all of them," the governor said on Friday. But Nyoro has dismissed the allegations by Waititu, describing them as political talks. Waititu, his wife Susan Wangari and eight county officials are facing corruption charges over the irregular awarding of Sh588 million tenders. Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi ordered Waititu to stay out of the office during the trial period. The governor spoke during the burial of Stanley Mwangi in Gitithia village. Mwangi was a contractor with the county government of Kiambu. He left behind widow Dorcas Wanjiru and four children. Waititu directed the public administration director to employ Mwangi's widow as a cook at the county offices, saying she has young children. Waititu was accompanied by Limuru Central MCA Joseph Kahenya, nominated MCA Susan Njeri, executives Karungo Thangwa (Youth and Sports) and David Kuria (Water). Others were county secretary Martin Njogu, former deputy speaker Antony Macharia, director of public administration Peter Gichuki. Kahenya urged residents to pray for Waititu to be allowed to return to the office and accomplish the promise he made during the campaigns. Karungo alleged that MCA's attempted to impeach him because he declined to swear loyalty to Nyoro, adding that he would never stop supporting Waititu. He claimed taht whenever one speaks against Nyoro, they are given 30 days suspension letter, saying it was intimidation.
