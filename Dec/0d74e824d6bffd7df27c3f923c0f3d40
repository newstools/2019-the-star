 The marking of this year's KCSE Business Studies Paper 2  continues at the Machakos Girls High School centre after a two-day standoff over pay ended on Tuesday morning. The Kenya National Examinations Council agreed to pay the over 1,000 markers  Sh57 per script instead of Sh45. Knec had on Monday evening ordered the examiners to leave the centre after they refused to take the Sh45 "peanuts". They accused Knec of backtracking on a Sh68 per script pay deal. They refused to take the Sh45, hence the standoff that lasted from Sunday when they arrived at the marking centre to Monday evening. Knec told the examiners to leave the centre latest on Tuesday morning. However, the two sides concluded a deal before the examiners left. One of the examiners had on Monday confided in the Star that Knec had agreed to raise the marking fee to Sh68 per script. “Knec had promised to adjust the marking rates upwards as we have been negotiating with them for the past two years. However, we were shocked to find they were offering Sh45 per paper which was way below our expectations,” the examiners who chose not to be named said. He said the national examiner had agreed to increase the marking rate by at least Sh10 only to renege on Monday morning when the marking was about to start. The stand-off prompted Knec chief executive officer Mercy Karogo to rush to the centre to calm the situation. The marking is expected to be concluded in the next 15 days.
