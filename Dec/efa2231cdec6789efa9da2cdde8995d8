Ulinzi Warriors tactician William Balozi says he wants to wrap up the semi-final series against champions Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) this weekend. The two giants meet in a pivotal Game Three at the Nyayo Stadium gymnasium at 6pm today. The best of five-game series is tied 1-1 after they shared the spoils in Mombasa last weekend. The Porters got the series off to a slippery start, going down 86-69 in Game One played at their own back yard but fired back to take Game Two with an emphatic 96-69 scoreline. Going by these two results, this is a watertight encounter that can go either way. The soldiers are the top seed with KPA making the playoffs in the fourth place. "We had problems playing zone defence in that loss. We have worked on this and are good to go come tomorrow (today). I need the two wins but I know it will not be easy," said Balozi. KPA's Sammy Kiki is also coming to Nairobi to kill off the series and progress to the finals. He says he wants to avoid Game Five and will, therefore, approach every game seriously. Thunder take on surprise package Emyba, the lowest-seeded team to make the last four. Their semifinal is also tied at 1-1. National team captain Griffin Ligare has not shown class in the two matches where Emyba, led by Fred Odongo and Eugene Adera, have proved more than capable of pulling off another surprise.
