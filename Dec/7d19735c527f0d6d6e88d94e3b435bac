Jamhuri Day is marked in Kenya to mark a major events in our historical calendar- when Kenya became a republic. This Jamhuri Day finds Kenya in a mess as top leaders don't seem to be reading from the same script on an initiative meant to bridge the divide caused by years of political tension. The governor of the country's capital is in court for the serious charge of graft among other equally heavy ones such as escape from lawful detention from a maximum security prison. Inasmuch as we have something to celebrate–being free from colonialists and being a republic–we have not achieved much in terms of leadership and ruling ourselves. This holiday will make more sense as a day off work for people working in public offices.  Mombasa
