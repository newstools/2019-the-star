South Africa music icon Yvonne Chaka Chaka has reacted to news that she has been deported from Uganda. In a Twitter post, the musician said she had take a decision not to perform on New Year's Eve because there were things not explained to her. "I am fine. Not deported... not arrested... not captured... everything is fine... everything is in order," Yvonne tweeted. She added; "I took a decision not to appear this evening at Enkuka because there were too many things that I did not understand or explain. If someone would have explained to me I would have understood." Earlier, Ugandan authorities issued a statement saying that they had deported her as she did not have a work visa. Police spokesperson, Fred Enanga said that immigration officials cancelled her ordinary visa when they realised that she was in the country to perform at New Year events. "This is to inform the public that a security task team, in close coordination with immigration officials, this afternoon escorted Ms Mhinga Yvonne, popularly known as Chaka Chaka, to Entebbe International Airport, where she boarded her next immediate flight to South Africa, via Kigali," he said. The musician was set to perform at the Enkuka concert organised by the king of Buganda kingdom. Yvonne has previously declared support for musician turned politician Bobi Wine who has been a strong critic of Uganda President Yoweri Museveni. She once described Wine was "the next Nelson Mandela", a statement that was not taken lightly by Museveni's loyalists. Wine went on Twitter dismissing the Uganda government when news of her deportation broke. "Our friends from abroad have attracted the wrath of the state for openly supporting our struggle for freedom," he said. He added; "Today international icon @YvonneChakaX2 was deported from Uganda. Whatever reasons the security agencies give, we all know the regime is afraid of her SONGS OF FREEDOM!"
