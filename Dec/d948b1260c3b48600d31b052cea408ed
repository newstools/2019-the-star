As a way of ensuring that marathoners and road runners do not miss doping tests, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) has established an application to guide them in updating their whereabouts. While addressing athletes in Eldoret, AIU head of education and communication Aditya Kumar said the application was introduced in a bid to improve integrity and performance for the runners. “The application will guide the road runners in training as we seek to defend clean athletes from cheats,” said Kumar. He added that they have to put road runners, most of whom are Kenyans,  under high scrutiny. Kenya was chosen as the first destination for road running conference, thanks to the number of successful long-distance athletes the country has produced. “Doping in Kenya is very complex and you just have a handful of talent around. We want to protect good sports in the world,” said Kumar. He added: “We looked at the road runners in the world and 320 athletes in the world were Kenyans which translates to 45% globally,” Kumar in the meantime emphasized on the significance of honesty as well as shunning doping which he observed had led many to early retirement. He singled out Jemima Sumgong's case, saying the former Olympics winner had presented fake information that culminated in an eight-year ban. “Give qualified and verified the information. Don’t agree to be used by fake doctors because before we suspend or ban you, we also do thorough investigations. Should we find out that you had presented fake information, then a lengthy ban will be recommended,” advised Kumar.
