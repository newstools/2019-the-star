A Kiambu court yesterday ordered Nairobi MCA Redson Onyango to produce a suspect in Sh135 million bank fraud or forfeit his Sh5 million surety. The suspect, Geoffrey Ojow, was charged with electronic fraud from the National Bank of Kenya and has jumped bail in the case. Senior principal magistrate Stellah Atambo gave Onyango until Friday to produce the accused or to surrender his Sh5 million. Ojow is charged alongside Grace Kamau, Abdikarim Abdi, Ahmed Hassan, John Munala Seka, John Kamara, Paul Ng'ang'a, PatrickÂ  Shakaba, Brayan Onjula and Titus Muthama. They have all pleaded not guilty. They are charged with conspiring to steal over Sh135.4 million from the National Bank of Kenya. They are among 131 other suspects whom DCI George Kinoti has been pursuing in connection with electronic fraud. The suspects were earlier brought to court separately after presenting themselves to DCI offices on learning they were being sought by detectives. They are also facing others charges of stealing Sh2 million from National Bank, handling the same stolen money and conspiracy to steal Sh135,402,700 between December 18 and 20 last year. They are further accused of electronic fraud through altering 49 clients' accounts that led the bank to lose Sh6,982,623. DCI Kinoti has so far obtained arrest warrants issued by Kiambu courts for 79 suspects, while the remaining 52 were issued by Nairobi's Milimani courts. This followed an application by the prosecution that the suspects are still at large. DCI has also requested members of the public who may have any information about their whereabouts to report to their nearest offices.
