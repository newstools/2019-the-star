A postmortem on William Makali, the son of former Vice President Michael Wamalwa, will be done on Tuesday, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa has said. The CS, who was Makali's uncle, said he died on Sunday evening after being rushed to the hospital for medication. Wamalwa said the family is shocked by the sudden death. "We are very saddened with the loss of our son," Wamalwa said. The CS said Makali was fine on Saturday and went out with his friends, but on Sunday, he was found unconscious in his house. Wamalwa said, "As a family, we thank doctors who tried to save his life, but unfortunately he died." Wamalwa said the burial arrangements have started and Makali will be buried next Saturday. He said the burial committee will be led by Robert Wamalwa, Makali's uncle. The CS said the family will give a report on the cause of his death after the release of the postmortem. He urged members of the public to ignore social media propaganda circulating. Earlier in the day, Robert said Makali had diabetes and the family was not sure of that is what killed him. Makali was a second year student at the University of Nairobi. He was the third born son of the late vice president.
