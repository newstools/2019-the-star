Tennis Kenya (TK) president James Kenani and secretary-general Wanjiru Mbugua Karani have been invited to serve on ITF committees. Kenani will serve on the Wheelchair Tennis Committee while Mbugua will offer her services on the Gender Equality Committee. The two were among those named as the  ITF unveiled the composition of their various committees for the 2020-21 calendar. The committees, commissions and task forces assist the ITF and its Board of Directors across key areas of the sport. Committee members include representatives of the ITF Board, member nations and other individuals with specific areas of expertise. A statement from the ITF read: "In line with the ITF 2024 strategy, the 2020-21 appointments reflect the ITF’s drive for gender equality, inclusion and cooperation. ITF President David Haggerty said: “Tennis can be proud of its  achievements in providing equal opportunities on court, but we recognise that this is not yet reflected in leadership roles at the highest levels.  We encourage our national and regional associations to continue to diversify  their boards and committees to grant talented leaders the opportunity to develop and assume senior positions in our sport.” Elsewhere, Mercy Oresehe came from a set down to beat Maggie Flava Namaganda of Uganda 4-6, 6-2, 10-8 in the ITF-CAT 14 and under tournament at the Nairobi Club. Oreshe was outclassed in the first half but showed nerves of steel in the second and third sets to progress to the third round.
