Murdered Siaya-based Star journalist was buried on Saturday (Pg29). One week after the killing, the woman in whose house she was murdered, Chief Inspector of Police Nancy Kerubo, is scot-free. Granted, two suspects linked to the murder have been arrested and police granted more time to hold them for further investigations. However, our investigations and inquiries have established that top cops in Siaya and some at police headquarters are determined to shield Kerubo from prosecution. Instead, they want to turn her into a prosecution witness or, even worse, meddle with the investigation so it collapses. Indications of this include booking Oloo under the wrong name at the mortuary on the night he was killed and frustrating the family's bid for an independent post-mortem. The role of the police is to investigate and report findings to the DPP to determine the merits and demerits of the case. We have no faith in investigations conducted so far by Siaya police and demand the DCI boss George Kinoti constitutes an independent probe. DPP Nordin Haji should also ask for a preliminary report of the investigation so far to establish if there are cover-up attempts. Justice delayed is justice denied. Those with Oloo's blood on their hands must be brought to book.  Charles Dickens The British author gave his first public reading in the US in a New York City theatre on December 2, 1867
