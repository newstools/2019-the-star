President Uhuru Kenyatta has called on Kenyans to live together in peace and harmony in order to develop a prosperous nation. The President spoke at St Francis of Assisi Catholic Church in Nyali, Mombasa County where he attended a Christmas eve mass. He was accompanied by First Lady Margaret Kenyatta and other members of the first family. The President and his family are currently on holiday in the Coastal town of Mombasa. In his address to the congregation, Uhuru wished Kenyans a Merry Christmas and a prosperous New Year. He thanked the Church for their prominent role in the push for national unity and in the fight against corruption. Deputy President William Ruto also sent a message of goodwill to Kenyans from he and his family. "This is the season to spend time with loved ones and reconnect with the beauty of our country as we travel back and forth across the country," Ruto posted on his Twitter handle. The DP and his family are on holiday in Southern Africa and are expected to explore the Kalahari desert region. He urged Kenyans to remember those who do not have as much they do and to drive safely and obey traffic rules. "We should be law abiding citizens. We need to reflect on the year that was and plan for a bigger and better 2020. And pray for God's blessings upon our country and our families now and in the days ahead," Ruto said.
