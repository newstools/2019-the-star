The Public Service Commission has shortlisted eight out of the 14 shortlisted candidates for the post of the University of Nairobi Vice-Chancellor. The candidates include the acting Vice-Chancellor Isaac Meroka Mbeche, Stephen Kiama, Bernard Njoroge, Madara Ogot, Patricia Kameri, Kareithi Ruth, Solomon Shibairo and Elija Omwenga. “Shortlisted candidates are invited for interviews at the CEO’s boardroom, commission house, along Harambee Avenue, on Wednesday 18 December 2019,” the PSC said in a notice. The former UoN VC Peter Mbithi was not among the 14 applicants for the top seat. This comes after the University Council rejected the former vice-chancellor Peter Mbithi's bid for a direct appointment for a second term. The council, chaired by Julia Ojiambo, urged Mbithi to go on leave effective July 6 as the recruitment process gets started. “Members of the public are invited to avail in writing any credible information of interest on any of the shortlisted candidates,” PSC said. The candidates are supposed to carry their national identity card or passport, academic and professional certificates and any other supporting documents for the interviews. “They are also expected to have clearance certificates from the Kenya Revenue authority, EACC, HELB, DCI, and a registered Credit Reference Bureau," PSC said. Those who applied but were not shortlisted for interviews are Omondi Orata, Maurice Amutabi, Isiah Ndiege, Shitanda Douglas, Collins Ogutu and Julius Odhuodho.
