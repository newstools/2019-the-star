Kenya bowed out of the Cape Town sevens with a 17-5 defeat to South Africa in the quarterfinal on Sunday. Shujaa started brightly and were rewarded when Alvin “ Buffa” Otieno touched down at the corner for an unconverted try and a 5-0 lead. The hosts pinned Kenya in their own half and levelled matters courtesy of Ruhan Nel with the conversion missed to tie the scores at 5-5 at the interval On resumption, the hosts came out firing on all cylinders and Nel scored his second try with Justin Geduld kicking over the conversion for a 12-5 lead. Shujaa tried to rally but ball handling errors and granite defence by the hosts kept them at bay. Substitute Selvyn Davids then put the icing on the cake with a well taken try at the death to send the Blitzbokke to the semifinals.
