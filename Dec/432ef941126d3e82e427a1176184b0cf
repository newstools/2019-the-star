Strathmore Leos have appointed Louis Kisia as the new head coach. Kisia takes over from John Mbai who was relieved of his duties earlier this season. Kisia's target will be to see the varsity side get promoted to the Kenya Cup after relegation last season. "Ultimately, my target is to ensure we get promoted to Kenya Cup next season and finish in the mid-table positions,” added Kisia. Leos currently lead the championship standings with 29 points—four ahead of Masinde Muliro University with Northern Suburbs third on 18 points. Kisia first match in charge will be against Masinde Muliro in Kakamega on Saturday. "It will be a tough game. Masinde Muliro are a quality side and it is an away game for us and we must be ready” added Kisia. Kisia termed the league very competitive with the likes of Mean Machine and South Coast Pirates contenders for the two promotion slots. “It's wide open we have strong sides and we must be consistent," he added.  Kisia had a 15-year stint with Mwamba— 14 of them as a player and one as  a coach Kisia noted that recruitment will be key if they are to rub shoulders with the big sides come next season. “The University is in a good position and can offer scholarships to highly talented athletes. We need to cash in on that and get the right players going forward,” he noted. Elsewhere, Kenya Cup have announced a change in kick-off times for the weekend fixtures.
