A man was yesterday charged in a Kibera court with illegal possession of a firearm. Dismas Adega denied the charge before senior principal magistrate Boaz Ombewa. Court documents say that Adega was found in possession of a firearm without certification on December 8 in Lang’ata shopping centre within Nairobi county. A police statement said members of the public reported Adega after he entered a garage in Lang’ata with a motor vehicle looking suspicious and armed with a gun. The officers who were on patrol then proceeded to the area spotted the car which had two occupants. They inspected and found Adega with a gun. He also looked very drunk. The officers arrested him. Yesterday, Adega told the court that he never committed the offence. He said that he was the breadwinner of his family. He said that he was not in a position to pay unrealistic bond terms and requested the court to release him on lenient bond terms. Adega said that he will abide by all court sessions if released on bond. Ombewa released him on a bond of Sh500,000 with a surety of the same amount. The case will be mentioned on  January 16 and be heard on March 3.
