Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has vowed to stand with 'my friend' - Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko - as he prepares to face graft charges. "You don’t run away from friends," he said. Sonko was nabbed by DCI detectives in Voi on Friday, a few hours after the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji ordered for his arrest. Haji said Sonko and several other City Hall officials will be charged with facilitating and, or benefitting from irregular procurement and payments amounting to Sh357 million. Murkomen, who is also the Majority Leader of the Senate, said Sonko has a constitutional right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. "I also know many governors; Mombasa, Machakos, Siaya etc who are protected becuse they are politically correct". Sonko, who has been ferried to the Integrity Center for questioning, has since released a statement urging his supporters to remain calm. "I want to confidently state from the onset that I am more than ready for the lawful course that will help us know the truth," he said. "I assure everyone that I shall not be intimidated and won’t be moved an inch into some political traps". Sonko said he stands for justice and he is  more than ready for the court process County assembly speaker Beatrice Elachi is likely to take over as governor at City Hall following Sonko's arrest since he does not have a deputy. This move could also trigger a by-election in Nairobi as the speaker can only act for a period of 60 days.
