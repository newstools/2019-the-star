Retired President Daniel Arap Moi is still admitted at the Nairobi Hospital 20 days after he was re-admitted. Moi was re-admitted at the facility only two days after he was discharged. Press Secretary Lee Njiru then said the former President was undergoing a routine medical check-up. Since then Moi has been at the hospital's  VIP wing, a homely setup, to facilitate continual checkups and necessary treatment. On Monday Njiru in a phone interview, told the Star that Moi has been under the watch of a team of medics led by his physician Dr David Silverstein. He said for now Moi has recovered but the doctors feel he should build up his energy before he can be discharged. He said his discharge will, however, depend on the doctors' advice. "Mzee is still in the hospital but fairing on well. We shall issue a statement on his condition on Wednesday. For now, we only follow the advice of the doctors," he said. Njiru said the statement will, however, be issued only if necessary. "There is nothing dramatic about Mzee's health. We know he is an international figure loved by many people and they must be concerned about his well being. I can confirm that there is nothing to worry about," he said. Njiru, however, said numerous rumours circulating on social media that mzee is dead is causing more harm to the family. "Let the media try to be cautious with mzee's matters. If you reported today that he is dead, and then tomorrow you say he is not, this will put your credibility in question. Let us avoid this embarrassment. There are channels of communication and if anyone needs any information let them ask," he said. This is now the fourth time Moi has been admitted to the hospital in less than two months. Njiru earlier on said the former head of state has recurring chest complications that affect his breathing. In March last year, Moi was flown to Israel following “an uncomfortable knee.” In 2017, Moi underwent minor surgery on the knee at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi.
