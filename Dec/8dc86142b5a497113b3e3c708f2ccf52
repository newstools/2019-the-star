A commissioner of Police has lauded Meru matatu operators especially Raha Sacco, Express Sacco, Unique Shuttle and Meru Nissan Sacco for obeying traffic rules and discipline. “The other Kenyan PSVS should emulate Meru Matatu Saccos who have the most disciplined drivers. We have observed vehicles with worn out tires, defective brakes, reckless drivers, speeding and non-roadworthy vehicles as the main cause of accidents,” George Losku Ali said. He urged drivers and vehicle owners to comply with the NTSA rules to avoid being impounded during the ongoing inspection. “Police are your brothers. We are human too. When asked to stop for inspection please do so. Running out of a moving vehicle is risking other people lives. We have arrested five drivers and impounded their vehicles after they jumped out of moving vehicles,” he said. Ali castigated vehicle owners who allow drivers to drive unroadworthy vehicles. “Owners of vehicles, don’t force your driver to work with an unroadworthy vehicle since these are the vehicles causing accidents. Make sure your vehicle is inspected first,” Ali said. Ali urged passengers to fasten their seat belts whenever travelling and not when they see a police officer in front of their matatu. “Those safety belts are not there for us to inspect. We are only enforcers and people should ensure they buckle up before the vehicle takes off, not when they see a police officer,” Ali said.
