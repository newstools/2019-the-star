New Coast region Chapa Dimba na Safaricom champions Yanga FC have set their sights on national glory following their successful exploits at the regional level. Yanga FC drubbed Kaloleni's Kaya Stars 4-0 in the final on Sunday to progress to the nationals. Coach Abel Bellamy said the tactical changes were central to their achievement and will embark on thorough preparations for the national showpiece set for Bomu Stadium, Mombasa in June next year. “We narrowly escaped defeat in the semi-finals and had to reconsider our approach in the final. "We made a couple of tactical changes and gave our attackers more freedom to trouble the opposition backline. "Defensively, we were watertight and the result is a testament of how good we are. We are happy for this victory and look forward to playing in the national finals. It won't be easy but with proper preparations, we can do well. ” said Bellamy. In the girls' final, Kwale Ladies beat Malindi Action 3-0  to book a national ticket and coach George Ojwaya was equally optimistic of a strong show at the nationals “We were absolutely ready for the final and we have achieved our target. We shall go back to the drawing board and prepare adequately to ensure we put up a strong show in the national finals. There's more work to be done defensively,”  Ojwaya said. Both Yanga FC and Kwale Ladies won Sh200,000 and have joined Berlin FC from Garissa on the road to the national finals where Sh1 million will be at stake. The competition now moves to Nanyuki for the Central regional finals set for January 18th and 19 at the Nanyuki Stadium.
