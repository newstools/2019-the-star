Shambani and Aremiet residents in Burat have been marooned after Isiolo and Ewaso Nyiro rivers burst their banks leading to flooding. They have appealed for help from the county and national governments. Joseph Eskuku, a youth leader in Isiolo, said residents are staring at disease outbreaks and starvation in the face. He called upon the government and other humanitarian organisations such as the Red Cross to airlift food and non-food items to forestall loss of lives. The inaccessibility problem is devastating. Not even security officers can respond to their emergencies. Francis Nakatien, a teacher at Shambani Primary School, said the sick are the worst-hit as they cannot reach health centres â€” all of which are on the other side of the Isiolo River. Children cannot play away from their homes. Even young people can no longer be sent to the market. They will have to wait for the water to subside if they have to help with such errands. The flood also swept away Shambani bridge that links the area to Alamach, Attan, Lotiki, Mlango, Kipsing and Oldonyiro areas. Pastor Samuel Lokoro, a resident of Aremiet, said the bridge was dilapidated and had been a campaign tool for every politician asking for votes. Over the years, politicians have been promising to build a better one once they are elected but that has been the furthest they go with their promises, he said. "The county leadership should make haste and provide even a footbridge to ease pressure on residents who have been marooned and isolated," the cleric said. Last week, raging floodwaters also found their way into Ashnil Camp, a tourist destination within Buffalo Springs game reserve, prompting an overnight rescue operation. Visitors were evacuated using helicopters. (Edited by F'Orieny)
