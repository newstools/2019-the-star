A woman was arrested in Ndhiwa town yesterday morning for allegedly defiling a Form 3 boy. Residents said the woman, 25, lured the boy with money in exchange for sex. The woman who works as a cashier in a bar is said to have been defiling the student in her house since schools were closed in October. On Saturday, the boy’s father discovered that his son, 17, had disappeared to an unknown place for four days. A private tutor hired to coach the boy and his sister at home complained that he could hardly be seen. “I hired a teacher who was coaching the boy and his sister during the holiday tuition. The teacher has been complaining that the boy was not consistent in attending the lessons,” his father said. The father said he went to the woman’s house with the police yesterday and found her sleeping with the boy. She was arrested and detained at Ndhiwa police Station. Residents led by Bernard Ogallo expressed their displeasure with the woman’s conduct. “The incident is unfortunate because the woman is ruining the life of a boy who is expected to contribute significantly to the economy of this country in future. She deserves a legal action,” Ogallo said. Ndhiwa police boss Evans Ombui said their investigations revealed that the woman defiled the boy.  He said they will arraign her today (Monday). “Defilement is a criminal offence. We are going to charge her,” Ombui said.
