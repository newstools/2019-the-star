Most Kenyans are yet to read the BBI report as they have not accessed it, North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood has said Dawood said there are challenges in getting the report as not everyone has access to the internet. “I request President Uhuru Kenyatta to organise with the Interior ministry to see how people in the rural areas can get the report, not only in English but also in Kiswahili,” he said. He warned that politicians should not be let to explain to Kenyans the contents of the report as they may twerk it to fit their political aspirations. He said the national government administration officers should be used to ensure each Kenyan has a copy and has read it. He spoke to the Star at Kambakia on Monday. He said some sections of the BBI report should go through Parliament and others through a referendum. “There are clauses that have to go through a referendum. For instance, a health commission must go through a referendum because health is a devolved function,” Dawood said. Dawood said the report indicates on page 98 that some amendments will be administrative, while others will go through Parliament. “Let us wait for President Uhuru to give us a go ahead and call for the conference he will call in January and give us the way forward,” Dawood said. He said the country has about 18 months to sort out the BBI report. “If there is a referendum, so be it but let us not spend too much money on the referendum. If it can be held together with the general election, then we can save a lot of money,” he said.
