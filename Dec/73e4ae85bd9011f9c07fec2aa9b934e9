A public health officer in Kilifi County was on Tuesday forced to leave a public forum and look for condoms to distribute to scores of women displaced by floods in Magarini, Kilifi County. This was after the over 2,000 women in Garashi location, complained that they were likely to suffer sexual urges from men 'salivating' for them as they were staying in congested tents away from their spouses. â€œSince we have been staying here for more than two weeks without our husbands who are at the farms taking care of our assets and distant towns working, we have normal women desires and can easily be convinced by men in this place to make love," one of them said. Public Health Officer Amos Nthenge had toured the area to assess the situation but the women said they would only listen to him if he attended to their plea.
