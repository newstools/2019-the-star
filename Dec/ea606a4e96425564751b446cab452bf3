The government will readvertise the position of Auditor General after the PSC selection panel failed to get suitable candidates from the 17 shortlisted. Nine employees at the Auditor General’s office had been shortlisted for the job. They are deputy auditors-general David Gichana, Alex Rugera, Silvester Kiini, William Agunda, Edwin Kamar and directors Elizabeth Nguringa, Meshack Onyango, Nancy Gathungu, and Dennis Theuri. Other shortlisted candidates were Abdullahi Idris, David Muchoki, Kitonyo Peter, Leonard Rang’ala, Francis Kigo, Moses Edwin, Tulula Joseph, and Calistus Wekesa. The fresh advertisement for applicants will appear on Friday's dailies. PSC chairman Stephen Kirago on Wednesday said the decision was reached after consultation with the office of the President. Former Auditor General Edward Ouko completed his non-renewable eight- year term in August. The Public Service Commission selection panel that steered the recruitment had presented its results on the week ending November 22. The Public Audit Act, 2015, stipulates that the President should choose a nominee within seven days of presentation of the list of three candidates. From November 22 – the date the panel presented its report – the President was expected to forward the name to the National Assembly by December 3. MPs went into recess on December 5 and are not expected back until February 11, 2020, unless summoned by Speaker Justin Muturi for a special sitting. The Auditor-General audits national and county governments. Many a time he piles pressure on the government to spend public cash prudently and exposes financial indiscipline that can embarrass a government.
