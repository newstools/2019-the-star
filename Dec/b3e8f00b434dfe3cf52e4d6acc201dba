The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is an annual international campaign that kicks off on November 25–the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women–and runs until December 10–Human Rights Day. In Kenya, sexual and gender-based violence takes different forms. These include forced abortions, rape, cyberbullying, spousal killings and forced sterilisation of persons with disabilities among others. In 2017, the International Planned Parenthood Federation Africa region offered over 1.3 million services relating to sexual and gender-based violence. In Kenya, 14 per cent of women and six per cent of men aged 15-49 have experienced sexual violence at least once in their lifetime. This includes adolescent girls who are just transitioning to early adulthood. Sexual violence comes with many repercussions on reproductive health. This includes loss of self-esteem and reduced productivity, infection with Sexually Transmitted Infections as well as unintended pregnancies. The trauma resulting from sexual violence that has been perpetrated by relatives, especially parents, creates an emotional impact for a long time. Children, especially adolescent girls, who were raped by their fathers or close relatives, take time to emotionally heal. In school, these children prefer being isolated and their concentration is also affected. Several gaps exist in addressing sexual and gender violence among young girls and women in Kenya. These include delayed prosecution of court cases, inadequate trained counsellors and health workers and failure by victims to open up if the sexual violence involved relatives. Bail for perpetrators also puts victims through trauma.  Naya Kenya, Nairobi
