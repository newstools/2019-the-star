We should praise the skies for giving us an abundance of water in the form of rain. Unfortunately, it has led to flooding in some areas where scores of people and livestock have died as a result. The weatherman has said the rains will continue to the year-end. The skies could become dry soon thereafter and we could soon face dry spells. Letâ€™s harvest the rainwater while we can to avert a possible drought crisis next year. Inasmuch as the rains have wreaked havoc in some parts of the country, we should focus on the bright side and store as much water as we can. The response of the state to the situation could also save thousands living in flood-prone areas instead of merely telling them to move to higher ground. It should also provide aid to affected families.  Mombasa
