The World Health Organization defines child sexual abuse as the involvement of a child in sexual activity that he or she does not fully comprehend, is unable to give informed consent to, or for which the child is not developmentally prepared for, or that violates the laws or social taboos of society. Culture, peer influence, poverty and the influence of social media makes children vulnerable to unprotected sex and sexual abuse. Child sexual abuse comes with many consequences including loss of self-esteem that may affect productivity in learning. In some communities, marrying an underaged person is not seen as a violation in any way. Here, the bride price is placed the moment a girl child is born. The Kenya Violence Against Children study indicates that during childhood, 32 per cent of females and 18 per cent of males experience sexual violence out of which 66 per cent of females and 73 per cent of males experienced physical violence and 26 per cent of females and 32 per cent of males experience any violence as a child. The Constitution of Kenya and the Children’s Act gives children the right to healthcare, shelter, education and protection against sexual abuse.  Creating awareness of the rights of children at the community level will empower communities to report acts of sexual violence against children. In addition, adequate implementation of comprehensive sexuality education in Kenyan schools will provide learners with the confidence to speak out on issues of unwelcomed sexual advances. Political will is also required to implement policies relating to protecting children against sexual abuse. We cannot settle such abuses out of court, for the sake of our children’s safety.
