The two Cuban doctors kidnapped in April and taken to Somalia "are well," news site Radio France International (RFI) has reported. According to the site, Ines Maria Chapman, vice president of the Cuban Council of Ministers, said, "The Kenyan authorities affirmed that both doctors, Assel Herrera and Landy Rodriguez, are well and they will continue their efforts, as well as those carried out by our country, for their safe return to Cuba." The Cuban official spoke on Tuesday. She did not give details on the whereabouts of the doctors. In September, Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai said police were still searching for the two doctors. They were abducted on April 12 by suspected al Shabaab militants in Mandera. Herrera Correa and Landhi Rodriguez who were working at Mandera County Referral Hospital were kidnapped by gunmen suspected to be al Shabaab militants as they headed to work from their residence. One of their bodyguards was shot dead on the spot before the doctors were bundled into two waiting cars that sped off towards the Somali border. Mutyambai said the government was making every effort to safely rescue the two doctors from the hands of their captors. He said suspected abductors of the Cuban doctors had been arrested and charged.
