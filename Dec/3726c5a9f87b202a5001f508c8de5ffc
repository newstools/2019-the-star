Dubai-based hotel management firm Aleph Hospitality has opened the Best Western Plus in Westlands. This marks the company’s continued expansion in Kenya, bringing the total number of facilities under development to four including the Protea Hotel by Marriott in Kisumu, an airport hotel in Nairobi and Best Western Plus Creekside Hotel in Mombasa. “We are proud to be part of Kenya’s growth and to support the economy with more than 80 new jobs and the generation of additional international visitors that Best Western Plus Westlands will bring,” Aleph Hospitality Bani Haddad said. The new, purpose-built hotel features 101 stylish, air-conditioned guest rooms, including spacious Junior Suites with separate living rooms and kitchenettes and a luxurious Penthouse Suite with a private outdoor hot tub. “We are thrilled to find a partner in Aleph Hospitality that supports both our vision for Nairobi’s hospitality sector and our country’s wider efforts to market Kenya as a destination of choice,” the hotel’s owner Amit Lukka said. Aleph Hospitality, which has earmarked a pipeline of 35 hotels in the Middle East and Africa by 2025, manages hotels directly for owners, either on a franchise basis for branded properties or as a white label operator for independently branded hotels. The company operates four hotels in Africa, with six new openings already slated for 2020.
