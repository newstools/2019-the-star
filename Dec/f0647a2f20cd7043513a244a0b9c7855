The Nairobi County Assembly will wait for an advisory opinion from the Attorney General over the crisis at City Hall following the barring of Governor Mike Sonko from office. County Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi on Wednesday adjourned sittings. In her communication to the house, Elachi said the assembly will act upon receiving the opinion from the AG and relevant agencies. “This situation is unique hence it is important that we wait for the way forward, but the assembly will proceed for recess as we wait for a special sitting pursuant to provisions of Standing Order No. 30 should the need arise,” she said. According to the assembly calender, the MCAs will resume sittings next year in February. Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja on Wednesday asked for the Senate to hold a special sitting to discuss the crisis at City Hall. He said the special sitting will allow the Senate to give direction, including resolving to take legal or legislative action in the interest of the people of Nairobi. Sakaja in a letter to Speaker Kenneth Lusaka said Sonko being barred from office prevents him from delivering his mandate. "Seeing that Nairobi does not have a Deputy Governor as is the case of Kiambu County where a similar direction has been given, serious concerns and questions have arisen as to how the county will be run in the interim period," Sakaja's letter read in part. Sakaja said Standing order 30(1) of the Senate provides that whenever during a Session the Senate stands adjourned, whether or not a day has been appointed for the next meeting, the Speaker may, on the request of the Senate Majority Leader or the Senate Minority Leader, and in each case with the support of at least 15 senators, appoint a day for a special sitting of the Senate.
