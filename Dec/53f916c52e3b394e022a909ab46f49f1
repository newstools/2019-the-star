First-term US Senator Kamala Harris of California, a rising Democratic Party star and outspoken critic of Republican President Donald Trump's immigration policies, will end her bid in the 2020 presidential race, according to media reports on Tuesday. Harris, 55, positioned herself as a unifying candidate who could energize the party’s base of young, diverse progressives while also appealing to more moderate voters. Yet after climbing into double digits in opinion polls following a strong debate performance in June, Harris slid out of the top tier in recent months and lags behind leading candidates’ fundraising hauls. The senator from California’s departure from the race is the first of a top-tier candidate from the crowded nominating contest. Harris entered the race as an immediate front-runner but then struggled to maintain support, which critics said was fueled by her inability to articulate policy positions and the backlash of an attempt to attack rival former Vice President Joe Biden.
