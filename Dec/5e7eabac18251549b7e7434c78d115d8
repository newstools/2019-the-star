Rumukia Coffee Society farmers in Mukurweini subcounty, Nyeri county, have appealed to the government to waive a Sh100 million loan to save it from total collapse. The once giant coffee society is now reeling in debts acquired from financial institutions that have crippled the farmers to the extent of some abandoning the crop. Led by society chairman Paul Kariuki, the farmers attributed the woes to political interference and leadership wrangles that have persisted for years. “We are requesting our government to intervene and assist our farmers, especially in waiving these debts so that we can go back to our former years, when farmers enjoyed good payments,” Kariuki said. He  spoke on Friday at Thunguri Coffee Factory during a meeting with the society’s management. He lamented that when coffee payments were made, the bank deducted their dues, leaving the farmers with very little money, thus  affecting production. “We are looking up to the government to see what it can do to save the situation,” the chairman added. Kariuki, however, persuaded farmers to go back to their farms and increase production noting that the future of the crop is promising. He rubbished allegations by previous management that his team was misappropriating farmers’ finances, saying audits done on the society by teams from the county and national governments had given them a clean bill of health.
