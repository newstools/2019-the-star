Kwale county commissioner Karuku Ngumo has sent a strong ultimatum to a group known as “Taireni” association to present itself to the county security committee before police hunt them down. According to Ngumo, the group has been conducting illegal meetings meant to divide communities on the basis of tribalism. He said the group’s flag bearers should appear before the security agencies for clarification and registration. Ngumo, who was speaking on Thursday during the marking of Jamhuri day in Mkongani ward in Matuga sub-county, said the group and many others have become a major threat to county security. “These people are propagating hate speech and inciting communities against each other risking the only peace that we are proud to have,” said Ngumo. Meanwhile, Ngumo has permanently banned the Taireni association from holding any meetings. He also cautioned communities from doing public gatherings without following legal procedures. He warned that police officers shall arrest anyone who will be leading illegitimate rallies demanding the locals to seek assistance from area chiefs before conducting any public sittings. “Let my message go to everyone around if you want to form a group or meetings kindly use the grassroots security leaders. Failure to that, police will apprehend and charge you in a court of law,” he said. Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya condemned the act and called for peace among the people. He warmed the residents against being divided on political and ethnic backgrounds saying that the nation is bigger than a self-malicious interest of an individual. Mvurya told leaders to peacefully sell their manifestos without necessarily using the divide and rule policy, terming it as uncivilized and out fashioned. “If you want votes, kindly present your agendas like gentlemen. Inciting people is uncalled for and that’s primitive,” Mvurya said.
