South Africa's state-owned rail company has been put into administration. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has dissolved the interim board, saying it had done nothing to improve services. The Passenger Rail Agency has been accused of irregular expenditure amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. The company has been beset by other problems, including ordering trains that were not suited for South African rail lines. The country's transport sector has been struggling in recent months. The state-owned airline company, South African Airways, is close to financial collapse, with flights grounded in November due to strike action.
