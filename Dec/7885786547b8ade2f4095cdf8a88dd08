A Makadara court has issued warrants of arrest against two directors of Solai dam who failed to appear in court to answer forgery charges. Manshukhlal Shantilal Patel and Perry Manshukh Kansagra are accused of forging a title deed of a Sh2 billion parcel within Kiang’ombe in Embakasi. According to the charges, the two between July 1, 1985 and July 13 1994 conspired to commit a felony by forging a title deed of the land belonging to Tafflus Manufacturers. The duo also faces charges of forcibly detaining the parcel of land, which is valued at Sh2 billion. Lawi Kigen and James Wainaina were arraigned before Senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji with the same offence but only Wainaina pleaded not guilty to the charges of forging the title deed. Wainaina was also charged with forging a sale agreement of the title deed on the same dates in Embakasi. He was released on a bond of Sh1 million and the case will be mentioned on January 6, 2020. Kigen through his lawyer Wiliam Arusei however had made an application seeking to defer the plea, saying the charges were premature. He said he has a pending matter at the High Court on the same issue. The lawyer added that Kigen was being frustrated because he was a complainant in the matter at the High Court involving the land dispute. He pleaded with the court to differ his plea taking pending the outcome of the matter before the High court. “At this stage this charge sheet does not even disclose the offence. Kigen is the rightful owner of the disputed land at the High Court and charging him at this stage will be unfair trial,” Arusei added.
