 With ominous signs that his team is going to be involved in a relegation scrap, Nzoia United chairman Yappets Mokua betrays no intention of wielding the axe on the clubs' technical bench headed by coach Collins 'Korea' Omondi. The grapevine was rife with stories that Omondi, a former goalkeeping coach at Mathare United and Kariobangi Sharks,was ready to throw in the towel and step down from his role at the club. Mokua, however, dismissed those rumours and insisted Korea will remain in charge of the team for the foreseeable future. The Nzoia boss said the abject form that has seen them manage a measly ten points from twelve matches cannot be pinned solely on the coach. “I have not entertained the idea of sacking the coach. His future is safe,”Mokua emphasised “As the chairman, I can't be blind to the circumstances under which our coaching staff and players are working. Our recent performances are down to a combination of many things,” observed Mokua. Mokua admitted that there was immense pressure from the Sudi faithful for the team to compete with neighboring clubs such as Western Stima,Kakamega Homeboyz and even financially stable sides like Tusker. “I think we must all be realistic. The team is working under a tight budget and we must, therefore, control our expectation particularly this season,” he stated “The players and the coaches are doing their best in a tough environment. As the management , hat is all we ask for,”Mokua finished. Like many clubs based in the sugar belt areas of Nyanza and Western Kenya, Nzoia has been on a rough financial patch in recent years. Their benefactors Nzoia Sugar company has endured harsh financial times, severing their full-time sponsorship of the club. The club is now down in 14th place —just two points above the relegation/promotion playoff spot occupied by Kariobangi Sharks. They will be hoping to end their run of five matches without a win on Sunday when they take on high flying Western Stima.
