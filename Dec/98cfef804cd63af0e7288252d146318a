An Administration Police officer has been charged with rape at the Lamu law courts. Constable Rodgers Ouma, attached to the Lamu Administration Police line in Lamu town, allegedly lured and raped the woman at his residence at the lines on December 8. The cop also faced two alternative charges of committing an indecent act with an adult where he intentionally and unlawfully touched the sexual organ of the woman with his organ against her will. The other alternative charge was that he took advantage of his position as a police officer to indecently assault and rape the woman. The officer denied all the charges before Lamu senior Resident Magistrate Victor Asiyo and insisted that he did not know the woman in question and that he had no idea why he was being accused of rape. The prosecution, led by Zacharia Kagenyo, pleaded with the court to deny the officer bond as he is likely to interfere with investigations and intimidate the victim and witnesses. The bond ruling will be made on December 31. Activists in Lamu have lauded the DCI in the region for ensuring the officer is charged. Haki Africa’s Yunus Issakia incidents involving police officers rarely make it to court. “We are impressed by the DCI office here for taking on this case and ensuring it proceeds as required. We believe justice will be served,” he said.
