County governments have been urged to train Kenyans on lifesaving skills and disaster management. Kenya Lifesavers Federation secretary general Sally Indili said if people are not trained, it becomes difficult to get rescuers when need arises. She spoke in Magomano village, Kipipiri, Nyandarua county, where she has been leading a team of divers to retrieve the bodies of Samuel Njenga, 27, and Francis Gathumbi, 10, who drowned in River Malewa on Tuesday last week. Gathumbi's body was recovered on Sunday. The search for Njenga's body is still on. A Nakuru-based team was called to retrieve the bodies because there were no divers in Nyandarua and the police and residents could not find the bodies. Indili said in Nakuru, where her team is based, she had requested the government to allow her to train five people from each of the 11 constituencies in the county. “It is not just rivers, people also have dams. We have also removed bodies from wells. The communities don’t have to call us if they know what to do," she said Further, she said, both levels of government need to invest in mental health to curb the rising cases of suicides, especially among men. “A lot of people need to be trained and talked to. We need to do motivational talks to help the community understand that you don’t take your life and think you have solved the problem. In fact, you have made it worse because the family is left in a dilemma,” she said
