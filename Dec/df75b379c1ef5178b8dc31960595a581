The National Treasury has released a total of Sh11 billion to 18 counties. Acting Treasury CS Ukur Yatani in a circular on Wednesday said the 18 counties had presented clear and acceptable plans for settlement of validated pending bills.

Last month, the government issued a directive asking the county governments and State departments that had not cleared their pending bills to do so before November 30. All the affected counties and departments had been urged by Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua to indicate that they are willing to settle the matter by reporting to his office. President Uhuru Kenyatta had ordered the state ministries, departments and agencies during Madaraka Day celebrations to clear their pending bills. "Note that the government has made a commitment to complete these payments by 30th November 2019. I urge everyone involved to take the necessary measures to meet the deadline," part of Joseph Kinyua's statement read. Most counties seemed to have ignored Uhuruâ€™s directive, sending most contractors and suppliers into problems. During the Madaraka Day event, Uhuru gave two directives, including compelling state corporations from trading in treasury bills and directing the state corporations to clear pending bills from the suppliers. Fifteen counties had by then not cleared their pending bills. This move saw the Senate ask the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to probe the Sh130 billion pending bills in counties, amid claims of inflation and fictitious amounts owed to contractors. The lawmakers wanted DCI boss George Kinoti and DPP Noordin Haji to swiftly swing into action and unravel the mystery behind the ballooning bills across the 47 county governments.
