St Etienne have been ordered to play their Ligue 1 matches behind closed doors until further notice for “wide use of fireworks” in the stands during Sunday’s home defeat by Paris St Germain, the French Football League (LFP) said. The home supporters set off flares and fireworks at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard as PSG forward Kylian Mbappe fired home an 89th-minute goal in a 4-0 win for the visitors. The referee was forced to blow the whistle in the last minute and stoppage time was not played. “In view of the particularly serious facts, there will be a total closed-door measure,” the LFP said in a statement. Paris St Germain extended their lead at the top of the Ligue 1 standings to seven points with a game in hand, courtesy of two goals from Mbappe and one each from Neymar and Mauro Icardi. Elsewhere, India’s soccer governing body (AIFF) said it has launched an investigation into allegations a Saudi Arabian referee made racist remarks about Mumbai City FC’s Gabonese forward Serge Kevyn. The Mumbai side alleges Turki Mohammed Al Khudayr made the remarks about Kevyn, who has represented Gabon eight times, in Sunday’s Indian Super League (ISL) match against Bengaluru FC, the AIFF said in a statement. “The All India Football Federation follows a zero tolerance policy against racism and the complaint has been forwarded to the disciplinary committee to investigate into the matter and take appropriate action if found guilty,” it said. The clubs did not wish to comment on the matter. Mumbai are sixth in the 10-team ISL and scored the winner in injury time for a 3-2 away victory in Sunday’s match. Last month the owners of Premier League champions Manchester City agreed to buy 65% of Mumbai City FC, expanding their global stable of clubs to eight in countries from China to Japan to the United States. The ISL is promoted by billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and TV network Star India, which is owned by Walt Disney. \
