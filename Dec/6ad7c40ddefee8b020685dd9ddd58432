A senior adviser to DRC President Felix Tshisekedi has died in a Nairobi hotel. Gilbert Mundela died of a heart attack at Radisson Blu Hotel in Nairobi while attending a regional conference, ODM leader Raila Odinga said yesterday. Raila, a close friend of Tshisekedi, revealed that pathologist Siele Chepng 'eno’s report confirmed he died of a heart attack. A requiem mass will be held at Holy Family Basilica on Monday morning before the body is flown to Kinshasa. Speaking after viewing the body at Lee Funeral home yesterday, Raila said some family members are already in Nairobi but others, among them his children, are yet to jet in from the US. Raila sent a message of condolences to the people of DRC for, “losing such an industrious son who has fought for change and democracy almost all his adult life.” "We are mourning with them and sympathize with their situation," he said. Raila was accompanied by Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Ny'ong'o alongside the deceased's family members.
