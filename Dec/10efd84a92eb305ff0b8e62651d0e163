Elsewhere, Kabras head coach Hennley Du Plessis has cited poor decision making for the narrow 20-17 defeat to Homeboyz . A visibly disappointed Du Plessis said the team needs to go back to the drawing board following the shock defeat. "We made bad decisions and didn’t make the right calls especially in the last minutes of the game. We had a penalty in the last minute and we could have gone for points but we didn’t. So the decision making from senior players was poor,” added Du Plessis The Kakamega-based side will be seeking to bounce back before the Christmas and New Year holidays with a win against Menengai Oilers at home on Saturday
