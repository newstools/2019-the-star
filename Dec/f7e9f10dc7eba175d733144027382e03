A man has been charged in a Kiambu court for forging a title deed for more than two acres in Karen worth Sh350 million. Stanley Kieti Samson on Wednesday appeared before senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo and denied charges of forgery. Samson is charged that on March 21, 2016 with intent to defraud Kenyan Alliance Insurance Company Limited of a parcel of land in Karen, he forged a title deed purporting it to be a genuine. Samson denied a second charge of obtaining registration of land by pretence at Ardhi House, Nairobi. Atambo granted the accused person Sh25 million bond with two sureties of the same amount and slated the hearing for February 27, 2020. He purported to have bought the land from Anthony William Austin Down and Celeste Down while knowing that the same land was already registered in the name of Kenya Alliance Insurance Company Limited. Prosecutor Donnex Ongira told the court that he had no objection to the accused being granted bail but the court should look into the nature of the offence while granting bail. The defense counsel asked the court to give the accused favourable bond terms and be supplied with the witness statements and all materials that the prosecution wished to use in the matter.
