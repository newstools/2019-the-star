The government will post 10,000 new intern teachers in January, Teachers Service Commission CEO Nancy Macharia has said. She said the new teachers will ease the shortage in public secondary across the country. Macharia said all the students who did their KCPE in 2019 will have space in secondary schools. She also appreciated teachers who took part in this year's exam process. She said the discipline level was impressive and that she had not received cases of indiscipline. "In this year's national exams, we recorded the least number of cases of reported teachers involved in irregularities," Macharia said. She, however, said that the commission will take action against teachers who will are implicated. The TSC boss added that the process to replace departed teachers due to natural calamities and those who have retired is in place. She spoke on Wednesday at Knec headquarters during the release of KCSE results. Private school proprietors have been asked to desist from employing unregistered teachers. Macharia said that the majority of irregularity cases being reported are emerging from the private schools. She further asked the Ministry of education to take firm action against private school proprietors who will be found to have taken part in irregularities and employed unregistered teachers. A total of 699,745 students sat for this year's examinations which were concluded on November 27. The 14-day marking process started on November 28 and came to an end on December 12 and Knec officials started to analyse the results.
