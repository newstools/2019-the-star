University of Eldoret are placed 10th on the log and welcome leaders Strathmore Leos at home in the first of a double header starting 1pm. Trojans lost 33-9 against Mean Machine while Leos got a walkover after troubled Kisii RFC failed to honour their game. Leos lead the log with 38 points while Trojans have 15 points. In the second game, Eldoret RFC will entertain sixth placed Mean Machine. Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST) under the tutelage of Ochieng Ahaya host South Coast Pirates in Kakamega. MMUST, who have lost one game and sit second on the log with 30 points, will be hoping to maintain their second place with a win against Trojans. Fourth-placed Northern Suburbs play cash-trapped Kisi RFC at Gusii Stadium. Suburbs, coached by Simon Jawichire, will seek their fifth win of the season with Kisii going for their first points of the season having been docked six points for missing three games. The former Kenya Cup side has failed to honour three away matches due to financial constraints. Coach Eric Bosire is hoping for a better tiding in the second legÂ  and said his main target at the moment is to avoid relegation.
