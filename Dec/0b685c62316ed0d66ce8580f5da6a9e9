Residents of Naleera village in Budalang'i fear a possible cholera outbreak following an underground water seepage from the northern dykes of River Nzoia. The water has flooded their homes. Speaking to the Star at his home on Wednesday, victim Joseph Madioba accused the national government of failing to address the problems they have been facing for many years. He said they continue to lose property to floods. “We have complained to the government several times about the underground water seepage from the northern dykes of River Nzoia that has been flooding our homes but our pleas have fallen on deaf ears,” he said. A spot check by the Star has, however, established that most homesteads and farms in Bunyala West ward are flooded. The victims said Bunyala deputy county commissioner Jacob Ruto has visited the affected homes and has assured them that the government will take urgent steps to address the challenges they are facing.
