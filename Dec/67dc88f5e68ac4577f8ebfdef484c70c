Christmas is highly marked and celebrated around the world. But today's Christmas is dwindling down without much fun and merry as it was decades ago. The high cost of living in this country, for instance, has put off most of the people from the celebrations. There's no more merry, there's no fun, there's no more pomp and colour and Christmas trees, lights or flowers or Christmas carols. A day like this a whole night would be lit with Christmas lights and we would go singing Christmas Carols from house to house. Today, however, you can't dare do this because of the high level of insecurity. The economic tough times have brought about insecurity: Some  Kenyans want to live on the sweat of others making Christmas lack merry. Happy Christmas although it lacks the merry.  MOMBASA
