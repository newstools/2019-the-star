A 36-year-old woman was on Thursday trampled to death an elephant in Ol Arabel forest in Baringo County. The Kenya Wildlife Service in a statement on Friday said the woman, Ms Stella Chebii had reportedly gone looking for her stray livestock in the forest when she was attacked by the jumbo near the border of Laikipia and Baringo counties. KWS officers and the police collected the body from the scene and moved it to Nyahururu Hospital Mortuary. "We are reaching out to the family of the deceased to condole with them. Members of the public are cautioned to be vigilant, particularly when they approach forest areas," KWS said. The organisation has in the meantime mobilised problem animal control teams to monitor elephant movement in the area which has experienced an influx of elephants in the area. In August, two men were hospitalised on Thursday after they were attacked by elephants in separate incidences in Baringo North. Daniel Chesire, 28, was attacked at Tanyilel village while primary school teacher Jackson Chepyegon, 40, in Barwessa. KWS deputy warden for Baringo David Cheruiyot said the elephant was guided back to Kamnarok National Game Reserve.
