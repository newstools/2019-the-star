Kenya’s representatives Serani High School began their Coca Cola Africa Cup title defence on a poor note, losing 3-1 to Zimbabwe at the Mpesa Academy grounds in Thika. Kenya must now win against Mozambique to progress to the quarters. Coach Daniel Lenjo said the coastal side will need to improve on their defence to progress after failing to keep up the pace with Zims on the waterlogged pitch. “The field was unsuitable but we can’t dwell on that. We need technical and tactical discipline in defence to win our next match and move to the next stage. We are under no pressure at all and hopefully, the team will find the winning touch in the next match,” he noted. Zimbabwe coach Mathias Mauto admitted that it was a hard-fought victory against the defending champions and hopes the win against the defending champions will inject more confidence in his playing unit. He said: “It thrills me to beat defending champions. The pitch was pathetic but we can’t control nature. The win gives us a proper platform to prepare for the next match.” Kenya were the better side in the opening minutes and were guilty of spurning clear-cut chances with wing wizard Kamalu Ali and striker  Mwinyi Nassoro the culprits as Zimbabwe defended resolutely. The visitors, however, grew into the game and took the lead in the 30th minute through the hat-trick hero Luke Musikiri. However, their lead lasted only five minutes before Kenya restored parity on the stroke of half-time. After the restart, Kenya traded Fredrick Onyango for Kamalu Ali as Juma Shaban replaced Nassoro Mwinyi but Zims were never going to be denied. Musikiri added his second in the 51st minute and completed his hat-trick seven minutes later with a cool finish. Zimbabwe took command in the three-team Pool ‘A’. Ten teams have graced this year’s second edition of the U-16 tournament. Inaugural winners St. Anthony, Kitale were bundled out at the national level. Kenya face Mozambique later today.
