Joblessness is pushing young people in Nyeri to terrorism, alcohol and drug abuse among other social ills, three leaders have said. Speaker John Kaguchia, Chinga MCA Kiruga Thuku and Majority leader James Kanyugo spoke on Sunday at Kariki ACK church in Othaya when they delivered Sh1 million donated by deputy president William Ruto. They called on the security operators to help raise security awareness in the country. Kaguchia said security awareness could curtail plans by terrorists to execute attacks in the country. “You are already aware that we had a very major blow in Somalia where a lot of Somalis and other nationals were bombed.  We believe it could be possible that what happened in Somalia was just a precursor of what they may want to do,” he said. “And because we have suffered from this before, we want to ask our security apparatus to help us as a country to ensure that all our people are sensitised so that we do not get into the same trap as we have had in the past." Thuku said youths have been ensnared by drugs and substance abuse due to poverty and lack of jobs. He advised youths to heed  DP Ruto’s call to join Technical and Vocational Education and Training institutions and benefit from subsidised skills training. Kanyugo said alcoholism is a big problem in the county "and must be addressed by all leaders". Young people have been lost in alcoholism but leaders from the assembly will always support initiatives to help young people, he said. The donation had been promised to the church in September when Ruto donated another Sh1 million and delivered President Uhuru Kenyatta's Sh1 million. The event, which was also marked as the End-of-YearThanksgiving service, was attended by 20 MCAs. “Already the committee has set aside some funds and we have four young men who are undergoing rehabilitation at a centre in Nairobi,” he said. He said the church has also set aside some cash this January to be used as a bursary for 10 needy children. Edited by R.Wamochie
