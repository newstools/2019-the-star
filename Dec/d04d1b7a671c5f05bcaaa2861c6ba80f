Social media is awash with images and videos of Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko being arrested on Friday. In one of the videos, Governor Sonko is heard crying in pain, probably as a result of the manhandling by the police officers who surrounded him. His supporters and sympathisers are of the view that the police mishandled the governor, used excessive and unnecessary force during the arrest. They say the governor should have been handled differently, to befit his status as a leader. The police are often accused wrongly, depending on which side one stands. To begin with, the governor himself didn't handle himself better, even attempting to resist arrest, which his lawyers deny. In such an event, the arresting officers must escalate the use of force to counter and subdue the culprit. It is shameful for leaders to defy arrest from uniformed officers, who are executing lawful orders. Governors and other political leaders expect to be treated differently, even when being pursued for criminal cases. Let me remind them that they aren't special or above the law. When they commit a crime, they should not expect red carpet treatment. Police should equally apply lethal force on individuals endangering their lives during an arrest. Sonko is known for his drama to attract public sympathy and support. As he delayed his arrest, he was expecting his battalion of supporters to emerge and complicate the situation for the arresting officers. Things could have gone haywire. I have seen Sonko slap and violate people as if his victims don't feel pain or don't deserve better. I, therefore, don't understand why he was crying. I urge the investigative agencies to tighten the noose on the thieving governors across the country and make them pay for their sins. We must raise the bar on leadership and integrity, weeding out sheep in wolves skin. Shalom DCI, shalom DPP Migori
