The Alcohol Beverages Association of Kenya (ABAK) has asked bar owners and distributors to avoid unnecessary hiking of beer prices during this festive season. The association has also called on alcohol retailers to stick to the Recommended Retail Prices (RRP) to avoid overpricing revelers out of legal, safe and hygienic liquor. The association's Chairman Gordon Mutugi in a statement said taking advantage of the festivities to make extra cash by overpricing customers beyond the recommended retail price is counterproductive because it drives consumers to cheaper, harmful alternatives which Is unsustainable for their businesses. Mutugi said Despite well-spelt out prices that are often published in the media for all to see and adhere to, it is not uncommon to see some retailers hiking prices beyond the recommended ranges. “This exaggerated pricing does not only make it difficult for our consumers to enjoy their favorite tipple, some find it difficult to access and result to cheap and often illicit brands or commute to look for fairer prices elsewhere,” he said. He said the association’s emphasis is for the retailers to offer good value to their customers. "For those retailers who trade in a competitive environment and do over-price, this is a false economy which will only benefit you in the short term," he said. Mutugi added, "If retailers really want to grow their business, they have to offer value to consumers otherwise buyers will take their money elsewhere, meaning that in addition to lost sales, goodwill across other categories will also be lost". Mutugi further cautioned Kenyans to avoid drunk driving to avoid mishaps on the road during the festive season. “A driver’s judgment and ability to react are both impaired when driving after excessive consumption of alcohol. Consumers are strongly advised to consider the use of taxis or designated drivers whenever they indulge. Our challenge to drivers is try to remain sober on the roads and drive safe,” he said.
