Kenya's Harambee Stars began their defence of the Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup with a tough 1-0 win over fellow contenders Tanzania. Bandari forward Hassan Abdalla accounted for the lone goal after  only five minutes  in the match played in  Kampala, Uganda. The win  meant that Stars moved top of Group 'B'   with three points after Sudan and Zanzibar had fought out a 1-1 draw in the first match of the pool. Gor Mahia defender Joash Onyango was given the honours of captaining Stars in their title defence ahead of his club leader, Kenneth Muguna. Veteran Kevin Kimani, was handed a start as was towering Ulinzi Stars striker Oscar Wamalwa. Sweden-based Anthony Wambani was named in midfield alongside Muguna, Lawrence Juma, Kimani and Hassan as Francis Kimanzi looked to take the game to the Kilimanjaro Stars. Western Stima goalkeeper and set-piece taker Samuel Odhiambo was tasked between the posts and had  Johnstone Omurwa, David Owino and Samuel Olwande for cover alongside Joash. All will feel pleased with a good days work for keeping the Tanzanians at bay.Stars had a dream start to what was expected to be their toughest  group B match with  Abdalla netting the opener from which they went on to clinch the victory. Kenya's next match will be tomorrow when  they take on Sudan. Victory in that match will see  the holders book a semi final berth.
