Lamu west MP Stanley Muthama has asked religious leaders in the region to avail copies of the Building Bridges Initiative report to their respective congregations. Muthama proposed that the reports be made readily available in churches and mosques for easy access by congregants. Speaking in Lamu on Tuesday, Muthama also urged religious leaders to read and understand the BBI report so that they can be in a position to help their congregations better understand the contents of the report. The MP said the move is necessary to enable people make informed decisions on whether or not to support the BBI. He said churches and mosques are better placed to also conduct civic education on the report to help their congregations better understand it. Muthama said the BBI is crucial in fostering peace and unity as it promises an all inclusive government free from tribalism. He urged Lamu people to support it. “The mistake many people are making is that they are politicking and haven't even read the report. Thats why I am calling on religious leaders here to step up and ensure they have copies of the BBI report in their places of worship for people to acquaint themselves with it. But having read the report myself, I urge people to support it. Trust me, we need that report to make Kenya better,” said Muthama.
