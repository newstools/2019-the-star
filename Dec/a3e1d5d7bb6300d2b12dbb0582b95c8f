Homeboyz coach Jason Hector has lauded his team's defence following  the stunning 20-17 victory over Kabras last weekend. The win ended the sugar millers unbeaten start to the season and saw  their lead at the top of the log slashed to a point by champions KCB who beat Impala 15-5. Hector said he tweaked the game plan for his charges, adding that the hunger and execution in all facets of play worked to the team's advantage. “Our line speed on defence was excellent. We knew Kabras are a great attacking team so we had to match the intensity on defence and we kept our composure until the end of the match,” added Hector. Hector lauded the team set-pieces which laid a foundation for the win. "Our scrum and line out were superb. We disrupted a lot of the Kabras throw-ins the line-out and our scrum was able to get penalties,” he noted. Homeboyz now sit third on the log with 33 points and face Mwamba this weekend. "We are taking one match at a time. We can't get carried away because the boys are aware it is a  long  season and we must stay focused and grounded,” said Hector. Max Kangeri and Abel Mutanda scored a try each for the deejays with Evin Asena adding two penalties and a conversion. Jone Kubu and Paul Abuto scored a try each for Kabras with Kubu adding two conversions and a penalty. Impala stay fourth on the log on 25 points following the defeat by the bankers. Menengai Oilers thrashed bottom of the log Kisumu RFC 57-18 to earn a bonus-point win and move up to fifth on the log with 24 points. Mwamba stay sixth on 20 points after a 15- 5 defeat to Western Bulls in Kakamega. A resurgent Nakuru RFC continued with their trajectory after a bonus point 36-18 demolition of Blak Blad to sit seventh on the log with 20 points. Nondies are eighth after edging out Quins 26-8. Kisumu are at the bottom of the log with four points.
