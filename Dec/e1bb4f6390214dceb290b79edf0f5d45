Kenya Swimming Federation interim chairman Patrick Muyah hopes to conduct elections in the first quarter of the new year after temporal suspension by world governing body, Fina last week. "I am confident the election will be held. We only have very minor details  to work on before carrying on with the exercise and all the stakeholders will agree” added Muyah. Muyah said the governance committee will have to work with speed in the first two months of the year to address issues raised by FINA and ensure consensus “ With the suspension now in place time is not on our side. 2022 is a big year with the various international meetings and the Olympics,” added Muyah. He said they have to consult with Sports Registrar Rose Wasike on the clubs to vote during the election. Most of the clubs have not complied with Sports Act and may need temporary licences to participate. Stakeholders have called for a forensic audit of the Kenya Swimming Federation accounts as well as governance issues. Fina have also requested  the profiles of candidates taking part in elections to see if they pass the integrity test. Kenya failed to meet an October 30th deadline for the exercise  amid ongoing conflicts in the local swimming circles. October was the second deadline after they missed the  earlier  June 30th deadline. Speaking recently, Sports Dispute Tribunal (SDT) chairman John Ohaga said a lot of issues needed to be addressed before the polls are held. " Obviously we need to have consensus on issue like the accounts and the clubs that are going to vote. We can't be in a rush to just do elections yet some issues could come back to haunt us,” added Ohaga. Fina also approved the swimming qualifying time standards for both the 2020 and 2021 World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan.
