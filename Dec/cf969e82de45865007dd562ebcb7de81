Isiolo Governor Mohamed Kuti has formed a disaster coordination team to lead floods response after Ewaso Nyiro River burst its banks. The flooding has caused the marooning of tourist lodges and settlements within the county. The governor and county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri will chair the team. They will coordinate efforts to avert further suffering and restore normalcy. Kuti spoke when he addressed residents during Jamhuri Day celebration at Isiolo police mess. He said the county disaster committee will work closely with humanitarian and other relevant agencies to mitigate dangers. The county chief said four trucks have been dispatched to Gafarsa, Erasaboru and other areas to help those affected. Heavy rains upstream yesterday continued to cause havoc in parts of Upper Eastern region. It led to the disruption of services in almost all the tourist class lodges and camps situated along Ewaso Nyiro River. Residents of Gafarsa and Ngaremara were caught unawares after floods marooned their villages, destroying property and displacing them. Kuti said the committee and other stakeholders have been dispatched to visit and establish the extent of damage caused by the river. He advised those living along the river bank to move to higher grounds for safety. The county government is working with the national government to ensure timely intervention to help those affected and restore normalcy. Transport services were disrupted in most of the areas after roads were destroyed, making it difficult for the locals to access food. Also present at the Jamhuri Day celebrations were Senator Fatuma Dullo, Isiolo South MP Abdi Koropu, Isiolo North MP Hassan Odha and Woman Representative Rehema Jaldesa
