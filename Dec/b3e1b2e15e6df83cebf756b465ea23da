The World Bank has given Vihiga farmers Sh105 million through the National Agricultural and Rural Inclusive growth project. This is the second disbursement of the Sh535 million grant expected to be given to over 500 farmers' groups by 2022. Speaking during the presentation of the cheque to farmers in Hamisi subcounty, Governor Wilber Ottichilo said his government is committed to boosting agribusiness. He urged the youths to draft proposals and apply for the cash and invest in agribusiness. “I know the time and energy required in proposal writing and praise farmers for being dedicated and writing proposals to qualify for funding,” Ottichilo said. The governor said groups producing on small scale will be supported financially to increase their produce for the factories. Targeted groups include Banana, Chicken and Dairy cooperative societies and local vegetable value chains. He urged Agriculture CEC Pamela Kimwele to reach all members of Banana Cooperative Society for benchmarking in Kisii where they have started processing their products. “By 2022, Vihiga should be at a place of selling products of value-added tax only,” Ottichilo said. He urged farmers to invest in smart agriculture to speed up their productivity. Vihiga has a favourable climate for agriculture, the governor said, urging farmers to scale up from subsistence farming to agribusiness. Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi said the county assembly has been cordially cooperating with the executive to address the issue of pending bills. “We are forced to factor over Sh400 million to settle the huge pending bills as directed by the national government. So we are forced to suspend some programmes like giving out fertilisers, seedlings and other support to our farmers,” Saisi said. Kimwele said agribusiness is the new frontier in agriculture "as it leaves farmers with some cash in their pockets". Edited by R.Wamochie
