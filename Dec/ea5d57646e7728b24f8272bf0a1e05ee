Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi has urged the national government to increase the Disaster Management Fund to compensate those left destitute by floods. He also called for the harvest of the floodwaters that drain into the Indian Ocean after causing death and destruction in places such as Kitui. “Those who have lost their loved ones should be compensated using the funds and everyone else directly affected by floods,” Mulyungi said. The legislator said it was a shame that more than 50 years since Independence Kenya has not made use of simple technology to harvest rainwater. He said the government should find a way of saving lives during rainy seasons. “If it rains, more lives are lost unlike in dry seasons. I feel the government should be prepared for rains, whether heavy or minimal.” Women and children in many parts of Ukambani traverse the countryside for kilometres searching for water in dry seasons. Mulyungi spoke after the burial of Teresia Mumbe, who drowned in a swollen river on her way home from a friend’s burial. “Teresia Mumbe met her cruel death when she tried crossing a swollen river on her way home from a friend’s burial,” he said. Scores of people have died since the rains started. Thousands have been rendered homeless and property worth millions of shillings lost.
