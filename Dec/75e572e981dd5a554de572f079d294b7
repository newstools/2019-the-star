A police officer was on Tuesday charged at a Nairobi court for conspiring to steal over Sh2 million from an insurance company after claiming his limbs were amputated. Dominic Lusweti was charged alongside David Ichere forÂ conspiring to steal Sh2,440,320 from Pioneer Assurance on diverse dates between September 22 and 2018 and September 5, 2019, jointly with others not before the court. The duo was also charged with obtaining the Sh2.4 million by falsely pretending that Lusweti had been previously involved in an accident and both his right upper and lower limbs were amputated. The two were also charged with forging a Kenya National Police Service signal and presenting it to Irene Njagi while purporting that it was a genuine document sent by the base commander Mwingi of the Kenya National Police Service. The suspects also faced several other counts of faking traffic accident abstracts, medical documents, impressed stamps and uttering them to various offices. Appearing before senior principal magistrate Peter Ooko, the two denied all the charges preferred against them and through their advocate Brian Khaemba sought affordable bail terms. The court granted the two Sh500,000 cash bail and Sh 1 million bond each. The matter will be mentioned on December 17 and heard on March 16.
