Despite a run of just one win in five games Manchester City are not low on confidence and it is important to analyse performances not just results, says manager Pep Guardiola. City drew 2-2 at Newcastle United on Saturday, leaving the champions 11 points adrift of leaders Liverpool. The result comes after defeat by Liverpool and victory over Chelsea in the Premier League and a pair of draws in the Champions League. “You have to see how the players run, how far, how they try and the body language. We never give up. The team is always there, that is my feeling,” Guardiola told reporters. “You (the media) analyse the result. Of course, it’s not good for us. I know it doesn’t count but I have to analyse the performance. The performance was good.” City will have a chance to get back on track when they visit Burnley tonight before rivals Manchester United head for the Etihad Stadium on Saturday. Meanwhile, Guardiola is 'open' to the idea of a new contract with the Premier League champions. The 48-year-old Spaniard was appointed in 2016 and signed a contract extension last year until 2021. No talks have yet been held with City chiefs, but Guardiola said: "I'm so comfortable working with this club. "When you are [somewhere for] five years it depends on the results. We will see what happens this season and next season." Guardiola spent four years in charge at Barcelona, winning La Liga three times and the Champions League twice. He left the Catalan giants in the summer of 2012 and after a short sabbatical began a three-year spell at Bayern Munich in 2013, winning the Bundesliga in each of his three seasons in Germany. Having won the Premier League for the past two seasons, plus the FA Cup and two League Cups, Guardiola said of staying on: "I'm open [to it], yes. It is not about what the club wants or not. For me, I want to see my players and the reaction of my players and everything.
