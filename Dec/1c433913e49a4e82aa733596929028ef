Rayton Okwiri has promised to stop his opponent in the sixth round when he puts his African Boxing Union (ABU) title on the line at Charter Hall today. Okwiri will take on DRC Champion Augustine Matata in a 12-round scheduled contest which is his first defence. The former Kenya team mainstay yesterday paid a courtesy call to the Sports CS Amina Mohammed well in time for the 12-round content. Okwiri displayed his title to the Cabinet Secretary, who will be the chief guest at tomorrow’s fight. “I am not taking the DRC opponent for granted. All I am saying is that I have studied his style and if my game plan is anything to go by, then he should hit the canvas after six rounds. “He doesn’t box. He is only a fighter who wants to go for the kill time and time again. My training is all good and my fans should expect a great fight tomorrow (today),” said Okwiri. He will be hoping to use his fight to seek bigger belts overseas. In another flight, Maurice Okola aka Maketho will fight in an ABU heavyweight eliminator against Malawian Limbani Lano in an 8- rounder. The occasion will also give spectators some exhilarating displays of women’s boxing artistry. Evelyn Odero is set to take on Joyce Awino in a non-title contest while Sarah Achieng’ has a date with Mercy Nasimiyu in a non-title contest. Former Kenya international Nicodemus Otieno aka Kamyankole will be up against Joshua Osothi in an eight-round non-title. The fight is sanctioned by the Kenya Professional Boxing Commission under the chairmanship of Reuben Ndolo. Ndolo urged fans to come in large numbers to witness high quality contests. “We are glad to have the cabinet Secretary as our special guest during the fight. We expect our local boxers to give their all and hope to have a great occasion of boxing. This is one of the many fights we will be using to empower our boxers countrywide,” Ndolo said.
