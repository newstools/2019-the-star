Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei yesterday confirmed he had been served with all the documentary evidence in the case he faces incitement to violence charges. “We have received a folder with nine witness statements and six including an audio-visual disk,” Cherargei through his lawyer confirmed. The senator is facing charges of ethnic contempt, violating the National Cohesion and Integration Act following a speech he made in August in Nandi. He allegedly said, "Hii Kenya sisi si squatters, na wakitaka hii Kenya tutakanyagana mpaka wajue hawajui ama tufunge hii Kenya." This loosely translates as, "We are not squatters in Kenya and if they want, we will crush each other until they know that they actually don't know or we close down this country." He is said to have committed the offence while addressing a gathering during a fundraiser for Kilibwoni Football Club. The court heard that the words were calculated to stir ethnic hatred by the Kalenjin community against other Kenyan communities. The senator faces a second count of incitement to violence, allegedly committed on the same date at Kilibwoni Primary School in Nandi. He denied the charges before Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi and sought to be released on a lenient cash bail and bond terms. The prosecution did not oppose bail but sought a gag order against Cherargei. The court noted that he is a public figure and declined to issue a gag order. Instead it told him to refrain from commenting negatively over the allegations. If he breaches that directive he will violate his bail and bond terms. He was a released on a Sh300,000 cash bail. The matter will be mentioned on February 12 and trial commences on April 29.
