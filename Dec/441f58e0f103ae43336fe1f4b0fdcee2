Some 200 elderly women in Imenti North are the beneficiaries of free gas cylinders from nominated Meru MP Halima Mucheke. Halima said during the donation on Sunday that the gas cylinders were intended to improve the health the women aged 50 and above as they will no longer have to walk long distances to the forest in search of firewood. This will also conserve the environment. “The gas cylinders will help in reducing deforestation as the elderly women depend on trees for firewood. They will no longer suffer respiratory diseases because they will not inhale smoke,” she said at Runogone Methodist Church. The Inua Mama Jubilee MP had in October, alongside Deputy President William Ruto, raised more than Sh3 million for 150 women's groups in Meru for economic empowerment. Halima lashed out at politicians critical of her projects. “A few days ago, some leaders criticised me. Let them stop divisive politics. Nothing will stop me from uplifting our people.” She said her development projects money comes from Inua Mama and contributions from well-off Imenti North women. “I could not do this without the assistance of some women from this region and funds from our women group known as Inua Mama,” Halima said. She said it was wrong for some women to register more than five groups and locking out other needy women. “We have over 2,000 groups. I have been giving money to one person in about five groups,” she said.
