Broke former Kenya Cup side Kisii RFC are in danger of being relegated from the KRU Championship after dishing out a second walkover. The Kisii-based side failed to honour their second game of the season against Catholic Monks over the weekend at the Catholic University of East Africa in Langata. Kisii also failed to honour their game against United States International University’s Martials and are now a game away from being throw out of the Championship. Consequently, the club has lost four points for failing to honour the two games and remain rooted at the bottom of the log with just one point. The club’s troubles started when Resolution Insurance withdrew their sponsorship. Club treasurer told The Star the club is broke. At the same time, log leaders Strathmore Leos and second-placed Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST) maintained their 100 per cent record in the league winning their sixth consecutive game. Leos thrashed United States International University 38-3  to record a bonus-point win while MMUST beat hosts Mean Machine 18-16 in a blockbuster clash at the University of Nairobi to confirm their intention of qualifying for Kenya Cup. Leos lead the log with 29 points while MMUST maintained second place four points behind. In a battle of debutants, Simon Jawichire’s Northern Suburbs saw off Eldoret RFC 36-13. Following the win, Suburbs climbed to third place with 18 points.  Machine are fourth with 17 points. South Coast Pirates beat Egerton Wasps 13-7 to move to fifth with 12 points. Monks and USIU have 12 points each. University of Eldoret’s losing streak continued after succumbing to their fourth consecutive game going down 17-10. The Trojans dropped to 9th on the log which threatens their ambitions of playing in the knockout stage.
