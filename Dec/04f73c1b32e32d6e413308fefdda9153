The 2019 Tsavo Run took place over the weekend at the Tsavo National Park, with participants from all over the world. Event spokesperson Levi Tolbert described the 3rd edition of the Tsavo Run as the biggest so far, as plans were put in top gear to ensure participants had an amazing experience. The Tsavo Run is an Initiative to raise awareness of the environmental degradation of the Tsavo ecosystem, which covers a third of the county. The climax of the Tsavo Run was a gala night featuring awards presentations, entertainment and a networking session for the participants. The Tsavo ecosystem supports the life of millions of people in 12 counties and in the Kilimanjaro region in the neighbouring Tanzania.
