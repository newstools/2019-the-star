A 33-year-old man stabbed himself to death at Rodi Kopany market in Homa Bay Town constituency after he failed to kill his girlfriend. Tobias Otieno killed himself on Saturday by stabbing himself in the market after residents stopped him from knifing his estranged girlfriend. Otieno was a carpenter while his girlfriend sells chips in the market. The two parted ways after their relationship went sour. But the man realised his former girlfriend was eloping with another man. Witnesses said Otieno was enraged when he saw his ex-girlfriend with another man. Otieno went to the girl’s place of work, and quarrelled before stabbing her in the stomach. “The crowed of concerned residents saw him stab the woman. They separated them but Otieno turned and stabbed himself three times in the stomach,” a witness said. Some residents rushed the woman nearby hospital but later she was transferred Homa Bay referral hospital for treatment. According to Kalanya Kanyango chief Fredrick Onyango, Otieno killed himself after a group of people warned they would report him to police. “Out of guilt and fear, the man turned the knife on himself and stabbed his stomach repeatedly before he died,” Onyango said. He said they established that Otieno had planned to kill his girlfriend and later commit suicide. The administrator said a team of investigative officers found out that the deceased had bought and put in his workshop triatix, a poisonous pesticide used for agricultural purposes. “First he had a knife when he went to his girlfriend. Back at his workplace, he left some poison.  It could be that after killing his girlfriend he was planning on committing suicide,” Onyango said. The body of the deceased was taken to Homa Bay County referral hospital morgue.
