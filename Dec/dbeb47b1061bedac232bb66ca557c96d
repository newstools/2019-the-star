  Teso professionals have unveiled a five-year strategic plan that aims to empower youth and conserve the environment. The group will also lead in the empowerment and development of individual professionals as well as the larger Teso community which is classified as a minority group in Kenya. Teso Professionals Group patron Justus Otwani said members will be required to identify specific talents in youth and nurture them. Members who are engineers will be expected to guide youth who want to pursue engineering as a profession. They will also guide fresh engineering graduates by imparting knowledge on what is expected of them in the job market. The same will be replicated in other professions. “To achieve the objective of professional development, we will need to engage ourselves in the mentorship of the youth coming up the ranks,” Otwani said. “Those that have ambitions of being doctors can be mentored by the doctors in the TPG. Let us grow our membership so we can promote and mentor our youth for continuous growth.” The group met at Hotel Suddex in Amagoro on Saturday during it's Annual General Meeting. It was resolved that the membership should grow to at least 600 by 2024. The group's strategic plan includes activities that will fight environmental degradation. It identifies environmental degradation as an issue Kenya is grappling with and which should be addressed since it has direct negative effects on humanity.
