East African Breweries Limited has moved its corporate offices to a new space at the Garden City Business Park, adjacent to its old offices, and unveiled a fresh corporate logo. The company launched the new office and logo in an event presided over by Trade CS Peter Munya in Ruaraka, Nairobi. EABL’s new logo features the grains that are a key raw material in the brewing of beer. It also speaks to the company’s heritage in Kenya since 1922. The new logo was developed by Multimedia University student Elvis Otieno, 22.
