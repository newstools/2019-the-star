Former world 800m champion Eunice Sum is worried about the country's lack of formidable two-lap runners in the run-up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. The 2013 world 800m champion observed that, even though she is keen on the Tokyo Games, she is afraid that her exit from the scene could spell doom for an event that Kenya has had immense glory in the past. “I have represented Kenya for the last eight years but I have not seen serious competitors in our category, unlike in the men's where we have new runners season after season," said Sum. The 2014 Commonwealth Games champion said the problem lies at the transition point since many female athletes run well at the youthful stage but fail to successfully move up to senior ranks. “Many athletes may run well in junior races but fail to replicate the same in the senior ranks. It has been a challenge all through,” added Sum, a former African champion. She revealed that she has already started preparing for the 2020 Olympic Games, although her desire to start sometimes last year was delayed by injury. Sum, who has competed in two Olympic Games, has failed to win a medal, finishing 38th and 19th in the 2012 and 2016 respectively. “The injury forced me to miss many Diamond League series. It is early to talk about Tokyo but as an athlete, I really want to cut the ticket, just like any athlete across the world." "I am fit now for any race after recovering from an injury and I have begun going for long runs as part of my build-up,” said Sum.
