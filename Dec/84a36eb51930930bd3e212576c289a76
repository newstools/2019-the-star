Education CS George Magoha has urged parents and guardians to accept the results of their children. While releasing the 2019 KCSE exam results at Knec headquarters on Wednesday, the CS said the results should be celebrated as they are. "Everything that you do in life is important. Let nobody tell you that unless you get a job where you are putting on an Italian suit like me, then you are a failure. It is a person who thinks that you have failed who is a failure," Magoha said. He urged students to be proud of themselves. The CS also sent a stern warning to people who marry off girls at a tender age. "We are sending a stern warning to people who have the habit of marrying off small children; we shall come and take your wife from you and take her back to school," the CS said. A total of 125,746 candidates scored C+ and above in KCSE. A total of 699,745 candidates sat the exam. Tony Wabuko, from Kapsabet Boys High School, emerged the top student with a mean of 87.159 points. A total ofÂ 627 candidates scored grade A.
