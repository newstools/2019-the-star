Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has urged his supporters to remain calm as he deals with his situation following his arrest on Friday. Sonko is expected to be taken to court on Monday to face graft charges. Police have warned supporters planning to demonstrate that they will be dealt with accordingly. In a press statement issued on Sunday, Sonko said his arrest was politically schemed and asked supporters to remain calm. "I urge all my supporters t allow the law enforcement agencies to do their work and let the law take its course. The peace and stability of Nairobi is more important than anything else," Sonko said. His lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui said the governor was badly tortured and needs medication. Kinyanjui has also called for the arrest of a police officer captured in a video beating and mishandling the governor.  "It is embarrassing that this happened to our beloved governor who now urgently needs medication because of the inhumane way he was treated by rogue police officers in Voi," Kinyanjui said. Sonko was arrested in Voi and airlifted to Nairobi. The lawyer said police officers defied cries from the governor who despite traveling to Mombasa to attend an official function, also needed to get medication before noon as per his doctor's instructions. "Apart from injuring him mercilessly, the governor was also denied a chance to take his medication and the health situation is worsening," Kinyanjui said. Sonko was arrested on Friday in Voi on his way to Mombasa to officially close a workshop by Nairobi county staff. According to Kinyanjui, it was wrong for the police to treat him as someone running away yet he was in the company of bodyguards with his phone on. Police had said Sonko was arrested while on the run. "You can't be hiding or running away if you have government-designated bodyguards with you and your phone on.  The governor was on a normal daily mission," the lawyer said. edited by p. obuya
