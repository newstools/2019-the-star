Taita Taveta County is engaging stakeholders to formulate a Cultural Heritage Policy to preserve and market its cultural products and ensure continuity. Tourism executive Milkah Righa said the policy will offer various strategies through which various aspects of culture will be developed. She said the policy shall involve among other measures, installing council of elders, which will guide the community in various ways and recreating the traditional dresses. Speaking in Wray Museum, Voi Subcounty during the Sagalla Cultural Day, the executive said the county has a huge untapped tourism potential. "Once we have the Cultural Heritage Policy in place we will be able to safe guard our traditions and culture of Taita Taveta people and even diversify the culture of other communities living in this County," she observed. Once formulated, Righa said, the policy will also help market the county's tourists attraction sites. "We have magical sites that local and International tourists should enjoy visiting," she noted. The county boasts the expansive Tsavo National Park, wildlife sanctuaries, lodges and Vuria Hills, which is arguably the most preferred hiking and camping site in the Coastal region. In 2014, National Museums of Kenya gazetted 14 sites in Taita Taveta County as sites of historical interest and significance. They include Salaita Hill, Voi Commonwealth War Graves, Kenyatta Caves in Wundanyi and First Old District Commissioners’ House in Taveta. Others are Taveta ACK Holy Trinity Church Mahoo and Mahoo Pastor’s Residence.
