Fifa representatives Ms. Sarah Solémalé and Abdulah Marson Moustapha are in the country to assess Football Kenya Federation’s situation following the cancellation of the national body's elections. In a ruling by the Sports Dispute Tribunal read by John Ohaga early this month, the FKF County elections held on November 23, 2019, were nullified, with the subsequent national elections that were to be held on December 7, 2019 canceled. Fifa MA Governance Services Manager  Solémalé, accompanied by CAF chief of staff  Moustapha, had separate meetings with FKF President Nick Mwendwa, FKF’s Electoral Board, the Sports Registrar as well as Sports Cabinet Secretary Amb. Amina Mohamed. “Fifa and Caf needed to have a broad understanding of what is going on as well as what the next steps are,” said Ms. Solémalé. “Fifa are strict on term limits. The current mandate ends on February 10, and we will have to be considerate to ensure that elections are done within the first trimester of 2020,” she added. FKF last week issued a notice to all its members to hold engagement meetings aimed at deliberating on the 2019/2019 FKF electoral Code. Upon deliberation by the NEC on the decisions by the members, a Special General Meeting will be convened, which will serve to pass a vote on the Electoral Code. The NEC shall also propose an Electoral Board, which will be up for a vote on the same day. If passed, the Board will henceforth be mandated to conduct the repeat elections.
