 Former World Rally champion Stig Blomqvist snatched the lead from Australian Kris Rosenbeger after a dramatic Day 7 of the event which saw East African Classic Safari Rally cars pull into Voi Wildlife Lodge after a prolonged stay in Tanga and Arusha. Stig savoured his good run but only just—beating Kris by only 55 seconds. His spirited and assured match to the summit was boosted by the fastest time he set on the 53km CS16 Magozoni stage where he beat Baldev Chager by a mere 16 seconds while driving at an average speed of 107km/h The first stage of Day 7 (CS160 gave rally enthusiasts a sneak preview of what to expect in Kenya ahead of the finish at Sarova Whitesands. Onkar Rai of Kabras Team was at it again, this time winning the repeat run of the 91km Mkomazi stage which is the 17th of the event. Here, Onkar eclipsed Blomqvist by a 53 seconds margin. Chager was able to set 5th fastest on the stage. Chager, who is trying to make time after missing out on four stages, drove aggressively on CS18 (74.50Km), beating Aussie Rosenbeger by 30.2 seconds and setting the fastest stage time. For the last two days, Chager and Onkar have dictated the pace while trying to catch up with the rest of the field, a true indication of what to expect on the last six stages of the event over the next two days. It was another bad day in the office for Ian Duncan who was rebuilding his engine. Duncan, who is a multiple champion of the event, was dashing to Voi hoping to fix the car in order to restart today. The first car left Tanga yesterday morning and tackled the stretch from Magozoni to Korogwe laden with blind brows and concrete drifts. Thereafter, they went into Mukomanzi—same stage and into Buto–Kifaru. The 9th edition of the rally concludes on Friday at Sarova Whitesands.
