Harambee Stars sealed a spot in the semi-finals of the ongoing Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup yesterday as they came from behind to beat Sudan 2-1. Bandari forward Hassan Abdalla continued to justify his importance in the team as he netted in his second successive outing. His strike in the 65th minute pulled Kenya level after they had gone for the break trailing 1-0 to Mohammed Namir's goal for Sudan. Ulinzi Stars forward Oscar Wamalwa completed the turn-around with the winner in the 77th minute. Assistant coach Zedekiah Otieno was in charge of the match day squad after coach Francis Kimanzi was suspended for two matches over disciplinary issues. Zico made only one change to the team that overcame Tanzania in the opening match with Abdalla starting on the bench, replaced by AFC Leopards' Whyvonne Isuza. Stars went behind in the 30th minute when Namir escaped the attention of Johnstone Omurwa and Joash Onyango to beat veteran goalkeeper Samuel Odhiambo. It was an unfamiliar position Stars found themselves, having not gone behind in the previous tournament which they triumphed in on home soil in 2017. They, however, came back stronger in the second half following the introduction of Abdalla. The Bandari ace levelled matters with less than half an hour left to play,  setting the stage for Wamalwa to win the game for Kenya. Stars' next assignment will be against Zanzibar on Saturday. With one match left to play in the group stages,  Kimanzi's men lead Group 'B' with six points from two matches. Sudan have just one point. Hosts Uganda Cranes remains course to reclaim the regional title on home soil. Cranes booked their place in the last four after victories over Burundi and Somalia.
