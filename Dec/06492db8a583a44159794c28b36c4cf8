The festive season is here and many Kenyans and others will be travelling around the country. Since road transport is the most affordable and readily available,  it poses the highest risk exposure during this season. Public Service Vehicle operators are already salivating at the prospects of huge financial opportunities offered by Christmas travels. This is the time we expect the traffic police and the National Transport and Safety Authority to be extra vigilant to minimise death on our roads. Police should not let that overloaded bus proceed just for a Sh100 bribe. Private motorists must not be allowed to carry paying passengers as their insurance cover does not allow this. NTSA should carry out impromptu random inspections at bus termini to determine the roadworthiness of PSV vehicles. Passengers, on the other hand, must speak out when that bus driver is hurtling down the escarpment faster than a Ferrari. Courtesy and observance of traffic rules do not make you a lesser driver. We should not be reactive but instead be proactive to deal with unroadworthy vehicles, drunk driving, overloading and speeding. Let's all strive to reach our destinations in one piece and not add to the road carnage statistics.
