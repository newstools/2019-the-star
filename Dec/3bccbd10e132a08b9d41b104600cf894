Ivlyn Mutua, signed under Taurus music, has released an emotion-rousing song titled 'Missing You' dedicated to everyone who has lost their loved ones this festive season. Speaking to Word Is last week, she said as an artiste, her aim is to impact people with her music. "Music that people can directly relate both emotionally and through the struggles of life," she said. "For example, if someone lost a loved one, despite the grief, they should accept the situation and pull through with positivity." In the song, Mutua narrates how she and her friend had plans before his life was taken away by thugs at night. She says in the song, "We had plans to travel and explore the World, to be happy and have fun but the dream was cut short. We had plans to pray together. What is life without you this long holiday?" The vocalist said she's faced many challenges in life and wouldnâ€™t pull through without the help of family, who helped her stay positive through it all. "I was singing from the heart. I remember I was one of the first people to be informed after his demise," she said. "I didn' believe it. This song is for those families who have lost their loved ones or those are remembering their deceased who passed on during Christmas season." 'Missing You' is part of her recently released album, '12 Beats Of Christmas'.
