Three people believed to be in the business of selling stolen motor vehicles have been arrested by Flying Squad detectives acting on a tip-off from members of the public. The three were trailed to Meru where a Toyota Fielder, registration number KCH 301R was recovered. The suspects are Nicholas Opiyo (20), a resident of Kariobangi North, Kelvin Oduor Demba (28) from Baba Dogo and Patrick Mburugu (36) from Meru County but a resident of Ngara-Nairobi. In a similar operation in Nairobi County, DCI detectives intercepted two Toyota Hilux motor vehicles with double registration number KCE 600P and detained them pending further investigations. Last month DCI detectives recovered two vehicles believed to have been stolen in Langâ€™ata. The two, KCW 834A and KCS 757V had been stolen from Phenom Estate in Lang'ata and were recovered following a rigorous operation at Umoja and Soweto areas.
