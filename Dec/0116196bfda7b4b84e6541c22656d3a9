An MCA from Kiambu county has urged youths not to dig terraces on pathetic roads since the rains have not subsided. Lari Kirenga MCA Joseph Karichu said plans to rehabilitate were halted by the rains. He spoke in Nyambare village, where a group of young people dug terraces on a road and it became muddy and impassable. "We had embarked on these roads, but the politics and cases surrounding Governor Ferdinand Waititu came up. Nearly everything stopped," he said. "What is important now is to realise that roads are not constructed during the rainy season. No matter how much we push, we have to be patient until the rains subside," he said. However, youths have urged the county government to spread murram on the roads to make them passable. "As we wait for the government's plans, can they give us four lorries of quarry chips, and we shall spread them on the roads," youth leader David Karanja said. He said farmers are unable to transport animal feed to their farms and produce to the market.
