All hotels and lodges located in national parks and reserves are accessible by road, KWS has said. But Director general Ngugi Gecaga noted that Amboseli airstrip will still remain closed due to safety considerations. "The water levels at the airstrip have subsided and should the current weather conditions prevail, it is expected to be operational in the next few days," Gecaga said. Gecaga noted that all other airstrips and road which were affected by the heavy rains are fully operational and passable. The Kenya Wildlife Services hadÂ  issued a warning to visitors over the inaccessibility of some parts of the Amboseli National Park due to heavy rains. KWS stated that some national parks and roads have been affected by the heavy rains in the country hence inaccessible.
