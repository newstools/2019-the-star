The prosecution wants a police officer and two civilians facing robbery with violence charges to be remanded until the determination of their case for allegedly threatening to kill the complainant. The state prosecutor made an application before Kiambu senior principal magistrate Stellah Atambo to have Sh1 million imposed on Erick Mumo, a police officer, and Ezekiel Njoki and John Mutiso to be cancelled. The three are charged with violently robbing businessman Geoffrey Thuo of Sh1,300 cash at gunpoint after arresting and bundling him into the back seat of their saloon car on August 26 in Ruiru. Thuo is said to have been arrested by three armed men who bundled him into a car and demanded money, or they shoot him if he failed to comply. According to the prosecution, they ransacked his pockets and took Sh1,300 cash before they dumped him in Tatu City and sped off. The three were later arrested after an identification parade. The magistrate directed that the complainant makes a formal report to the police station and investigating officer to take up the matter.
