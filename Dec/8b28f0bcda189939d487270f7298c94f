Garissa Governor Ali Korane on Monday ordered demolition of all houses built illegally along ring road. Korane said the demolition will commence in 30 days after a yet-to-be formed committee vets genuine land owners. The committee, he said, will comprise county officials and security officers. He urged the county commissioner to provide enough security after the lapse of 30 days. Scores have been killed others seriously injured following recurrent feuds over lands. On Monday, five people were hospitalised after a fight broke out between two factions over ownership of property. Korane told the lands executive Mohamed Shale to ensure that the order is immediately restored. “If someone kills another he should personally be held liable, traditional way of solving issues should not be involved in matters of land, the government must arrest anyone killing over land ownership,” he said. Korane also appealed to the security agencies to smoke out illegal firearms that are held by civilians. “This county has no shortage of land that we can fight over. As a county we want to have proper documentation of the said land and then disburse to members of the public,” he added.
