Mombasa Sports Club will look to sign new players after sealing their return to the Kenya Hockey Union Premier League. MSC booked the second promotion slot ahead of Kenya College of Accountancy University, whom they tied on 43 points but the coastal side had on a superior goal difference after winning their matches against Impala and Kisumu Youngstars over the weekend. On Saturday, MSC fought from a goal down to win 2-1, thanks to goals from Victor Mwenda and Adaka Kilaini. Yesterday, they routed Youngstars 3-0 in the ultimate match to confirm their top-flight status. Mariano Emadau scored in the second quarter to hand his side the lead in the 16th minute. Four minutes later, captain Adaka Kilaini added a second before Marvin Barasa sealed the result with a third in the 48th minute. The coastal side was relegated in 2016 and coach Fredrick Arika said new additions are a priority if they have to stay in the top tier for the long term even though he admitted itÂ  won't be easy. He said: "We've all worked together for this achievement and I am excited to be back where we belong. It won't be smooth sailing in the Premier League but we are open to the possibility of beefing up our squad. Some of our players have graduated and I am not sure if they are going to be with us next season. We need squad depth and start early preparations for the new season" Brian Magombe, Derrick Omenda and Christopher Ochieng graduated last month from the Technical University of Mombasa and it remains unclear if they will continue playing for the club next season. MSC's 1-0 win over rivals KCAU on November 3, was perhaps their biggest of the season as it instilled belief in the side despite their 1-1 all draw Multimedia University before these matches. MSC have won 13 matches, drawn four and lost five times.
