 Traders in Mbita town are bitter that owners of freight containers have invaded their space. They say that some of their shops and business premises are blocked by the containers and want the Homa Bay county government to create space for every trader. The businesspeople, among them Hesborn Dondi and Grace Akinyi, complained that the containers were hindering the access to their businesses. Dondi said potential customers are unable to access their shops. “Some dishonest people have devised a method of placing containers in front of our shops. They frustrate our business because they block customers from reaching our shops,” Dondi said. The traders say their trading space had become filthy as people were now relieving themselves behind the containers. Dondi said five long freight containers had been illegally stationed in front of shops. “Some people pee and excrete near the containers. They have made the environment unsuitable for both traders and residents,” he said. The traders have written to the county executive for Trade, David Okeyo, to address the matter. They want the county government to intervene and ensure every trader is given adequate space from where to operate. Akinyi said they might stop paying taxes if the county government fails to act, adding that more than 10 women traders are adversely affected. “The money we pay as taxes comes from our business operations. Let this Homa Bay government address the matter or it forgets taxing us,” Akinyi said. On Sunday, the traders cautioned their colleagues operating from the containers not to ruin their market through dishonesty. “Our livelihoods depend on these businesses and we’ll not give room to people who want to spoil for us,” Dondi added.
