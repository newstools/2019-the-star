Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko was escaping arrest at a roadblock in Voi, EACC has confirmed. In a post on Twitter on Friday afternoon, EACC said they nabbed the governor who was attempting to escape from authorities. "EACC confirms that Sonko has been arrested while escaping arrest at a roadblock in Voi and is being transferred to Nairobi to face charges of corruption and economic crime," the anti-graft commission tweeted. Sonko was arrested by DCI detectives in Voi a few hours after the Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji ordered for his arrest. Sonko will be brought to Nairobi in a police chopper. He is expected to land at the Wilson Airport before being taken to the Integrity Centre for processing. Haji had earlier on Friday said he had sufficient evidence to warrant the prosecution of Sonko as well as senior City Hall officials following a review of the investigation file handed to the DPP by the EACC. Nairobi County Speaker Beatrice Elachi is likely to take over as Governor at City Hall following the arrest of Sonko. This move could also trigger a by-election in Nairobi as the Speaker can only act for a period of 60 days.
