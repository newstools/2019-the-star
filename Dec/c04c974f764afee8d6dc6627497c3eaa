A 33-year-old man allegedly caught sodomising a 10-year-old mentally challenged boy has denied any wrongdoing. Peter Kalia was charged in a Makadara court with defilement. The court heard that he committed the offence on December 10 on Mihang'o estate in Njiru, Nairobi. He was also charged with engaging in an indecent act with the boy. Sodomy is a felony under Section 162 of the Penal Code and is punishable by 14-year imprisonment if one is found guilty. On the other hand, indecent act with a minor is a felony under Section 165 of the Penal Code and attracts a five-year jail term. Defilement of children aged 11 and below attracts life imprisonment under the Sexual Offences Act. Kalia was accused of luring the boy to his friend’s house, where he was found by members of the public who suspected he was up to no good. He was assaulted by a mob after he was caught. The boy has been treated at a hospital and discharged. Kalia denied the charges before senior principal magistrate Angelo Githinji. He was granted Sh500,000 bond. The case will be heard from April 15 next year. (Edited by F'Orieny)
