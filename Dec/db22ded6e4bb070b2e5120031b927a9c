For the umpteenth time, motorists using the Mai Mahiu-Limuru road were stranded for hours following a major traffic jam. The jam that stretched for over 5km was caused by an accident involving two trailers and was worsened by overlapping motorists. At one time, the motorists had to alight from their vehicles and watch the mess before police managed to restore sanity. One of the affected passengers, Gerald Kuria, blamed impatient drivers for the problem, saying traffic jams along the road have become the norm. He said the only solution is widening the road. “Apart from the overlapping drivers there is need to think on how this road can be widened as the flow of traffic has also increased,” he said. Meanwhile, a group of former IDPs escaped death narrowly after a trailer lost control along the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road and rammed into their houses. During the Monday morning incident, one house at the Jikaze IDP camp was completely demolished but the occupants escaped unscathed. Drama unfolded when the IDPs stopped police from towing away the trailer from the scene until they were first compensated. They accused the driver of stage-managing the 5am accident so that he could claim that the cargo had been stolen by the victims of the post-election violence. One of the victims, Peter Thuo, said they were asleep when they were woken up by a loud crash caused by the trailer. Thuo said by the time the lorry hit their houses, the driver and the conductor had jumped out. “Half of the cargo in the trailer is missing and we suspect that the two stage-managed this accident so that we could be blamed for looting the cargo,” he said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru confirmed both incidents adding that the wreck of the trailer had been towed to Mai Mahiu police station. “In nearly all the traffic snarl-ups along the escapement, its impatient drivers who are responsible for the crisis,” he said.
