A man was charged yesterday with robbing a businessman of Sh1,000 at gunpoint and hitting him in the stomach. Edward Mwaura was charged before Makadara senior principal magistrate Angelo Githinji. He denied any wrongdoing. Mwaura is accused that on December 7 in Embakasi, Nairobi, he used a gun to hit Emmanuel Mogire's stomach and took away Sh1,000 from his pocket. Mogire was heading home from work. According to a police report filed in court, Mwaura was in the company of two other individuals when they waylaid Mogire. "They ordered me to stop and give them everything I had for my safety. I did so and after that Mwaura, whom I identified well, hit my stomach with a gun and stole my cash," he told the police. He was then ordered to leave the place without looking back. But Mogire called the police emergency number and some officers came to his help. "I called the police emergency number and the police came and I described the accused person. They later arrested him," he reported. The accused was taken to Embakasi police station and later arraigned.
