Kenya garnered 12 points as they bowed out of the Cape Town Sevens with a 17-5 defeat to South Africa yesterday. It was a tremendous improvement from Shujaa who last week won one match and lost three games in the season opener in Dubai. Kenya had stunned Samoa 24-19 in their opening match in the mother city before edging out Australia 12-7 and finishing their pool matches with a high scoring 24-24 draw against Ireland to finish second in the pool. Shujaa matched South Africa in a competitive contest, scoring the opening try through Alvin “Buffa” Otieno. However, two tries from South Africa's Ruhan Nel and playmaker Selvyn Davids saw the Blitzboke qualify for the semis in a hard fought contest. The two teams were tied at 5-5 at the interval. Head coach Paul Feeney was delighted with the performance of the team after an underwhelming start in Dubai last weekend. “ The boys have done the country proud . They showed character and heart in all the matches. We will build up momentum for the next two tournaments in New Zealand and Australia in January," he said. Feeney said the team has to improve its execution in attack as well as goal kicking and the kickoffs. “ We had a couple of opportunities against South Africa but our decision making in attack at times let us down. This is something we really have to improve on as well as our goal kicking and  kickoffs,” noted Feeney. The tactician said competition on the circuit has become stiff and the team has to adapt to the new format. "It's quite tough. There were no easy games. Last week, we saw Samoa and England play in the Main Cup semis and this week they are playing in the classification matches. It just proves its unpredictable," added Feeney. The team is expected to arrive today and have a day rest before resuming training after the Christmas and New Year holidays for the Hamilton and Sydney legs in January.
