One of the oldest and popular hotels in Kenya, the Sarova Stanley, recently held its annual Christmas Tree lighting ceremony. The theme of the Christmas Tree lighting is usually to symbolise hope and the good in the world. Every year, the pioneer hotel celebrates the value of life by lighting its Christmas tree at Thorn Tree Cafe. Hotel staff invited guests and members of the public joined in the ceremony as Sarova Stanley operations manager Tom Korir and National Museums of Kenya marketing officer Innocent Nyagah officially cut the tape to launch the Christmas Tree, which was laden with wrapped gifts and holiday seasons messages.
