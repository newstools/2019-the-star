Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says it is ‘not realistic’ to think of catching Liverpool in the Premier League title race, but says his side have a ‘duty to continue’. Saturday’s loss to Manchester United, coupled with Liverpool’s win at Bournemouth, leaves the champions 14 points behind Jurgen Klopp’s side. “It is not time to think about that,” Guardiola said. “We have to try to continue. There are many things to play for.” City would need to win all their remaining 22 games to reach the 98-point mark that secured the title last season. Even then, City - now three points behind second-placed Leicester, having played a game more — would require a significant dip in form from Klopp’s side, who have won 15 of their 16 games this term. “We think about what we have to do and the next game — it is not realistic to think about catching up,” Guardiola said. “Obviously it is so difficult because the opponents have had 16 games with 15 victories and they are on an incredible run and sometimes we have dropped points. But our duty, and what you have to do, is continue.”
