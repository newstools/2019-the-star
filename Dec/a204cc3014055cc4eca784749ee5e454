Equity Group CEO James Mwangi has been named among 50 most influential thought leaders in business by Bloomberg Businessweek. Mwangi was honored alongside environmental activist Greta Thunberg, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Comedian Jon Stewart, Singer Rihanna, CNN President and Warner Media Chairman Jeff Zucker, Founder of Fairfight Stacey Abrams and Gymnast Simone Biles, among others. The Bloomberg 50 highlights inspirational innovators, entrepreneurs, and leaders who are changing the game in quantifiable ways – from finance to fashion, entertainment to manufacturing, biotech, philanthropy and almost everything in between. Mwangi was lauded for his contribution in steering Equity Bank to have a presence in the greater Central and Southern Africa region. This through acquiring stakes in DRC, Mozambique and Zambia’s banking sectors through transactions with the Banque Commercial du Congo (BCDC) and Atlas Mara Ltd respectively. Equity also opened a representative office in Ethiopia, becoming one of the biggest banks with regard to customer penetration in Eastern and Central Africa. “I am honored to be part of this incredible group of people, who are changing the world in significant ways and driving their important messages home, with commitment and passion,” Mwangi said. The Bloomberg 50 honorees are celebrated in a special issue of Bloomberg Businessweek across all platforms showcasing leaders in business who merit recognition and applause for their achievements in the business scene.
