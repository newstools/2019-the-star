Two tropical storms are expected in East Africa late on Thursday and Friday, according to the latest weather reports. Somaliaâ€™s semi-autonomous region of Puntland is bracing for what authorities have described as a category two storm. Weather experts say at least nine countries in the East African region are experiencing heavier than usual rains as a result. A weather phenomenon on the Indian Ocean is causing the heavy rains across the region with rivers swollen and some areas experiencing floods and others landslides. At least 130 people have died in Kenya and Uganda. The unusual weather pattern is expected to climax before the end of this week, with a tropical storm making landfall in northern Somalia. Much of Somalia is usually dry but, since September, parts of the country have received more than double the normal amount of rainfall. Authorities there have advised coastal residents to avoid low lying areas. The higher than usual rains are also falling over Southern Ethiopia, Tanzania, Djibouti, Rwanda, Burundi and much of South Sudan. The intensity of the rain is expected to subside after it makes landfall.
