Glenmorangie was thrilled to host global brand ambassador Hamish Torrie during his second visit to Kenya on December 13. Torrie and Glenmorangie East African brand ambassador Antoine Bbayaga met top tier CEOs to celebrate the creation of one of their groundbreaking top-of-the-range whiskies—The Signet—in Kenya at an exclusive event at the Blue Door, Mr Yao, Westlands. The pioneering single malt whisky was launched in 2006 and was the first to use high roast ‘chocolate malt’ barley in its production filling the air at the distillery with a beguiling aroma of Aruba- rich coffee and producing distinctive mocha flavours.
