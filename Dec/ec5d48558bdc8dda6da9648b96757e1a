East African Breweries Limited (EABL) has moved its corporate offices to new space at the Garden City Business Park, adjacent to its old offices, and unveiled a fresh corporate logo. The brewer has taken four floors of the Grade A office complex. Group CEO Andrew Cowan has described the migration to the new building as a significant step for the company as it nears its centenary celebrations in 2022. “Going into our second century you can expect us to double down on our commitment to East Africa,” said Mr Cowan. He said the company will increase its ability to make drinks using locally-sourced raw materials, invest in local capacity to ensure local jobs, continue on its sustainability initiatives, as well as its tradition of sending its Kenyan staff abroad to build enriching careers and experiences for themselves and their families. “This month alone, we are commissioning more brewing vessels into the Kisumu brewery. This alone underwrites further commitment to the 17,000 farmers supplying us with sorghum in the region. More brewing vessels making more beer needs more sorghum,” said Mr Cowan. Trade, Industry and Cooperatives CS Peter Munya said the government will continue to support industries and create the right environment for both home-grown companies and foreign investors to thrive. “The Trade, Industry and Cooperatives ministry is working to reduce the multiplicity of laws, regulations and levies across the counties that have been cited as a hindrance to businesses. As Kenya improves in the Ease of Doing Business Index, we also appreciate the need to improve the country’s competitiveness,” said Munya. EABL’s new logo features the grains that are a key raw material in the brewing of beer. It also speaks to the company’s heritage in Kenya since 1922.
