Mwananchi Credit has opened its sixth branch in Mombasa. The micro-finance company target to be a top tier micro lender. The newest office is at the ground floor of Jubilee Arcade building along Moi Avenue. Executive director Dennis Mombo on Monday said the company intends to open six new offices in various towns across the country in the next three months. “It has been an issue of consideration in the past few months, that an important commercial centre like Mombasa warrants a completely different branch instead of just one solitary department in the Head Office,” Mombo said. He added, “We know the economy has not been well but the best time to invest money into opening new branches is now. Our goal is to be the top tier micro lender”. Mombo said with such thought in mind, the company hopes the Mombasa office will be a success as they expect all of their new employees as well as those they will transfer to work hard and bring up the office to the levels of excellence in the city. Mwananchi Credit Limited is a local company that has for the past six years been known for its offering loan products ranging from Logbook loans, title deed loans, civil servant loans and many more.
