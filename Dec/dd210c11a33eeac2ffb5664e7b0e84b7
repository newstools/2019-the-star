In a rare case of the proverbial chicken coming home to roost, Mandera county became the first-ever county in Kenya to suffer loss of population from the previous census 10 years ago in 2009. The 2019 Census showed Mandera had 867,457 people down from 1,025,756 in 2009, a reduction of 158,299. It dropped from the tenth most populous county to 27th, the highest drop in ranking among the 47 counties. This was a 15.43 per cent reduction. Mandera was among four counties where the state disputed results of the August 2009 census and wanted it repeated. This was due to unusually high growth rate in the census results from eight districts (subcounties) in Mandera, Wajir, Garissa and Turkana, leading to suspicions they were manipulated. However, an attempt to nullify the results and hold a repeat census in the eight districts was blocked by the courts. A case in point is the unusual case of Mandera South constituency that was the most populous in Kenya (247,619) after 2009 census but had the lowest number of registered voters in the 2013 elections at 10,574 (4.27 per cent of the population). The Kenya Election Database software, Kenya's only digital source of National election results (1969-2017) had projected that Kenya will have 49,652,585 people as of August 2019. Other projections were 52.7 million from the United Nations and 49,3 million from the International Monetary Fund. The population was 38.6 million in the August 2009 census and rose to 47.6 in the August 2019 census, a growth of 23.2 per cent. This shows Kenya’s annual growth rate was an average of 2.3 per cent, the lowest in several decades and was unexpected going by the population project made by several organisations, including the KNBS itself. This means Kenya’s birth rate has been falling during the last 10 years, the reason for which is now subject to debate by demographic experts. While some counties in Kenya recorded high growth rates eg. Isiolo (87.03%), Kajiado (62.64%) and Kiambu (48.14%), others recorded surprisingly low growth rates eg. Mandera (-15.83%), Nyamira (1.22%) and Vihiga (6.38%). Raise in growth rate can be due to local migration, for instance, people moving from Nairobi to live in “dormitory” towns in Kajiado county (Ongata Rongai, Kiserian, Ngong, Kitengela) or Kiambu (Kiambu, Kikuyu, Limuru, Ruiru, Rwaka, along the Thika Superhighway, Juja). Low growth rate can be attributed partly to migration to other areas due to lack of land (Vihiga and Nyamira) or alleged manipulation of 2009 census data as in Mandera. The projection made using the Kenya Election Database software and posted on the Kenya Election Database’s Facebook page on September 9 had projected Kenya will have 49.7 million people when the 2019 census is released, but the figure was 47.6 million, missing the target by 2.1million Some political leaders have complained that their people were “undercounted”, especially in Northeastern and Western region. They have vowed to sue to have the census results annulled and repeated. But a recent amendment to the Statistics Act gave Treasury Cabinet Secretary power to amend the census results where it deviates from the norm, hence making it impossible for the courts to interfere. Section 23 of the Statistics Act was amended as follows: - (3) Upon request by the Board, the Cabinet Secretary may with the approval of the Cabinet, cause any official statistical data collected, analyzed and disseminated by the Bureau to be cancelled, revised or adjusted after ascertaining that the data is not accurate. (4) The Cabinet Secretary shall within fourteen days of approval by the Cabinet, publish the official data that has been cancelled, revised or adjusted under sub-section (3), in the Gazette.
