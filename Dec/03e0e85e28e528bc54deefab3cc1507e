Focus has shifted to 2020 Olympic Games for former world cross country champion Agnes Tirop and Africa Junior cross country champion Nicholas Kipkorir Kimeli, who wound up their season with victory at the Ziwa Farmers 10km Road Race on Saturday. After winning a 10,000m bronze medal at the 2019 World Championships in Doha,  Tirop said she is happy with how the seasoned turned out but hopes to upgrade her third place in Doha at the Tokyo Games. She said she will retreat for serious training to help her capture the ticket to represent the country at the Olympics. “It has been my dream to compete at the Olympics and come next year, I want to do my best,” said the 2015 world cross country champion. The Iten-based runner, who battled a knee injury that kept her out of competition for three years, won a hat-trick at the Ziwa Farmers race, ran along Eldoret-Cherangany Road. She beat Sheila Chelangat, Brilliant Jepkorir, reigning Frankfurt Marathon champion Valary Aiyabei and former Africa 2,000m steeplechase champion Daisy Jepkemei. Tirop cut the tape in 31:33.9 ahead of Chelangat (31:37.2) while Jepkorir completed the podium in 31:46.7 in a hotly contested women's race. Kimeli, a 5,000m finalists at the 2019 World Championships, said he is training to deliver a 5,000m championship gold medal, which the country last won through Benjamin Limo at the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki, Finland. “It is not easy to win the 5,000m title but I will try my best at the Olympic Games," said Kimeli. He, however, remained cognisant of the fact that he will have to make the team through the gruelling Kenyan trials. He cut the tape in 28:10.5 for a brace, beating former Discovery Cross country champion Josphat Kipchirchir (28:23.4) with upstarts Shadrack Kipngetich (28:35.2) and Weldon Kipkurui (28:39.9) third and fourth respectively.
