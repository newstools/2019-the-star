Diamond Platnumz has said he will marry Kenyan singer and model Tanasha Donna in 2020. “We should pray that next year to be my time to get married, Inshallah. All my siblings have already married and I don’t have a reason to keep on postponing,” he told Wasafi media at the weekend. “I have all the reasons to marry. I have a beautiful wife who has given me a good child. I eat and I have good friends.” The couple postponed their wedding date from February 14, 2019, to accommodate family members. ‘The wedding was supposed to be on February the 14th but I told Diamond that I can’t do it until my mom is here, and she can’t leave work at the moment,” Tanasha said The singer gave birth to Diamond’s fourth child, Naseeb Jnr, in October. Diamond had also promised to marry Zari Hassan when he was dating her and said theirs would be the best wedding in East Africa. But on Valentine’s Day 2018, Zari dumped the singer in a long post that was accompanied by a black rose, symbolising dead love.
