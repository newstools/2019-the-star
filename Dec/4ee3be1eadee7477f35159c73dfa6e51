Police in Nyeri have issued a warrant of arrest against Nyeri county deputy speaker Samuel Kariuki after he was caught on video assaulting a youth over the weekend. The incident happened on Sunday as Tangatanga and Kieleweke groups from the Jubilee party clashed as Deputy President William Ruto visited the area. Trouble started after a group of youths believed to be supporters of Tangatanga grabbed T-shirts from those believed to be from the Kieleweke faction of Jubilee. The T-shirts had the inscription 'Uhuru's Bedroom' at the back and 'No 2022 Politics' at the front. The deputy speaker had earlier been arrested but was released under unclear circumstances. In the video, Kariuki was seen assaulting one of the youths together with other men. They are said to have assaulted other people before handing them over to the police officers who were in a police vehicle. Police had a hard time ejecting the youths from the scene after they vowed not to allow Kieleweke supporters into the venue of the meeting. The police managed to restore order by the time Ruto arrived. The DP urged the youths not to be misused by politicians.
