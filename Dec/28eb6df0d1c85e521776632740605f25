Drama ensued at the Voi airstrip after Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko declined to board a police chopper. The chopper had come to airlift the governor to Nairobi after DPP Noordin Haji ordered for his arrest. Haji had earlier on Friday said he had sufficient evidence to warrant the prosecution of Sonko as well as senior City Hall officials over irregular payments amounting to Sh357 million. In a video taken during the arrest, Sonko is seen resisting arrest as officers struggle to take him into the chopper. “Nobody shall intimidate me, all these claims are aimed at bringing me down but they won’t succeed,” defiant Sonko told the police officers. At one point, officers are seen engaging in blows as they tried to get Sonko to board the police chopper. The officers fought as other officers bundled Sonko up to the chopper. He was later handcuffed and escorted into the chopper as travellers watched. A contingent of police who aided in the multi-agency operation harassed and barred journalists from covering the dramatic event. “The Governor is very violent, he has seriously beaten one of us who were escorting him to the chopper. It was a very complicated operation but we have successfully completed it,” a junior officer who is not authorised to address press said. Earlier the EACC said Sonko was escaping arrest at a roadblock in Voi. In a post on Twitter on Friday afternoon, EACC said they nabbed the governor who was attempting to escape from authorities. Sonko will be brought to Nairobi in a police chopper. He is expected to land at the Wilson Airport before being taken to the Integrity Centre for processing.
