The guidelines issued by the Ministry of Education that expectant children be allowed to proceed to Form 1 is not right, neither for themselves, the other students and society at large. The girls will be too uncomfortable, physically and socially, to concentrate on studies, especially following stigma by the others. As much as it will help them continue with their studies, it will raise other issues they may not be able to deal with which may put at risk their health and that of their unborn babiesâ€™. They should be allowed to deliver, given a year then be admitted to school.  Kisii
