Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua does not deserve anybody's attention, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has said. Murkomen was responding to Mutua's claims that he threatenedÂ his life during a function at State House. Addressing journalists on Monday, Mutua said National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale and Murkomen had threatened him for 'fighting' Deputy President William Ruto politically. "Nilishambuliwa na mweshimiwa Duale na Murkomen kwa kuniambia ya kwamba ninawashambulia. Nilipowauliza eti ninawashambulia vipi wakasema eti nimekuwa nikimshambulia Ruto," Mutua said. But in a quick rejoinder, Murkomen said Mutua is writing another episode of his 'cobra squad series'. "Having failed spectacularly as a leader he turned himself into a Joseph Goebbels of his county government," Murkomen said. He added "He is of no consequence to anyone to deserve any attention let alone threats. Let's just watch the cinematic.vipindiree." The governor who also accused Ruto of threatening him added that his threats have been linked to his ambitions to vie for the presidency during the 2022 general elections. Mutua is one of the politicians who have expressed the ambition to challenge Ruto for the State House race in 2022.
