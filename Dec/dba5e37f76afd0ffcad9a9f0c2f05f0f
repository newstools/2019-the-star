Kenyatta and Strathmore Universities defended their volleyball (women and men) titles as curtains came down on the biennial Kenya Universities Sports Association (KUSA) championships at Moi University Annex Campus in Eldoret. Strathmore men, under Kenya Prison women’s head coach Josp Barasa, defeated KU 3-1 to defend the title. The champions started well, winning the opening set at 25-22 but KU’s resilience saw them sneak back into the games to win the second set 20-25. However, Barasa changed tactic by introducing new players to seal the last two sets in 26-26 and 25-13. “We really worked hard for this title. Winning and defending it was our main target and I am happy we won it,” said Barasa. In the women’s category, KU defeated Strathmore 25-20, 29-27, 19-25 and 18-16.  “That was a tough match. KU gave it their best shot and retained the title. It is not easy to overthrow the champions,” added Barasa. In football, Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST) defeated KU 3-0 in women’s category.  Christable Keya (34th minute), Mirriam Chelagat (42nd) and Ruth Chebungei (77th minute) were on target for the winners. In the men’s category, Strathmore University beat KU 5-4 on post match penalties after a barren draw regulation time to settle for the men’s crown. Eugene Owino, Felix Anani, Henry Wafula, Trevor Odhiambo and Barack Dago converted for Strathmore while Mark Okoth, Brian Okeyo, Steve Obukuyi and Bill Clinton score for KU.
