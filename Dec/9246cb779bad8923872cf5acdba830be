Counties will improve the livelihoods of residents if strategic measures are adopted to achieve development,  Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has said. Ngilu said development realised in counties illustrate the essence of devolution as the engine to attain growth for Kenya. “Devolution has opened up opportunities even in rural areas. We must focus on supporting programmes that directly transform the lives of our people,” she said. The governor spoke when she hosted Nakuru MCAs who had paid a courtesy call on her on their second day of a benchmarking tour of Kitui. She said county governments must exploit unchartered areas to raise revenue and concentrate on projects that positively impact the lives of the people. Ngilu cited capacity building, youth and women empowerment, focus on agriculture, improved healthcare, food production and water provision as key areas that would transform counties for posterity. Nakuru Majority whip Alice Kering said Kitui was an example of counties where devolution had realised significant progress despite a myriad of challenges. Nakuru Township MCA Peter Nyaguthi said the visit to Kitui offered great insights into what devolution meant for mwananchi. Minority Whip Zaituna Ibrahim lauded Kitui's progress in youth training and empowerment. “Kitui’s focus on growing manufacturing, supporting bee keeping and creating employment for youths is inspiring. We are very pleased to learn this is possible,” she said. Kitui deputy Majority leader Colleta Koli said the assembly supports the executive to deliver to the people by approving budgets and legislation to ensure residents reap the fruits of devolution. "We had wrangles between the assembly and the executive before but we now appreciate what the governor is doing. We now understand the government's agenda,” she said.
