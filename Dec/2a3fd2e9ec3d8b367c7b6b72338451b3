Petro oil company Kenya has dismissed claims that it is mistreating its employees by providing a poor working environment. The management claimed that the allegations, levelled by the staff, were not true, saying they have not denied anyone from joining a union. Caroline Mulili, the Petro Oil Human Resource Manager, said the company has also not denied any staff off-duty as alleged by staff from their Malindi station. Speaking in Malindi, she said the law provides that after an employee works for six consecutive days, they need to rest on the seventh day. ''This can be confirmed by the master roles, which are signed by the station manager in each and every station of ours countrywide in the network,'' she said. Mulili said records show that all employees take their off duty on their seventh day, adding that she had not heard any complaints that there was a staff who had did not get their day off. She said some of the employees who were complaining had pending disciplinary cases that's why they were protesting.
