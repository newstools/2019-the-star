Some Ukambani politicians want Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to join Deputy President William Ruto in campaigning for president. The leaders want Kalonzo and Ruto to form a new political party, arguing that ODM leader Raila Odinga has replaced Kalonzo with other three governors from Ukambani. Speaking during a funds drive at Holy Spirit Catholic church In Kangundo on Saturday, the leaders advised Kalonzo to disengage Wiper from ODM. said Raila has been playing tricks on Kalonzo. Led by Kangundo MP Fabian Kyule Muli, they urged Kalonzo to take a firm political stand and fight for Ukambani residents. Kyule accused Raila of disrespecting the Kamba community during the Kibra by-election rally "after they had shown him unconditional and continuous support in the previous general elections". Machakos Town MP Victor Munyaka and Kitui East MP Nimrod Mbai backed his remarks. Ruto also supported the idea and urged Kambas to support him in 2022. He said Kenya needs leaders who will help it grow through developments and not through empty promises. "This country has people with no plans of developments or for the future. They only have theories which have no value to the common mwananchi," Ruto said. He added that Raila and other leaders were using the BBI report to cause divisions among Kenyans. The development comes a few weeks after Wiper leaders in Machakos criticised ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna for saying that affiliate parties of the Nasa coalition are leeches and parasites to ODM. The leaders want ODM to give Wiper its rightful share of the money it received from the Registrar of Political Parties. Edited by R.Wamochie
