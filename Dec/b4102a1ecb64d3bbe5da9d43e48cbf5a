Sweden-based midfielder Antony Wambani is hoping to play a crucial role in Harambee Stars bid to defend their Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup crown. The Vasalunds'midfielder was the only European-based player named in the 20- man squad by coach Francis Kimanzi. The former Bandari playmaker started the first match against Tanzania and was impressive as Kenya held on for a 1-0 win. He missed the subsequent come from behind victory over Sudan as Stars sealed a place in the last four of the regional tourney. “I started the tournament well when we won the first game against Tanzania. I later got ill because of the weather change and I am still recuperating. Hopefully, I will get better and try to help the team if given another chance,” remarked Wambani. The midfielder is a late bloomer in the national set-up having never won a cap previously. His call up came as a surprise to him as it was to football followers across the country. Wambani revealed that he is relishing every opportunity to know his compatriots in Kampala with hopes of helping the team retain the crown they have won twice in the last six years (2013-2017). “It's been a good experience with the camp in Nairobi and here in Uganda with my teammates,” he stated. “Of course, everyone is focused. No one knows what will happen tomorrow because this is football but we are ready to defend our title,” he finished. Stars are set to face Zanzibar in the final match of Group 'B' knowing that their place in the last four is already assured. Zedekiah 'Zico' Otieno will be in charge of the team yet again as Kimanzi concludes his two-match touchline ban. Zico is likely to make changes to the starting eleven tomorrow to give the fringe players an opportunity to impress ahead of the semi-finals slated for next week. Bandari's Hassan Abdalla (2) and Ulinzi Stars striker (1) have accounted for the three goals Kenya have scored so far. Stars beat Tanzania 1-0 following it up with a 2-1 win over Sudan.
