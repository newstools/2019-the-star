National champions Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) are keen to stretch the playoff semi-finals series to five games. Coach Sammy Kiki said: “I am happy we are going to Nairobi when series are level. We will approach every game seriously, our mission is to stretch the series to game five.” KPA were hammered in Game One of the best of five series at their Makande Welfare Hall back yard and many thought it might be over. But in the pivotal Game Two, the porters responded with a superb display hammering the soldiers 92-69 to level the series 1-1 going into Game Three and Four in the city. “We started Game One well but lost focus. We came back very strong in Game Two, adjusted our defence and it worked,” Kiki said. “We stopped their strong players from damaging us, and the execution was perfect.” KPA sailed off to a 25-15 first quarter lead before Ulinzi stormed back for a 28-17 edge. A solid 31-13 burst in the third gave them a healthy advantage. They iced it with a 19-13 in the last. Atiel Okal coasted for 26 points and Job Byron managed 21 for the home team. Ulinzi had Eric Mutoro to thank for dropping 29 while Victor Bosire made 10. KPA crushed 82-69 to Ulinzi Warriors in Game One. Okal and Martin Kitongo had 12 points each. Bosire hit 21 and Mutoro shot 20. At Nyayo Stadium gymnasium, Kenyatta University Pirates stayed alive with a close 53-51 win over University of Nairobi Terrorists. UoN leads 2-1. Thunder also even the series 1-1 after they turned the tables Emyba winning Game Two 80-71. Women's champions Equity Bank will battle KPA in the finals after they crushed University of Nairobi and Storms respectively. In the lower division matches, Costal Kings beat Riara 73-63.
