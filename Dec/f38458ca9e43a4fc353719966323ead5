Gospel artiste-cum-pastor Size 8 has shown off her newborn child, Muraya Junior, for the first time. The 'Mateke' hitmaker, who had a near-death experience during pregnancy, has been keeping a low profile ever since she welcomed her bundle of joy. She has shared a photo with her child, thanking God for the special blessing. "See God!!!!! Father Lord, I take this opportunity to publicly praise you for the victory I've seen in my life!!! You have given me life and blessed me with another child I give you glory!" she wrote. "In my weakness and imperfections, you have shown me with your MERCY and clothed me with your GRACE!! This is all about you JEHOVAH! Never about me!!!" Size 8 and her husband DJ Mo now have two children together. DJ Mo, while introducing his son, said, "You will be the greatest, highly favoured, respected and you will be more than a conqueror."
