Before the year ends, Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga are at war yet again. On Friday night, Ruto has hit out at Raila for asking Kenyans to be patient as work on the BBI report continues. In a an open attack, Ruto, said Kenya is the collective business of all Kenyans and not just Raila's. "Boss, the last time I checked Kenya was the collective business of the 47 million of us. When did it become yours, for the rest of us to be patient with you, as you decide what is good for us!" he said in a tweet. He added; "Yaani sasa imefika hapo? Please a little decency & respect is not much to ask of you ndugu." Ruto was responding to Raila who on Friday, while speaking in Nyamira, asked for calm as the implementation of the BBI report is unveiled. Raila said Kenyans should be patient with BBI, which he said would transform the country. “We want to thank Kenyans for standing with us against all odds. It will take time for us to get where we want to be, but we are on track,” said Raila. Fresh battle lines have been drawn between the the two leaders over the constitutional amendment route for the BBI proposals. The leaders have sharply differed on whether to use a parliamentary initiate or a referendum to anchor selected Building Bridges Initiative recommendations in the Constitution. Raila Odinga and his allies are pushing for a public vote on the BBI proposals. This has opened a fresh battlefront with Ruto's troops opposed to a referendum.
