Dubai’s Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing marked the countdown to the landmark 25th edition of the Dubai Shopping Festival (DSF) with a three-city media roadshow across Africa. A diverse calendar of DSF events was revealed to African audiences in Kenya at Sankara Hotel Nairobi on Saturday. Already famous for its grand raffles and giveaways, the silver jubilee edition promises to have “bigger everything than the past 24 years”. Commenting on the events, Salim Dahman, head of campaigns Africa at Dubai Tourism, said, “Dubai continues to rank among the most popular destinations for audiences from across Africa, particularly as we observe retail emerging as a key component of their travel experiences, buoyed by flagship events such as the Dubai Shopping Festival.”
