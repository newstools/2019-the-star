There was scare on Tuesday after reports of a  missing plane. Sources told the Star that the plane which left Rusinga Island  went missing around Narok area. "Nobody knows where it is. The plane registration 5Y OME disappeared on the Radar around Narok," he said. But in a statement, KCAA director general Gilbert Kibe said they were conducting a drill to see how the government was prepared. "The exercise will help us gauge the preparedness of the agencies that are part of the search and rescue system in responding to an aviation incident," he said. Kibe said they had been planning the exercise for over a year. "The planning process involved communication and desktop exercises culminating in the full scale drill with independent evaluators on board," he said. Search and rescue entails a missing or lost aircraft and provision of assistance to persons who are in distress or immediate danger after an air crash. Plane accidents occur quite regularly but rarely do Kenyans get to hear about them. An investigation by the Star has unearthed details revealing a sector that keeps crucial information top secret to keep spotless the image of Kenya's civil aviation, maintain revenue flow and wash away any insurance queries. National Assembly Committee on Transport member Ayub Savula (Lugari MP) told the Star that 27 air accidents have taken place since January 2018.
