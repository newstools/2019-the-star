The National Environment Management Authority has threatened to close down Maseno University over raw sewage disposal concerns. Nema acting director-general Mamo B Mamo said on Monday nothing had been done to fix the sewage disposal system despite several orders issued to them. He said the university lacked a sewerage treatment plant and was discharging raw waste into Lake Victoria. The institution has seven days to stop the direct discharge of raw sewage and establish a treatment plant, failing which it will be closed. “The institution must comply with the water quality regulations of 2016. We have issued them with an ultimatum and failure to comply we shall close it,” Mamo said. “It is unfortunate for the university which is a centre of excellence on environmental conservation to fail to comply with the regulations.” Maseno University deputy vice chancellor Catherine Wahome said waste disposal at the university has been a challenge because of the huge student population. She said the sewer line the institution is using was installed in 1991 to cater for 1,500 students, but the number has since grown to 15,000. Wahome said the university is at different stages of procurement to establish a sewerage treatment plant. “The pollution pressure in this area with the Maseno gazetted as a township is posing a challenge to the university since some people have encroached on the university’s sewer line,” she added.
