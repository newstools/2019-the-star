AFC Leopards will not hire a new coach to succeed Andre Mbungo but will instead look up to the duo of Anthony Kimani and Tom Juma until the end of the season. Mbungo resigned on December 13 citing lack of pay but extended his services with the club until the final fixture of the year, in which they clawed Mathare United 3-0 at the Mumias Sports Complex. The Rwandese coach was due to jet out of the country yesterday evening but opened up of his desire to take another coaching job in the country in the future should an offer come his way. After tendering his resignation letter, Mbungo was reported to be a sure bet for the coaching job at Rwandese giants Rayon Sports but he trashed the links saying that he was heading for holiday at home. "I am proud of the job I did at Leopards and I wish them the best of luck. Should I get another opportunity in the country I will come back. There were reports that I threw in the towel to coach Rayon but that's not the case. I am want to spend time with my family before resuming the touchline duties elsewhere," said Mbungo. Leopards chairman Dan Shikanda confirmed that the club will be steered by the former Kenyan internationals until the end of the season. Kimani served as Mbungo's assistant while Juma is the team manager. "We received his resignation letter earlier in the month and we are glad he overstayed. We have handed the mandate to the duo of Juma and Kimani until the end of the season. We do not want to change the philosophy midway," said Shikanda. Meanwhile, Juma said they will build on the success they had achieved under Mbungo and promised to ring just a few changes to the playing unit. "We are equal to the challenge. We will build on what we had achieved with him. We can not change anything at the moment as the team had adapted to his ways of playing. We will make a few adjustments in the transfer season to strengthen a few areas he had identified," said Juma.
