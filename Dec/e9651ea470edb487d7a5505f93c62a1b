Kenya’s Fantalis Lucy Nduta’s unbeaten run will come under threat today when she faces South African Kajol Naidoo in the girls' Under- 8 competition at the ongoing African Youth Chess Championships in Windhoek, Namibia. Both Nduta and Naidoo have not lost a match, but the former boasts of 100 per cent win for four points, while the South African garnered three victories and a draw for 3.5. The two lead the field of 20 in the first and second places respectively. South African Kaylee Budhram was Nduta’s latest victim in round four, where the Kenyan condemned her opponent to stagnate at 2.5 points for the sixth place. Nduta had in the earlier rounds defeated Zimbabwean duo of Nadia Mpetura and Grace Zharehwa, and Egyptian Ashraf Hafza. Chess Kenya (CK) secretary general John Mukabi said the chess enthiasts are positive that she will at least banner the country’s flag on the podium at the showpiece.  CK’s Duke Michieka is the chief arbiter. “The first time a Kenyan has led a category at the Youth Championship ever and the girl is very promising. We at CK are very optimistic that if Nduta continues with the same momentum, she will win gold medal or a silver at the least,” intimated Mukabi. To settle in the second position, Naidoo outwitted Kenyan Hope Amana Kairo, Zimbabwean Lynne Chidanhire and Nigerian Deborah Quickpen. She shared spoils with Budhram to bag 3.5 points. Amana is 19th on the log with half a point. Viraj Bhaveshu is the top Kenyan player in the U-14 Open category in position seven with 2.5 (1505) points after four rounds. He is scheduled to face ninth-placed compatriot Candidate Master Aguda Lwanga who also has 2.5 (1139). Other Kenyans in this category are Simon Njoroge and Imani Amor Oriyo who lie in positions 19 and 23. Kenyans Tracy Mboya (1.5 points), Keziah Amani (1) and Brenda Cherotich (1) have placed 10th, 12th and 13th respectively in the girls U-16 category.
