The best performing pupil during this year's KCPE exam - Andy Michael Munyiri - will join Alliance High School. He scored 440 marks. Top performing female students, June Jeptoo and Onyango Flavian, who tied with 439 marks — landed slots at Pangani Girls and Alliance Girls. A total of 1,083,456 candidates sat 2019 KCPE, out of which 1,075,201 have been placed in secondary schools. Details of the placement exercise were made public on Monday by Education CS George Magoha in Nairobi. A total of 184,816 others will join extra county schools, another 188,454  will join county schools, while the bulk of the admission will be in the sub-county schools (day schools) that will admit 669,1145 students. "Some 777 special needs education candidates have been placed in their choice in regular schools. In total, 1,246 have been placed in various categories of schools," Magoha said. At least 30,000 students will proceed to secondary schools they had not picked. Magoha says this is due to limited spaces in the schools they had picked. "This year, we discovered that candidates considered capable of scoring top marks in the KCPE have a tendency to select just a few schools. Unfortunately, the top schools that are the envy of these candidates have no capacity to admit all of them," Magoha said. Students from marginalised areas will be the biggest beneficiaries of those securing national school places but with less than 400 marks. The CS further warned principals from turning away students who might have trouble in raising the required fees. The CS further revealed that the new students are set to start reporting to respective schools from January the 13, while the last date will be on January 17.
