Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang'ula has asked the government to translate the BBI report into Swahili and other local languages. The Bungoma senator said that even after the release of the report, Kenyans, especially those in rural areas, are yet to get copies. The BBI report was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta at the Bomas of Kenya, in Nairobi on November 27. "I urge everyone to read the report. I was disappointed recently when I heard a young man say if Baba reads, he will not read and will follow what Baba says. Let each of us read and understand the document," Wetang'ula said in Kitale. The senator also took issue with a recent statement by Education CS George Magoha that school principals should be in charge of setting school fees. He said the move is uncalled-for since most principals may exaggerate fee structures. "The education of our children should not be destroyed by giving principals powers to determine how much should be paid," Wetang'ula added.
