National secondary schools 100m champion Beatrice Anyango wants to sign off from age-grade athletics by representing the country at next year's World U-20 Championships. Anyango, who represented the country during the World U- 17 Championships in Nairobi in 2017, is currently training at Sang'oro Secondary School regional  camp in preparation for next year's showpiece. Sang'oro is one of the camps identified by Athletics Kenya to train athletes ahead of the WU-20 championships. “It was my first time to represent Kenya. I didn't do well because I faltered in the preliminaries. This time round, I'm targeting the finals and a podium finish because I have gained some experience especially off the starting blocks,” the former student at Kowuor Mixed in Homa Bay County. Anyango has a personal best of 12:48 in 100m and 25:39 in 200m  and will be seeking to run both events in Nairobi. “I want to win both events at the national trials. It will be my last event at junior level so I want to sign off in style,” she said. She is the only junior international at the camp and wants to inspire her colleagues. “Most of the athletes at this camp have not represented Kenya, during our free time.  I encourage them to train hard and remain disciplined. Getting to the national team is not easy like walking to the market,” she added. Quinter Atieno the national secondary schools triple jump champion also dreams of representing  the country alongside shot putter Elizabeth Adhiambo.
