He called his next-door neighbour a prostitute and a witch and threatened to evict her from her house after she returned from upcountry. The accusations have landed Edwin Ouma, 32, in court. He has been charged before Makadara senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji with creating a disturbance and breaching the peace by using abusive words against Marceline Ochenge on Kaloleni estate, Nairobi, on December 9. He denied any wrongdoing and was granted Sh10,000 bail. The court heard that Marceline had returned with her husband and children and Ouma attempted to restrain her from entering her house. He then told her husband and the children that she had been "bringing different men" to her house. He allegedly started breaking Marceline's roof, prompting her to report to their location chief. Officers from Makongeni police station were informed and they arrested Ouma. The case will be heard from April 15 next year. (Edited by F'Orieny)
