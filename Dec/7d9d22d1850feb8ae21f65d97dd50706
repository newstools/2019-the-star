Nairobi football lovers were treated to the ultimate watch and play night football experience on Friday at the Halycon Lounge and Grill, Kitengela. Revellers battled to become the first champions of Guinness Night Football and win a direct ticket to Lagos, Nigeria, for the pan-African championship. Performed included Samidoh, Boondocks Gang, Ethic, Lavosti Band and Khaligraph giving breath-taking performances on stage. Mc Pengele hosted the event with (DJ) Teargas and Gibbz on decks spinning incredible music. The event follows successful Night Football events in Kisumu, Machakos and Nakuru, where consumers got a chance to interact with the brand as they watched live football matches.
