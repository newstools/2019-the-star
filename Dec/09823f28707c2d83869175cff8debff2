Migori Woman Rep Pamela Odhiambo has been asked to complete a stalled gender -based violence rescue centre. The facility in Maeta, Kuria East subcounty, was started by her predecessor and now nominated MP Dennitah Ghati as a safe haven for Kuria girls running away from FGM. Among the Kuria community only girls form Bwirege clan among four are undergoing circumcision this festive season. Women and activists want the centre which has stalled for close to five years completed. “Having a gender-based violence rescue centre in Migori has been the main agenda for women and activists in the last two general elections, which should not be the case in 2022 General Election,” said Benter Adhiambo of Micontrap. She said women and girls shunning FGM have opted to seek shelter with relatives or move across the border in Tanzania, “which is very unsafe and costly as it increases cases of gender-based violence like sexual assault for women. “We want the office of the woman representative to complete the rescue in Maeta, or build a new one.” Salome Robi, a mother from Rosabare, said she was circumcised and the negative effects made her keep away her three daughters from the practice. “My parents have been pushing to have the girls circumcised. I have been forced to always have them visit relatives during the season which is expensive,” Robi said. Mary Nyamohanga, a mother, said her two daughters are in Masongora in Tanzania until schools re-open. The two said they suffered pain during birth, low sexual drive and early marriage which disrupted their education. They don’t want their children to go through a similar experience. Currently, Komotobo Mission Centre managed by Maranatha Church is the only rescue facility in Migori but has low capacity.
