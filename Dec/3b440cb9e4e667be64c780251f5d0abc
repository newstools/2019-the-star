Heavy rains, which are likely to continue in January, have caused severe flooding across Kenya. Somalia, Sudan and Uganda are also suffering from floods and landslides. The immediate cause of the heavy rain is the Indian Ocean dipole which is the difference in temperature between the eastern and western sides of the ocean. It is now over two degrees, the highest ever, and this is causing intense evaporation and precipitation. Things are not going to get much better. Next year the Met Office is predicting extended drought. In the medium term, population growth will push more people to live in risky areas in mountains and flood plains. Tree planting is already underway in forests but this should be extended into roadside verges and every available space. Renewable energy should be increased. The Lamu coal plant and diesel generation should be halted. Police should enforce strict rules on particle emissions by vehicles. The developed world is responsible for most carbon emissions but Kenya should still try to protect its own environment. This is global warming and it needs an ambitious Kenyan action plan like BBI.
