The Coast Water Services Board has disconnected supply in Taita Taveta for repairs, causing an acute water shortage in Voi town and its environs. The water shortage has been caused by ongoing major repairs at the Mzima main pipeline that supplies water to Taita Taveta, Kwale and Mombasa counties. “There will be an interruption of water supply to pave way for major repairs at the Mzima pipeline. Supply will be restored once the repair works are complete,” a notice by Taita Taveta Water and Sewerage Company (Taveto) reads. The repair works are being undertaken by Coast Water Works Development Agency. Other affected areas are Maungu Miasenyi, Taita village and Makina Road among others. This comes as the region is recovering from Sunday's flash floods that displaced 300 families. The situation hurt business in Voi town and services in health institutions. Most hotels have been forced to close for fear of an outbreak of waterborne diseases. “With the current floods, it is very risky to sell food without a steady supply of clean water. We have closed until supply is restored,” Margie Kiseu, a hotel operator in Sophia Estate,told the Star on Wednesday. Resident Jacinta Kililo slammed Taveto for giving late alerts on water disconnection, pointing out that most residents had not stored water. “The water body has once again exhibited its high levels of incompetence. How do they give notice more than seven hours after disconnecting water supply? ” she asked. She said hundreds of residents in the badly affected areas are forced to walk long distances in search of water. A spot check by the Star revealed that water vendors are inflating their prices — a 20-litre jerrican sells for Sh100, up from the usual Sh20. Residents called on the county government to develop strategies to harvest rainwater that wreaks havoc every rainy season. Edited by R.Wamochie
