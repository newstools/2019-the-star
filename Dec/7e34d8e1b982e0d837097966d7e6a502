The first Bible translated into Samburu language was on Saturday launched at Kenyatta Stadium in Maralal town. The New Testament copies were transported on a donkey from Bible Translation and Literacy office in Maralal town to Kenyatta Stadium as Christians sang and danced. “Today is a day of happiness for Samburus because we now have our own Bible. We now know that Jesus understands Samburu language too,” Julia Leaduma said. Resident James Leleina said the community has been using Bibles that were translated in Maasai and Swahili languages. Deputy President William Ruto attended. Also present were Samburu Senator Steve Lelegwe, Governor Moses Lenolkulal and Samburu North MP Alois Lentoimaga. Residents had been told to buy a copy at Sh150 for the 5,000 copies available. However, Ruto paid for the 5,000 copies so that residents can get the bible at Sh10 only. “We have come with Sh150 to buy the new Bible but the deputy president has paid. We will get a copy at only Sh10,” John Learos said. National director for Bible Translation and Literacy Peter Munguti said the translation of the Bible into Samburu language was aimed at bringing transformation to the region. “When the Bible becomes available in local languages, it becomes a tool for evangelism and discipleship," he said. Munguti said the Bible is also available in digital and audio format as plans to translate the Old Testament continues.
