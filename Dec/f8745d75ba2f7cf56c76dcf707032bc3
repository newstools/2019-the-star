The late Laikipia county assembly Majority leader Ephraim Wachira, alias Kamakia, was remembered yesterday as a dedicated leader. Kamakia died in 2015 shortly after delivering his Jamhuri Day speech in Nanyuki Stadium. The Ngobit MCA in Laikipia East died on the way as he was taken to Nanyuki Cottage Hospital. Jamhuri celebrations yesterday provided another opportunity for county leaders to pay tribute to their former colleague. Majority Peter Thomi (Githiga) and Minority Jacob Edom (Sossian) were among those who spoke. "Kamakia was a leader who endeavoured to see his ward and the county develop. It was a great loss not only to his family members but also to the people of Laikipia at large," Thomi said. In his unusually long speech, Wachira had criticised the government saying it was taking Laikipia for granted, pointing out the poor state of roads. "In 2017, we will not accept to be cheated with prime positions at the expense of the county’s development,” he told the gathering. At one time, a heckler shouted that Wachira had talked for too long but he diplomatically responded that he was doing what he knows best — fighting for his people. After delivering the speech, he handed over the microphone to Deputy Speaker Peter Kimondo and returned to his seat. He passed out moments later and was rushed to a hospital with county executives and MCAs in tow. The 2015 celebrations were thrown into disarray. Many seats on the dais were left vacant as the sad news filtered in that the MCA had passed away before reaching the hospital.
