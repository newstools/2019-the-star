Fresh produce prices have risen in Mumias ahead of Christmas, a spot check shows. At the open market in Mumias and Shibale towns, tomatoes were selling at between Sh10, 000 to Sh12,000 per crate. Most of traders were selling tomatoes at a retail price of Sh10 apiece for the bigger ones and three small ones at Sh20. They attributed the rise in price to high demand and said the heavy rains had affected production of the crop which they source from Mt Elgon subcounty. The price of cabbages has gone up to Sh50 from Sh30 one week ago. The cabbages are however in good supply in the markets. Traders however indicated business in the town had generally gone down following the collapse of Mumias sugar factory where most of the buyers worked. “At this time of the year I would have sold double what I have done now,” said Jane Auma who has a vegetable stall at Shibale market near the factory. A 2kg tin of dry maize sold at Sh85, beans Sh200, green grams Sh250 while the same measure of ground nuts fetched Sh350. Leading supermarkets in town have attracted many buyers. Most supermarkets have filled their shelves to the brim as the demand for consumer goods has gone up. Dealers in clothes have also recorded high sales.
