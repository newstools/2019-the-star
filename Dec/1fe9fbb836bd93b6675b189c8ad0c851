Athletics Kenya (AK) have identified 14 camps to train youth and junior athletes in preparation for next year's World Athletics Under-20 Championships in Nairobi. The camps were identified following credible criteria based on various considerations and in consultations with stakeholders and ministries. The camps will be based in various secondary schools across the country. They include Kwanthanze, Riruta, Iuani, Ngooru, Kiptere, Emurwa Dikkir, Torongo, Moi Kapcherop, Chewoyet, Kaptama, Mogonga PAG, Sang'oro Secondary and Keringet Boarding Primary school in Nakuru County. The camps, which started on December 1 will close on December 21. The federation has also appointed a coordinator for the camps, according to Athletics Kenya Youth Committee chairman Barnabas Korir. He said the camps will identify, nurture and develop talent. “The federation has appointed a camp coordinator to oversee the day-to-day running of the camps and the training sessions in liaison with coaches and a chaperon,” added Korir in his letter. In Nyanza North, AK chairman Joseph Ochieng said the camp at Sang'oro Secondary will kick off on Saturday. “We are waiting for AK to release the money for the camp. I have been assured that the money will be in our accounts by Wednesday (today). We expect athletes to arrive on Friday because we have already identified them,”  he noted. On Sunday, AK Nyanza South chairman Peter Angwenyi officially launched Mogonga PAG camp which has so far attracted 77 upcoming athletes. “More athletes are coming to Mogonga as we speak. We were asked to have 50 but we got more and we can't send them away,” said the coordinator and principal Haron Onchong'a. “We have athletes who reached regionals and nationals in primary and secondary athletics championships who are keen to represent the country next year,” Onchong'a added.
