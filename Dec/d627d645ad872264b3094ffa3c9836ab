ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi is working on a partnership with President Uhuru Kenyatta ahead of 2022 race, Lugari MP Ayub Savula has said. Addressing the press in Kakamega town on Saturday, Savula said Mudavadi to work closely with Uhuru with an aim of forming a formidable alliance that would hand him the presidency. He said the recent visit to Garissa County by the two demonstrated the morphing alliance between them. "We are going to convene a party NEC meeting soon to review the relationship between the two," he said. "When President Kenyatta asked his Mt. Kenya backyard to stop following other politicians seeking to succeed him and wait for a surprise candidate he was referring to Mudavadi," he said. The frosty relationship between Uhuru and his Deputy William Ruto has forced him[Ruto] to look elsewhere for support of his 2022 bid after it became apparent that he could not rely on the Mt Kenya region. Savula said that the two leaders have been holding frequent meetings and more will follow in the near future. The lawmaker said that the former Vice-president cannot deputize Deputy President William Ruto in 2022. He said that the law already bars the DP from serving in the same position for more than ten years and can therefore not deputize Mudavadi. While addressing 1, 400 delegates from Kakamega county at his Sugoi home on Wednesday, the DP said that he was ready to support either Mudavadi or his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang'ula for the 2022 race as long as they convinced him that they had better chances of winning the presidency. Mudavadi has been re-branding himself as the face of official opposition after the March 9, 2018 handshake between President Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. Jubilee MPs from Western have been pushing Mudavadi to team up with Ruto for the 2022 race as a neighbor.
