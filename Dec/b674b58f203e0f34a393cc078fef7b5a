Marathon world record holder Eliud Kipchoge was on Friday awarded an honorary doctorateÂ degree in science from Laikipia University. He received the degree for his contribution to the field of sports. Kipchoge made history in October by being the first human to run a marathon in under two hours. Kipchoge crossed the finish line in 1:59:40. Asked how he felt about running under two hours, he said, "I'm the happiest man. I'm feeling good. It's taken 65 years for a human being to make history. I have tried... It means no man is limited." Laikipia University said," The University Senate in making this award noted that Eliud has made tremendous contributions to the realm of sports. The Senate specifically recongises his most recent achievement of becoming the first human in history to run a sub-two-hour marathon."
