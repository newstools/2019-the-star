Three people including a two- year- old child drowned in separate incidents in Makueni on Sunday after heavy rains. In the first incident, two-year-old Mary Mumbi drowned in a well at their Ngiluni village home in Mukaa sub-county. County police Commander Joseph ole Naipeyan said the child was trying to draw water on Sunday evening when she slipped and fell into the well and drowned. In the second incident, Keli Matata, 22, was swept away by raging River Muoni waters in Mbitini, Nzaui sub-county. He was trying to cross the flooded river while drunk, according to Naipeyan. The body was found floating downstream at 8.30am on Sunday. "Matata was on a drinking spree on Saturday night at Kalongo market but did not return home. Police suspect that he was swept away when he was crossing the river," he said. He said the two bodies were at Kilome Nursing Home mortuary. In Kilungu sub-county, Kaindi Ndambuki drowned while crossing River Kanyo. Naipeyan said the body of the 65- year-old man was found on Sunday morning. Nineteen people in Makueni have died in flood-related incidents this month. The rains had subsided last week, but a downpour was experienced on Saturday night, rendering many roads impassable.
