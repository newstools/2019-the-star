The case against nine suspects charged with the deaths of 48 people following the Solai Dam tragedy 18 months ago will be determined next month. Naivasha chief magistrate Kennedy Bidali has set January 20, 2020 as the date when he will issue directions of the case that has failed to proceed for the last one year. The magistrate was set to make a ruling on whether the case would be dismissed following an application by the defense counsels over the delayed matter. The magistrate said heavy workload had delayed his ruling. The nine suspects including businessman Perry Manusukh Kanasagara are charged with 48 counts of manslaughter and failing to prepare an environmental impact assessment report. The other eight are Vinoj Jaya Kumar, Johnson Njuguna, Luka Kipyegen, Winnie Muthoni, Jacinta Were, Tomkin Odo Odhiambo, Williec Omondi and Lynette Cheruiyot. The office of the DPP apologized for delaying the case, saying they are now ready to proceed. Prosecutor Wangui Gichohi apologized for not turning up on Thursday when the case was meant to start. “The office of the DPP apologizes for failing to turn up for the hearing of the case earlier in the week and we promise that this will not happen again,” she told the court. Earlier, advocate FI Mburu told of the agony the suspects were undergoing as they waited for the case to kick off. While calling on the court to dismiss the charges, Mburu said that the prosecution was not interested in the case and hence the frequent adjournments. “The suspects are entitled to a speedy trial but the office of the DPP is not interested in this and we are asking the court to allow the matter to proceed to full trial or dismiss the case,” he said.
