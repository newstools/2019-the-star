Kenya Bankers Association has been sued over allegations of stealing the idea to come up with an interbank transfer solution, popularly known as Pesalink. Stephen Muikia Njongoro on Thursday said Pesalink bears similar salient features and components to his original idea, which had expressed to the association in early 2015. He believes the association has been illegally using his idea for commercial benefit. And as a result he wants the court to stop the use of Pesalink, arguing KBA has infringed on his copyright and denied him royalties. Njongoro said from KBA’s website, there are about 30 banks that use Pesalink and more than three million registered accounts. He narrated in his suit papers how he spent resources to come up with the innovation. Njongoro said the idea came about when he was working at Co-operative Bank as a teller in April 2010. It was then that he realised there was a gap to conduct inter-bank transfers and he decided to give it a go. His idea is known as “All in one banking innovation” and a slogan “All in one, Huduma zote za benki zote or lipa na benki yako” which he registered with Kenya Copyrights Board, on February 2, 2015.
