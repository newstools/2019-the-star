 A civil society group has threatened to organise nationwide demonstrations if the price of unga is not lowered before Christmas. The Ondoa Panya Movement says the price of maize flour has risen in recent weeks, pushing Kenyans to just one meal a day. The movement's coordinator John Wamagata said prices of basic commodities had risen and consequently pushed up the cost of living. He said the national government must come up with a strategy to lower the cost of living before December 25 or they organise protests. Wamagata said families were faced with hard times due to skyrocketing food prices. He urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to take the matter seriously and save Kenyans. "We are planning to hold protests if we get to Christmas with these costs. If our plans succeeds, we shall hold it in all the major towns of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru and narrow it down to trading centers,‚Äù Wamagata said. He said parents cannot manage modest festivities given they also have to plan for next year's school fees. "The government must come in and save its people. Things are not working out well for many families and President Uhuru Kenyatta must know this," Wamagata said. He spoke on Saturday when he led other lobby groups in relaunching the Unga Revolution at Quarry village in Kinoo, Kikuyu constituency. He was accompanied by Bunge la Wananchi president Josphat Waema and other human rights activists. The cost of a 2kg packet of maize flour has risen from between Sh90 and Sh110 up to Sh135 and Sh200 depending on the unga brand. Waema asked Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri to resign saying he has failed to manage the docket. He said the ministry has put many lives at risk of malnutrition. "The government should not wait until people start being diagnosed with diseases caused by malnutrition or to the extreme dying due to hunger. The situation is already serious and the government must act," Waema said.  edited by p. obuya
