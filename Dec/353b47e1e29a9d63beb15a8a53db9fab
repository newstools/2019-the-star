The animal the public mistakenly reported to be on the loose in Kajiado county was a serval cat rather than a leopard, KWS has clarified. KWSÂ  on Monday said its veterinary capture team located the animal and is treating her for injuries she sustained while trying to force her way out of the scene. "The team will thereafter release her back to the wild where she belongs. We are grateful to members of the public who shared with us tips on the whereabouts of the serval cat," KWS said. The service advised the public to report any sightings of wild animals in community areas to 0720261047 or 0720210738.
