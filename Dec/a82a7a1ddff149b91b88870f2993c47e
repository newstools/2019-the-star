Daniel Ndambuki, well known to many as Churchill, has shut down rumours that show director J Blessing was fired. Talking to Word Is on Tuesday, Churchill said, "He has not been fired from Laugh Industry. Who said he has been released from Churchill Show?" He said Blessing will be working on new projects with Laugh Industry come 2020. "In fact, we have other shows coming up. Starting in January, we have shows with him. He is part of the show. Just because he has not been in two or three shows doesn't mean he is not part of the show. As I mentioned, we are working on new projects," Churchill said. The comedian went on to rubbish rumours that Blessing was released after his PA wasn't provided with a plane ticket to Kisumu. "That is just a story that has been fabricated," he said.
