WRC Safari Rally Project secretary Helen Shiri has been elected as a member of the FIA women in motorsport commission. Shiri, who is also the Rallye Sports Club clerk of the course, becomes the second Kenyan rally personality to land a slot in FIA commissions after KMSF chairman Phineas Kimathi joined the WRC Commission earlier this year. Shiri was also nominated as the African representative in the commission following the FIA General Assembly held on December 6 2019 in Paris. This year, the commission welcomes new members from 7 different National Sporting Authorities (ASNs) as well as a new marketing representative. They are Shiri, Anna Nordkvist (Sweden), Hugh Chambers (Britain), Nathalie Moutet (Mexico), Janette Tan (Singapore), Lily Hong (China), Sita Raina (India) and Ellie Norman, F1 director of marketing & communications. In short, Shiri will act as an ambassador for the African region and as a leader to fast-forward gender equality programmes. This is another first for Shiri who became the first Kenyan woman to finish a rally beyond borders on the 2013 edition of the Pearl of Africa Uganda Rally. Shiri, formerly with the famous “Warembo Bila Mekap’ team and now Amira Hedgal savoured the rare opportunity to lead the continent on matters motorsports. She is excited to be part and parcel of the growing list of women seeking to bolster the fortunes of women in the male dominated sport.
