A lot of things have gone wrong in the recent past. The only things worth talking about are the frequent conquests of the likes of Eliud Kipchoge and his retinue of athletics achievers. There is hardly anything to write home about politics, religion, football, even education before the likes George Magoha and Fred Matiang'i are fished out of the academia to reign sanity in school examinations. How did we end up with the likes of Mike Sonko and Ferdinard Waititu in the corner offices of our devolved units? Our governance situation is so pitiable that we have become the laughing stock of neighbouring Tanzania and Rwanda who will not blink an eye lecturing us on how we are losing our No 1 position in regional leadership. The Kenyan citizenry is dazed by crafty demagogues who they elect every election cycle as if to confirm what lousy and gullible citizens we are. We cheer when our tribesman is in a position to spread the peanuts after selling national passports to foreign criminals and dishing out tenders to broke Italian companies. Our days of glory will soon be behind us unless somebody somewhere waves a magical governance wand to save us from ourselves.
