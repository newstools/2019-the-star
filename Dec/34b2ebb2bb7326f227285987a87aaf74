A Kisumu court has upheld the county assembly's decision to impeach former Speaker Onyang'o Oloo. Oloo had in September gone to court under a certificate of urgency seeking his reinstatement. The county assembly and the county assembly service board were the respondents while acting speaker Elisha Oraro and two others were listed as interested parties. The MCAs impeached Oloo citing an active corruption investigation at the Lake Basin Development Authority against him. On Tuesday, Employment and Labour court Judge Justice Nduma Nderi dismissed the case for lack of merit. Nduma said the impeachment motion was passed by 42 members of county assembly constituting 75 per cent of the MCAs. The judge further ordered Oloo to return any county assembly property in his possession. However, Oloo has said he will appeal the court's decision. Oloo while filling the case claimed that his replacement was a contravention of the provisions of Article 178 (1) of the Constitution. He was fighting to have all the benefits, allowances and privileges he enjoyed as the speaker of the county assembly reinstated. In the court documents, Oloo claims that he was not allowed to defend himself against allegations raised. Through his lawyer Muga Apondi, Oloo said that the actions by the assembly resulted in an infringement on his fundamental rights and freedoms. “It is in the interest of justice that this honourable court intervenes at this juncture to arrest the illegality and violations of the constitution and the law,” the petition read. But the assembly said his impeachment was lawful as the decision of the house business committee was communicated to him.
