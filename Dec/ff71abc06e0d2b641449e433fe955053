TV personalities Joyce Omondi and Waihiga Mwaura attended the Kalasha Awards last weekend. Omondi had been nominated for best TV host 2019 for her show Full Circle with Joyce on Switch TV. Omondi, who addresses life’s issues on her show, gave some marriage advice when Word Is caught up with her. “Put God at the centre of it all. That’s my biggest advice. I don’t know how people do it without God. For me, that has been the best thing ever," she said. “Marriage takes work, but it works.” She and Waihiga have kept their relationship off social media. Omondi also spoke about her show and what fans can expect next year. “I was grateful and in shock for the nomination and was also grateful to my fans, who make the show what it is,” she said. “It’s important to always have sobriety. It means I should work harder and keep trying and appreciating the people that come together to keep doing what I do.”
