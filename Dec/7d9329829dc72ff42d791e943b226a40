Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) on Monday restored  supply of medical commodities to Taita Taveta County. The agency supplied pharmaceuticals worth Sh49 million and renal items worth Sh4 million, ending a long medical supplies dry spell. The county had been blacklisted for failing to pay huge bills owed to Kemsa and other pharmaceutical suppliers. In April 2019, Health Services executive Daniel Makoko said the county owed Kemsa Sh52 million, Lancet Kenya Sh48 million and Mission for Essential Drugs and Supplies Sh16.9 million. Makoko said the debt had accumulated since 2016. However, the  County Government has serviced the outstanding debt that had resulted in stoppage of supplies. Speaking while receiving the supplies at the newly established County Drug Store in Wundanyi, the County Chief Officer incharge of health Philomena Kirote underscored the government's commitment in delivering affordable and accessible quality healthcare to all citizens. “Lack of supply of enough medical commodities had caused a public outcry from the county residents demanding for quality healthcare which is one of the fundamental human rights. As a department we have put strategic mechanisms to avoid medical stock out in our facilities, wastage and theft of pharmaceuticals and non- pharmaceuticals,”  Kirote said. She said the creation of a central County Drug Store would help monitor drug usage, avoid wastage through over-stocking, and facilitate direct ordering of drugs with short shelf life from Kemsa. "All health facilities shall be accessing supplies from a centralise placed. From this point,we can monitor the usage of our drugs,"Kirote added. Kirote warned that stealing of drugs will not be condoned noting that the drugs will be supplied to hospitals on a need basis.
