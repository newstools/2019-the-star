Fresh from winning Rwanda Open recently, Ismael Changawa has set his sights on winning the Egypt Futures Open tournament in February next year. Changawa, a three-time Kenya Open champion, said the Egypt Futures Open tournament will be ideal preparation for the Davis Cup playoff showdown against Indonesia In March. "The Egypt event will be a very good warm up to test myself against some of the best players on the continent and the world and it will put me in the right shape for the playoff,” he added. Changawa returned to his best at the Rwanda Open after two months out with a nagging shoulder injury—dispatching Kevin Cheruiyot 6-3, 6-2 in the final. “My shoulder feels fine and playing at the Rwanda Open has given me confidence for the next year. Getting all the way to the final and winning was good for future tournaments,” he noted. He said there are several facets of play he wants to improve on before the Davis Cup playoff match. "I have a lot to improve on especially my returns and movement on the court and its something which I am working on currently,” he noted.  Changawa is part of the Davis Cup squad that includes Ibrahim Kibet, Kevin Cheruiyot and Albert Njogu. The quartet has stepped its training for the Davis Cup and Chanagawa is confident they can pull off an upset against Indonesia. “We have played several international tournaments and I believe the exposure will be vital if we are to beat Indonesia at their backyard,” he noted. He said the quartet have nothing to lose in facing Indonesia. “We respect their players but we don't fear them. It all boils down to  the mentality and determination to succeed in the matches we are going to play,” added Changawa.
