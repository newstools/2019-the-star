Every woman who gives birth in a Laikipia health facility will be rewarded with one goat. Women and traditional midwives will also get a goat for taking a woman to a health facility. The government decided on the incentive because deliveries in health facilities are much safer for mother and baby than home deliveries. Women's groups in Laikipia North subcounty have been urged to take the lead in ensuring that women deliver in health facilities. Laikipia Deputy Governor John Mwaniki made the announcement on Tuesday when he met women from the Chui Women's Group in Waso Village, Mukogodo West ward. â€œThough there's a mobility problem in rural Laikipia North, the county has also employed community health workers and volunteers who have data o expectant mothers in their locality with expected delivery dates," Mwaniki said. He said many infants develop complications due to lack of proper care during birth. The deputy governor said this could be averted by taking campaigns to residents' doorsteps. Men, the heads of families, were also urged to help end outdated practices of home births that derail the government agenda among pastoralists. Chui Women's Group founder Modesta Ellie said they will ensure other mothers go to hospitals. the group has more than 300 women. She urged the county to provide ambulances near major shopping entres for emergencies. (Edited by V. Graham)
