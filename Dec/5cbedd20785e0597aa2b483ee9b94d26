Jamaican dancehall and reggae musician Mark Anthony Myrie, popularly known as Buju Banton, is set to perform in Mombasa on December 31. The ‘Destiny’ singer made history earlier this year when he filled the National Stadium in Kingston with over 35,000 fans for his first concert, which marked his return home after 10 years of imprisonment in the US. He has been confirmed for the end-of-year concert in Kenya. The award-winning reggae icon, who has been in the industry for over 25 years, is known for his hit songs, such as ‘Love Me Brownin', 'Pull It Up', 'Til I’m laid to rest, and 'Hills and Valleys'. Although details of the concert are still scanty, it is believed that this might be part of Buju Banton’s 'Long Walk To Freedom Tour', which began on March 16 in Kingston, Jamaica. That debut event was attended by stars like Tarrus Riley, Beenie Man, Sean Paul, Romain Virgo, Steflon Don, Konshens, Chris Martin and Gramps Morgan. On December 8 last year, Banton was released from jail after seven years of a 10-year jail sentence. He was put behind bars by a Florida court in 2011 over drug-related charges.
