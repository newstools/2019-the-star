Groups of youths from the border town of Hulugho on Sunday  accused the government of abandoning insecurity prone areas as several essential services have collapsed. Speaking at a press conference in Garissa town, they said there is shortage of food since the road has been rendered impassable and there are no plans to fix infrastructure in the area. They painted a picture of an area isolated without communication or electricity and with shortage of teachers as well lack of drugs in the local dispensary. Al Shabaab militants have several times destroyed the Safaricom mast in the area. It has not been replaced since they last damaged the vital installation in August 2018. The militants have also carried out attacks targeting security officers by planting improvise explosive devices on roads. “Because of the poor state of the roads, no vehicle has accessed the area for the last three months. With no communication, we are concerned the life of our people in the area,” Abdi Bare said. The military accompanied by area MP Sophia Abdinoor have been distributing food and other relief items to far areas. However the youths said that was just a drop in the ocean as there is huge suffering in the area. Bare said Hulugho located just 18km from the border has no shortage of security personnel but they should change strategy to ensure safety of people and their property. “We asked all elected leaders from the governor to ward representatives to immediately intervene and find solution,” Abdikadir Kilas said. He said electricity equipment for the area was brought 10 years ago but has never been installed despite the need to have power in border town. “There is a hospital that needs power, schools and even business. Any economy needs power for progress. That is why we are saying the area is totally abandoned by the government,” he said. The youth demanded immediate installation of power as well fixing of roads and enhancement of security.
