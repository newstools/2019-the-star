Neno Evangelism founder Pastor James Nganga has rubbished claims he is in hiding after he was involved in a hit-and-run accident. A tweep, identified as Abraham Mutai, claimed the pastor is in hiding after causing an accident along Namanga Road. But speaking to Word Is on the phone on Wednesday, Nganga denied being there. “I don't know why people have so many stories about me. I was not there. Even if I bought the car, I hear it has hit a lorry that was parked somewhere, but I was not there. I can't hide and if anyone wants to know where I am, just search for my number," he said. “I’m not hiding. Watu waangalie number plate ya gari wajue kama ni yangu. I have my cars, hotel and currently, I am building a prayer house in Jerusalem. That’s where I have been going. Ati wanasema najificha.” He added, “I’m in the same category with DP Ruto and I don’t want my name to be clean, you call me controversial. Nilikohoa mkaitika,” he said. Nganga, who was agitated, asked, “Mnataka nitrend kwa nini? Kama mama wa ‘twa twa’ alitrend, mimi ni nani? Acha nitrend, my God will fight for me.”
