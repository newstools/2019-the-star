Krystal, wife of gospel artist Rufftone, is back to making music. The singer took a break from her career after her wedding to focus on her marriage and family. Speaking to Word Is on Monday Rufftone said he is thrilled at his wife's decision. "My wife had stopped singing because of family engagements. We were newlywed and children and spending time with each other took a chunk of our career," he said. "She sacrificed and chose to concentrate on our marriage. "Once a singer always a singer. Once you have been bitten by [the] music bug you cannot avoid it and it has been burning in her since then. "Just because the family came does not mean her career entirely stopped." Rufftone said his wife has been longing to go back to producing music. "I am the one who told her to come back but she also had wanted to. I am 1000 percent behind her because of the sacrifice she made for us and our family," he said. "The guilt on my side was overwhelming. Nowadays women focus most on career and not family." Rufftone said nowadays it's hard to find a wife who puts family before career so when you find such a one you cherish her. "When you get a wife who focuses on her family and not her career, it would be the most dishonourable thing not to support her," he said. "Because of that, I am behind her. We are working on a project and it will be ready by 2020. Her fans have been committed to her and tell her [they're glad] she is back." The two were in Dubai, where Krystal recorded the video of her new song. The comeback video was shot at the 7-star Burj Al Arab hotel after the two attended a praise night hosted by Pastor Dill Kumar at Alnoor Centre. The couple is blessed with two kids.
