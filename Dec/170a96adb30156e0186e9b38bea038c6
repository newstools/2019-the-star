Nearly half of criminal cases filed at the Narok Law Courts every year are children-related, Justice Justus Bwanwong’a has said. The court filed a total of 720 criminal cases this year of which 300 involve children. Justice Bwanwong’a said that out of the 300 cases, a majority are sexual offences such as defilement. He spoke during Narok Court Users Committee open day for gender rights. The judge said that the judicial system has struggled to solve these cases due to various challenges and hence a backlog. “We have been experiencing various challenges. For instance, the court deals with a lot of cases that vary from police, criminal, appeal among others,” he said. In Narok, interference by social-cultural systems of resolving cases, unavailable witnesses and insufficient funds to facilitate witnesses slow the wheels of justice. The judge urged parents to be close and open with their children and listen to what they had to say and address the issues raised. Narok children's officer Pilot Khaemba said the county lacks a protection unit for children rescued from abuse. Khaemba also asked the court and the community to ensure that children were well supported during the child justice chain link. “Children's cases should not be solved at the community level and parents should be responsible for their children by following up with them,” he added.
