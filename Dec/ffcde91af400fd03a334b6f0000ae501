Teachers in Bungoma have promised to mobilise residents to re-elect Governor Wycliffe Wangamati in 2022 polls. They said Wangamati had honoured his 2017 campaign pledge by employing most of them in his government. The teachers spoke on Saturday at Nasianda village in Kimilili constituency during the thanksgiving party of the chief officer in the governor’s office, Denson Barasa. Barasa is the brother of Kimilili MP Didimus Barasa. He was the Bungoma county Kuppet chairperson before he was appointed by Wangamati to serve in his government. Wangamati also picked former Kimilili Boys principal Patrick Wandili as Health chief officer and Keya Sabwami as his public administration CEC. Kimilili MP pledged to support Wangamati’s regime to ensure development. The lawmaker promised to be the chief campaigner for Wangamati’s re-election in 2022. "I will be the front-line to support Wangamati after he gave my elder brother a job in his regime and many other teachers across Bungoma," he said. Bungoma East Knut secretary general Aggrey Namisi said teachers have a history of serving with integrity in any organisation they have been employed to work. Wangamati said teachers are honest and reliable.
