Kabras centre Nick Barasa has been ruled out for the next six weeks with a recurring knee injury . Assistant coach Edwin Acahyo said Barasa injured his knee in training and may need surgery if the situation doesn't improve in the new year. “We are exploring options to and if the knee does not get better, then he may be forced to undergo surgery at some point,” added Achayo. Barasa has been a pillar for the sugar millers since promotion to the top flight in 2015. He played key roles as they bagged their first-ever Kenya Cup in 2016 and won the Enterprise Cup last year against Impala (37-7) in the final. Barasa has also played for the Simbas in several test matches. He is slated to miss matches against Homeboyz, Menengai Oilers, Nakuru RFC, Quins and Kisumu RFC. Skipper Max Adaka should be fit and available for the clash against third-placed Homeboyz on Saturday at the Jamhuri Park show ground after slight ankle knock. Achayo said the team is taking one match at a time despite their unbeaten run which has seen them top the standings with 34 points. “We are not getting ahead of ourselves. It's a very long season and there will be twists and turns,” he added. The former Kenya international hailed the impact of new signings of Fijian duo —Timoci Senaite, and Avisai Kuruyawa— alongside South African Ntabeni Dukisa. “They have gelled well with the rest of the team and the combinations are working. The hunger and desire of the team is good,” he added. Kabras have amassed 34 points from seven matches after a 47-0 demolition of Western Bulls over the weekend in the Ingo derby. Champions KCB are second on 30 points with Homeboyz third on 29 points. Impala are fourth after the 27-19 Ngong Road derby win over rivals Quins as Mwamba round up the top five on 20 points Kisumu are bottom of the log with four points with Blak Blad on seven and Quins eight points respectively in the relegation positions.
