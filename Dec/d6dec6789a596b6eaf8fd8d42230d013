 A man was on Monday charged with falsely obtaining Sh535,000 from church members with the promise of helping them secure flights to Germany. Abedinega Musyoka was arraigned before Kibera chief magistrate Joyce Gandani when the matter was to be heard. The hearing, however, failed to proceed after the priests and sisters who are key witnesses failed to turn up. Court papers said that Musyoka obtained the cash from Patrick Musa on July 14 in Hardy area of Lang’ata within Nairobi county. Musa was seeking a ticket for church members who were to travel to Germany. “He came to my place of work and introduced himself as a travel agent. He told me that one ticket would cost Sh107,000 and Sh535,000 was required for the whole group,” court papers quote Musa as saying. He reported that the accused person told him to pay the amount at once and that the tickets were to be delivered a day before the traveling date. “I wrote the cheque to him and he left promising to return with the tickets.” The church members proceeded to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport for the journey but realised they had been conned. “We realised the reserved air ticket given to us by the accused person had been cancelled because the payment had not been made. I contacted the accused person but all was in vain." Gandani advised the matter to be resolved out of court but also directed that the hearing proceeds in February if the parties fail to agree.
