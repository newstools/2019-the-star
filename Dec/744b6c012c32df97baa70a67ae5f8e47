Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has arrived at the Milimani Law Court ahead of his arraignment today over graft charges at City Hall. Sonko was transferred from the EACC headquarters under tight police security and arrived at the Milimani Law Court at exactly 7.55 am. A contingent of heavily armed security personnel has been deployed around the court with the roads leading to the area sealed off and traffic re-directed to other adjacent roads. Sonko on Sunday urged his supporters to remain calm as he deals with his situation following his arrest in Voi last Friday. Police have warned his supporters planning to demonstrate that they will be dealt with accordingly. In a press statement, Sonko said his arrest was politically schemed and asked supporters to remain calm. "I urge all my supporters to allow the law enforcement agencies to do their work and let the law take its course. The peace and stability of Nairobi is more important than anything else," Sonko said. His lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui said the governor was badly tortured and needs medication. Kinyanjui has also called for the arrest of a police officer captured in a video beating and mishandling the governor. Sonko spent the weekend behind bars after a judge declined to grant his request for anticipatory bail on Friday. The governor, through his lawyers led by Cecil Miller, had filed an application under a certificate of urgency seeking anticipatory bail. Miller on Friday said Sonko had filed an application relating to issues of integrity against EACC and anti-graft agency's director of investigations Abdi Mohamed which will be heard today. Miller alsoÂ  sought an order granting Sonko reasonable bail terms following his arrest and impending arraignment.
