Rampant livestock thefts have prompted residents of Matungu, Khwisero and Butere in Kakamega county to form vigilante groups to secure their animals. More than 50 stolen head of cattle have been recovered in the last three months and five suspected thieves lynched. Butere resident Patrick Were said at least two animals are stolen from their village every week. He said the thefts will increase with the onset of the Christmas festive season when beef is in high demand. “We fear sunset especially during this rainy season because that is when they strike. You have to sleep with one eye and ear open lest you wake up to an empty cowshed,” Were said. The stolen animals are sold in neighbouring counties. Marama North ward community policing chairman Joseph Ashibende said there is a need for intervention by authorities to end the menace. A mob lynched a suspected cattle thief in Butula on November 13.  He could not account for the five cows he was found with. The animals had been stolen from Mirere village in Matungu constituency. On November 18, Emusunguri and Shikunga villagers lynched four cattle theft suspects. They could not account for  15 head of cattle in the home of one of them. The animals had been stolen from Shiatsala village in Khwisero. The main suspect gave the mob the names of his accomplices. Over 100 head of cattle were stolen in Butere in the past three months. Police say a syndicate uses pick-ups and Probox cars to transport the stolen cattle to neighbouring counties. Butere police commander Alexander Makau cautioned the public against mob justice. His Matungu counterpart Alex Ndili said the police had intensified patrols to deal with the cattle theft menace.
