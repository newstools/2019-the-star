Residents of Muluwa, Sibuka and Igigo villages in Bunyala North ward, Busia county, have disowned a rice farming project funded by the National Irrigation Board. They said the board did not consult them before implementing the project. They spoke on Friday after meeting with officials from the National Irrigation Board at the project site. The residents, who were led by Samson Midi Wanyama, Stephen Ojiambo and Charles Omia, accused the board engineers of failing to involve them and not channelling the waters into the River Nzoia. “We have decided to stop the project because water from the canal has flooded our farms destroying crops,” they said. Residents complained that their children who learn at Sibuka and Igigo primary schools would be unable to go to school in January next year because the water from the canals destroyed the footbridge they use. Residents had been built the footbridge. Efforts to get comments from the National Irrigation Board officers failed after they got into their car in a huff and sped off.
