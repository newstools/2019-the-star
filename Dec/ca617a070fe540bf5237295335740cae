The Kenya Pipeline Company has assured Kenyans that there will be sufficient fuel supply across the country during the festive season. KPC Acting Managing Director Hudson Andambi in a statement on Wednesday said that the current stock is expected to last for the next 17 days. "KPC's current stock position in the country indicates that there are over 214 million litres of petrol, more than 179 million litres of diesel and over 103 million litres of jet fuel available at various depots throughout the country," Andambi said. He added that the company will extend loading hours at various depots in order to meet the high demand. Andambi has further urged the oil marketing companies to place their orders in time so as to enable consumers to access fuel without any struggle. Motorists have also been urged to be careful on the roads during this festive season. The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority last week announced the new retail price for petroleum products for the month of December. The new price announced on December 14 indicated a reduction of super petrol by Sh1.09 per litre, diesel by Sh2.83 while kerosene dropped by Sh1.75 in Nairobi. The announcement came as a relief to motorists and Kenyans as they make their arrangements to travel to various destinations for December celebrations.
