Police patrols play an important role in public service by responding to incidents, deterring and preventing crimes. In all major towns in the country, police night patrols have been reduced into avenues of soliciting of bribes and oppressing innocent citizens.Â  The officers round up people coming from entertainment joints, night shift jobs and late-night commuters, bundle them into police vehicles and ferry them in droves to police stations. Trumped up charges are levelled against them. To buy their freedom, one has to bribe the officers. Bribes range from Sh1,000 to Sh5,000 depending on the status of the arrested. Kenyans fear the police more than robbers at night. Unless something is done, the little confidence Kenyans have in the law enforcers will keep on dwindling.  Nairobi
