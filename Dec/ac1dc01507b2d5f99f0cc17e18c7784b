OVER  300 athletes are expected to grace the annual Nyaribari Masaba constituency cross country meeting on Monday. The event will be staged at Getacho Primary School, Kisii County, according to Athletics Kenya (AK) Gesusu ward chairman Thomas Osano. Osano, who is a former international athlete said he expects an exciting event. “Since this is an open race, we expect athletes from across the county to take part,” he said. The retired long-distance athlete said the event will feature nine main categories including a 10km for senior men and women, 6km for junior women and 8km for junior men.  Other categories include 4km for boys and girls aged between 13 and 15, 2km race for athletes aged 11-12 years and above 55 years. “We shall also have a 1km race for children aged below 10 years. I want to appeal to parents to bring their children for this event,” added Osano. The event is sponsored by the Nyaribari Masaba National Government Constituency Development Fund under the patronage of area MP Ezekiel Machogu. Registration will be free.  Top five winners will receive cash awards. Osano thanked Machogu for sponsoring the event and asked his colleagues in Kisii County to emulate the same. “We want other MPs to use their CDF funds to sponsor athletics events. This is the only way we can promote athletics in Kisii and Nyamira Counties,” he added. “This event will go a long way in unearthing raw talent. We have athletes but they lack exposure and training. We have decided to have many races for young athletes to inspire them,” said Osano.
