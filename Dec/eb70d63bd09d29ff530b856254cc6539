The Vihiga county government has warned the public to be wary of fraudsters using the governor's name to offer fake loans to unsuspecting residents. Governor Wilbur Ottichilo and his Deputy Patrick Saisi issued the warning in the wake of scammers using non-existent county government programmes to defraud the public. “I want the public to be cautious about individuals who have formed fake social media accounts in my name which they are using to con people with a promise of giving them loans. Let me state categorically that there is nothing like Ottichilo loans,” he said. The two leaders revealed that they have reported the issue to detectives who have commenced investigations. Saisi urged those who have already fallen victims to come out and help security agents with relevant information which will lead to the arrest of the fraudsters. “We are reliably informed that these fraudsters are asking for close to Sh2,000 as facilitation fee from interested parties. If you get such people just know they are conmen out to tarnish the name of the governor,” Saisi said. One of the fake ‘Wilbur Ottichilo Loans’ facebook accounts KNA contacted, asked those interested in unsecured easy pay loans of between Sh10,000 and Sh200,000 to submit their details with a facilitation fee of Sh398 to the secretary whose contacts had been attached.
