A civil society group has  asked men not to hide incidents where they are battered by their wives. The 'Voice of Men and Children' on Saturday decried that out of 10 men who are beaten and mistreated by their spouses, only three report the incidents. Chairman James Njenga advised men to share what go through at the hands of their wives with a close friend, a pastor or a marriage counselor. "Our aim is to ensure couples live peaceful, reduce incidences where they take each other before the police or other offices, by attaining responsible and solution oriented families" he sad Speaking at their office in Limuru constituency, Njenga said some of these issues are realised when a man commits suicide. "Men suffer a lot but they hide those sufferings. This very bad and unfortunate" he said. Vomec was registered as an NGO in early December, to counsel couple's, so as to reduce cases of divorce, separation, domestic violence, murder and suicide. "Some of these issues happen, one spouse and the couple's children are left suffering psychologically as well as financially," Njenga said. But he praised women saying that they do not hide their suffering. "Women rush to police or children's offices to seek solutions. At times men are charged before court of law" he said. He was accompanied by the group's vice chairman Felix Ouma, secretary general Josephat Njagi and advisor Cyrus Koimburi.
