The government is pursuing quack weathermen who are sharing false weather warnings on social media. Some are even charging a fee for their information, which is often inaccurate. "These are obviously people who are taking advantage of the adverse effects of the current heavy rains being experienced across the country to prey on innocent, vulnerable and unsuspecting members of the public," said Stella Aura, the director of the Meteorological Department. She said the department does not charge for any of the forecasts it provides to the public. The forecasts are issued daily, weekly, monthly, seasonally and on need basis. She said all the weather and/or climate information issued by the department is presented on the official letterhead, duly signed by the director,  or county directors of meteorological services. "Kindly note that any written weather and climate information that is not on the official KMD letterhead or official social media handle, is not from KMD," she said. Official weather forecasts are regularly reported by the media and the raw forecast can be freely retrieved from the department's website. Currently, there is no specific law against quack meteorologists. However, the proposed Meteorological Bill proposes a three-year jail-term for spreading false meteorological information. Currently, Kenyan farmers often sue the weatherman for alleged misleading information, but they have never won such cases. "The authority is not liable for any damage, loss or injury sustained or alleged to have been sustained, by any person as a result of such person’s reliance on meteorological information provided by the authority," the bill says. The proposed law, published in May, aims to restructure the department, currently domiciled in the ministry of environment, into a world-class weather authority. It will now be known as the Kenya National Meteorological Authority, with an increased, independent budget from the Treasury.
