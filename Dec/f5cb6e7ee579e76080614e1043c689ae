There was a light moment on Wednesday at the Milimani law court after Senator Kipchumba Murkomen was'schooled' by magistrate Douglas Ogoti during the bail ruling of Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko. Murkomen attempted to justify their decision of bringing Sonko, a sick person to court. "He is here because it was part of our advice though the doctors said he should not come... even though you have given orders barring him from office but the role and health of the governor are very important," Murkomen said. But Ogoti interjected asking why they forced a sick person to come to the courts. "Why should you force him while he is sick?" Ogoti posed. Murkomen responded, "We did not want to take chances. There are a lot of allegations.....and a narrative that he is a flight risk..." But Ogoti asked him "So you feared that he would run away? I know you don't practice in our courts. You didn’t have to disturb a sick person from the hospital. I still would have gone ahead and given directions so your fears were unfounded." The court burst out in laughter as the focus shifted to Murkomen. Sonko was on Wednesday granted Sh15 million cash bail or Sh30 million bond. Ogoti in his ruling on Wednesday also barred Sonko from accessing his office saying the county boss can be escorted to pick his belongings from City Hall. The magistrate said he had considered all the charges, losses made, nature of offences and amount involved in each of the accused persons.
