A community based organization has began campaigns of collecting blood following shortage in various health facilities in Homa Bay. The Homa Bay Youth Forum on Thursday started mobilizing residents in the county to donate blood to mitigate the acute shortage in hospitals. The youth group said they were appealing to residents to donate blood to prevent deaths that are associated with anemic conditions, accidents and child births. The organization chairman George Omollo and secretary Felix Orwa said a successful collection of blood would relieve patients who are in dire need of the commodity in Homa Bay hospitals. Speaking to journalists after they launched the exercise in Homa Bay town, Omollo said they plan to move to other towns with mobilization. The chairman said they were working closely with Kenya Red Cross and Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF) and Homa Bay County Referral Hospital. “It pains to see patients die due to lack of essential commodity like blood in our hospitals. We have decided to solve the problem by encouraging residents to donate blood,” Omollo said. Homa Bay needs at least 823 pints of blood every month with the county referral hospital using up-to 321 pints monthly.
