Kenya Airports authority was forced to change the shape of their ChristmasÂ tree after an outburst from Kenyans on Twitter. KOT expressed their disappointment with the Christmas tree outside JKIA with many claiming it doesn't meet the standards of an international airport. The tree looked like it was falling off and did not depict the true nature of the airport. But after hours of making fun of the tree, airport workers were seen putting together the new JKIA Christmas tree on Wednesday night. There was however no statement from Kenya Airports Authority indicating why they had decided to make the change.
