Emmanuel Bor and Evelyn Chirchir yesterday clinched the men's and women's titles during the Safaricom Kisumu 10km road race in Kisumu City. Bor, the winner of Shanghai 10km race in September and Imenti South 15km race last week, won the Kisumu race in 28:32:70. He beat Mosoriot-based Josephat Kipchirchir to second place in 28:53:30 while Betwel Ruto was third in 29:01:50 with Edward Kiprop (29:02:40) fourth. Speaking after the race, Bor said: “It was a very tough race because the course was flat and very fast. I'm not used to these conditions. However, the organisation here was good.” Bor said he was using the event to prepare for a 10km road race in France on December 29. “My agent told me to prepare for my final race of the year. I want to crown the year by winning in France. This has been a good year for me,” said the 26 year old father of two who hails from Nandi County. Second placed Kipchirchir said he lost the race because of  a nagging hamstring injury. “It became worse at 8km and that is why I slowed down. Otherwise, this way my race,” he said. In the women's category, Chirchir (32:30:10) who trains at Keringet in Nakuru County beat Irene Kimahiji (32:52:40) and Judith Jepngetich (33:19:40) to second and third places. “At 8kms, the three of us were head to head but I decided to make a move and see if they would respond. But when I looked back, I realised they were struggling and decided to go for it,” he added. Chrichir winner of this year's Dam Tot Damloop road race in Netherlands added: “I'm very happy because when I came here, my target was top ten finish. The weather was not friendly today but we expected it.” Winners walked home with Sh100, 000 with runners up getting Sh50, 000.  Top ten athletes in each race received cash awards. The race was scaled down from a marathon to a road race after sponsors Safaricom reduced their sponsorship. In the 8km cross country race for local athletes held at Jomo Kenyatta Sports ground, Vincent Odhiambo emerged winner, crossing the  line in 27:37:42 ahead of Evans Omondi (28:13:12) and  Victor Otieno (28:16:94). In the 6km junior women's race Brenda Adhiambo was the winner in 24:42:23 while Celpha Munara came second in 25:04:81 Odhiambo is currently training at Sang'oro Secondary ahead of next year's World Under 20 Championships
