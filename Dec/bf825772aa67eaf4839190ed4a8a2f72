Fantalis Lucy Nduta is the leading Kenyan player at the ongoing 2019 African Youth chess Championships after Round Three played yesterday in Windhoek, Namibia. Playing in the girls' Under-8 category, Nduta has posted 100 per cent wins after three rounds and leads a field of 20 players in the competition that will be played in nine rounds. She beat Ugandan pair of Nadia Mpetura and Grace Zhaherwa in Rounds One and Two respectively, and went on to bring down the Under-8 top seed Ashraf Hafza of Egypt in the third duel. Chess Kenya’s (CK) secretary general, John Mukabi expressed excitement over Nduta’s feat and urged the rest of the Kenyan players to punch above their weights in the remaining rounds. He said: “I am so impressed with Nduta’s performance. We (CK) pray that she keeps up the unbeaten run to the end given that most of our players have lost a round or two.” In the girls' U-14, Sarah Momanyi who comes from the Mukuru Kwa Njenga informal settlements lies fourth after Round Three. She started her campaign on the right footing, edging Namibian Justine Van Der Meer and Woman Candidate Master Mawire Rumbidzai of Zimbabwe in the first two rounds respectively. She then lost to Antonio Renelsa Taiane of Angola in the third round yesterday. Dorcus Wanjala placed fifth after round three in the girls' U-18 category with two wins and a loss. Fresh from winning the girls competitions at the 2019 Light House East Africa showpiece in Mombasa last week, Wanjala bounced back from round one loss to Algerian Nassr Rania. In the subsequent face-offs, she defeated Namibians Horn Caro and Uris Taisha to return on course.
