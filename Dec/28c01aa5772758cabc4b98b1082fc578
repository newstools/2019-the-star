Actress Jacquey Nyaminde, aka Wilbroda, was conned out of Sh80,000 by an aunt. She and her family paid the money so two of her sisters could get jobs at Kenya Airways. â€œI was conned by an auntie. She was known to the family and was married to an uncle of mine. When my uncle died, she disappeared and appeared after a while and contacted my mum to tell her that she had a job at KQ and that my two sisters should pay Ksh 40,000 each." The auntie disappeared with the cash and has never been seen to date, five years later.
