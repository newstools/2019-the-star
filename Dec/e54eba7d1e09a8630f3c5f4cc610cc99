On the backdrop of Kenya’s highest peak, Mt Kenya, the sixth edition of Country Roads Festival took Nanyuki by storm on Saturday. The festival, maintaining its trend following, played hit after hit of the best country music, including 'Walking in Memphis', 'Wagon Wheel', and 'Coward of the County'. Among the lead performers were Sir Elvis, who has jetted in from Texas in the United States, the multi-talented Jeff Koinange and Kidum. Also on the performing stage was Rwanda’s upcoming sensation Hope Irakoze, the winner of TPF-6.
