Margaret Nyakango was on Wednesday sworn-in as the Controller of Budget. She was sworn-in by Chief Justice David Maraga, hours after being approved by a parliamentary committee. Maraga said the Controller of Budget will play an important role in ensuring the prudent and planned use of public funds. "I wish her well in this important assignment," he said. Nyakango was nominated in November by President Uhuru Kenyatta after the term of the former Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo came to an end in August. The parliamentary Finance committee chaired by Kipkelion East MP Joseph Limo approved Nyakango for the job. “Having considered the suitability, capacity, and integrity of the nominee, the committee recommends that the National Assembly approves the nomination and subsequent appointment of Margaret Nyakango,” the report on her vetting reads. During her vetting, Nyakango said she would ensure county governments work towards sustaining their revenue inflows by exploiting more tax sources. She requested that the COB be empowered to not only report on expenditure but also on revenue, adding that her office will help the government widen its tax base. “There is the need for the informal sector to be brought on board in order to widen the tax base. We will ensure the quarterly reports capture as much as possible in terms of implementation of the tax base,” she said. Counties had decried a lack of cash in their accounts due to vacancy in the office of the Controller of Budget.
