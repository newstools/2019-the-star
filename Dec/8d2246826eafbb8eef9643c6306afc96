A Catholic cleric has expressed concern over the high number of youths abusing drugs and alcohol. Kisii Diocese Bishop Joseph Mairura said the number continues to rise, especially during long holidays. He cautioned that the lives of the young people are at stake, with some taking drugs and alcohol to the extent that they cannot express themselves. He called for efforts to fix the problem. The clergyman appealed to parents and guardians to monitor their children and educate them on the importance of good morals. Mairura spoke to The Star at his residence. He cautioned against the adoption of destructive elements of foreign culture spread under the guise of modernity. They disorient lives, he said.  He was accompanied by Vicar General Jeremiah Nyakundi and Parish priest Godfrey Ototo, among other clerics. "Parents should be wary of modern technologies by guiding their children to embrace good morals and shun bad ones. The youth should understand that no matter how well they are educated, drugs and alcohol will never respect them." Bishop Mairura implored parents and guardians to make their families small Christian communities and mould children into responsible individuals who can account for their own actions. Children should be kept busy this festive season so they shun destructive peer group influence, he suggested. Mairura said some parents are unable to discipline their children and leave them to teachers and church leaders, who are unable to instil moral values in them to shape their lives. Meanwhile, the bishop welcomed Pope Francis's appointment of Alfred Rotich as the bishop for Kericho diocese to replace Bishop Emmanuel Okombo who retired. He said the process of selecting and appointing a bishop was long and tedious, stressing that the Pope is always careful when appointing bishops to shepherd the faithful. (Edited by F'Orieny)
