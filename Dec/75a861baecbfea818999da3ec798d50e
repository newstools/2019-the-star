 Kenyans have been warned to beware of politics of deception. Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and leader of the majority in Parliament at the weekend echoed each other's views that a "cunning" Raila Odinga has all along been "deceitful" on among many other things his handshake with President Kenyatta. Lying and deception are the main ingredients politicians use as the means to justify the desired ends. Both Murkomen and Duale are diehard lieutenants of Deputy President William Ruto, their obvious presidential successor in 2022. To them, Raila has muddied the succession process with the handshake. Yet these selfsame politicians were not so long ago vocal in their support for the handshake. Duale, on June 23, stated: "We have no choice but to support Uhuru-Raila handshake." Six months later, he says the handshake has destroyed Jubilee’s internal political bridges, destabilised the party’s strongholds, undermined constitutional officeholders and sowed seeds of discord and confusion. Political deception is corrosive to good governance. In 2020 Kenyans will be bombarded with lies and deception from both the Ruto and Raila camps which will spare none of their enormous resources to succeed Uhuru. Yes, beware. The decibels of political deception will be high in 2020 and higher until the Uhuru successor is announced in 2022.
