The Nyeri county administration will fund the construction of Kiawara Level 4 Hospital next year, Governor Mutahi Kahiga has said. The hospital expected to serve residents of Kieni West Sub-county will cost Sh300 million. Already, consultation meetings have started among residents and leaders of Kiawara. “The hospital will ease access to healthcare services for local residents who usually travel for many kilometres in search of a medical facility,” Kahiga said. Some residents from the subcounty have been travelling for over 55 kilometres to Nyeri town to seek medical services. The hospital is also meant to ease congestion at the Nyeri County Referral Hospital. The national government has committed Sh30 million which will go towards the project, he said. The Ministry of Health allocated the Sh30 million to go towards the building of the hospital after the constituency purchased a 10-acre piece of land. “My government is ready to fund the project possibly from next year,” Kahiga said. The two subcounties of the vast Kieni constituency have had no Level 4 hospital and residents sought the services either in Nyeri town, Karatina Level 4 or in neighbouring Laikipia county. Further, the county government has started the construction of a Sh335 million Level 4 hospital in Kieni East Sub County. The project is being funded by the county government and the World Bank under the Kenya Devolution Support Programme. The facility in Narumoru town near the Nyeri – Nanyuki road will serve as a referral facility for Kieni East subcounty residents.
