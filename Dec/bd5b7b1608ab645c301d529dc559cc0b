Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has been rushed to the Kenyatta National Hospital for medical treatment. Sonko's communication director Elkana Jacob confirmed to the Star that the governor was taken to hospital on Monday at 9:45 pm from the Kamiti Maximum Prison where he was taken after the ruling. Milimani anti-corruption Magistrate Douglas Ogoti in his ruling on Monday said the governor can be allowed to seek medical attention while in remand. Sonko's lawyer Cecil Miller had told the court that the governor needs an urgent chest CT scan and has already been given drugs for pain. He added that Sonko has possible rib fractures as well after his arrest. "He needs medical attention with the possibility of admission. Sonko did not assault police officers, instead, he was the one who was assaulted," Miller said. The state did not oppose the release of the other accused persons on bail but urged the court to consider the amount of money involved. Ogoti directed Sonko to get medical treatment in the presence of prisons authorities. This was after Miller presented a letter from MP Shah Hospital signed by Dr Esther Nafula Wekesa showing that Sonko was examined at the facility. Sonko is said to have complained of chest pain following an assault on Friday evening. “The pain has been worsening with time and the patient is unable to lie down flat for examination. I recommend an urgent chest CT scan to rule out rib fractures and hospital admission for further evaluation,” read the letter. Sonko will appear again in court on Wednesday to know the fate of his bail application. The governor was arrested on Friday while in Voi and spend the weekend at the EACC headquarters. The city governor is facing charges alongside the other 16 suspects who misappropriated Sh350 million county funds.
