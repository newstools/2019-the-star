The National Transport and Safety Authority has lifted the suspension on Modern Coast's licence. In a tweet on Friday, head of communications Dido Guyatu said: The firm's licence had been suspended eight days ago after its two buses were involved in an accident, killing seven and injuring 62 people. "Following the early Thursday morning crash involving two of their buses, the Authority has with immediate effect suspended the Company's operator's licence and initiated a thorough investigation into its safety standards and operations," NTSA said in a statement. The authority deactivated the company's access to the NTSA portal to limit activities on their 88 vehicles. The National Police was also advised to impound any of their vehicles from operating contrary to this suspension. The accident involved two Modern Coast buses at Kiongwani area near Salama market along the Nairobi-Mombasa Highway on Thursday morning. Makueni county commander Joseph Napeiyan said the two buses headed in opposite directions collided head-on in the 2 am accident. One bus was headed to Mombasa from Malaba while the other was headed to Nairobi from Mombasa. A two-year-old baby is among those who lost their lives in the crash.
