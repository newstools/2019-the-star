Shock and confusion gripped Embu GK Prison on Friday after a capital offense prisoner hanged himself using his clothes allegedly following a quarrel with a colleague. Silas Kirimi Ntimwamba was reportedly found having hanged himself from the roof of the cell. He allegedly quarreled with another inmate over an unknown issue. The prison’s commander Henry Ochieng confirmed the incident that he said took place on Thursday night before the issue was reported in the morning. “He hanged himself with clothes last night. He was serving a life sentence,” said Ochieng on phone. Ochieng said the county crimes office was investigating the matter and he could not give further information on the issue. County police commander Daniel Rukunga said since it was not clear what really happened an inquest into the death had been started. Sources said Ntimwamba was always calm and that he was on medication for a sickness they could not disclose. Of late he lost his temper uncontrollably whenever he was wronged. The sources said the inmate was jailed by a Meru court and previously served his sentence from 2013 before he was transferred to Embu in 2016. The body of the prisoner was removed to the Embu Level Five Hospital mortuary.
