Deputy President William Ruto has mocked Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua's move to record a statement with the police over alleged threats by him. The DP on Sunday said all he did was give Mutua a firm handshake, adding that if his handshake was interpreted as being threatening, the governor may not be able to withstand the handshake of someone from Western region. "He ran to report me to the police. What if he had shook hands with someone from this region who has been stirring a pot? He may have run to the Hague," Ruto said. He spoke in Budalang'i during a sports event organised for the youth. Foreign Affairs CAS Ababu Namwamba was present. Mutua recorded a statement at the Kilimani police station last week, accusing Ruto of attacking him on December 11 at State House. The governor alleged Ruto shook hands with him and told him: "You have been attacking me and I have to crush you. I will teach you a lesson." He said the DP added, "You wait, you will see", in presence of National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale whom he said told him 'we warned you'. Duale dismissed Mutua's allegation, saying they were in different leagues. Ruto's close ally and Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen also dismissed Mutua's allegations, saying the governor does not deserve anybody's attention. Mutua has criticised Ruto for not backing BBI.
