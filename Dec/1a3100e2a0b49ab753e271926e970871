We will soon bid 2019 goodbye, the year many contend was very difficult, in part due to the shrinking buying power of the majority, exacerbated by maturing loans that gobble quite a huge part of our revenue and long-term projects whose economic benefits may take too long to realise. While the problems arising from the external factors may be hard to change, we must deal with the pilferage in the public section rather than spending a fortune to go after those who have misused or stolen the public resources. Prosecuting those who misuse their offices to rob the public is laudable, but their conviction will be key in instilling the much-needed discipline. Even more important will be looking at our laws, policies and regulations which seem to abet corruption and other economic crimes. This should be done with a view not to change them but to strengthen or fully implement them. We are yet to fully back accountability measures with practicable action plans. Cronyism, friendship, tribalism and nepotism still play great roles in securing potential employees any job in government institutions and departments. Such practices aid corruption as the people employed owe their allegiance first to the person who secured them the opportunities rather than to the citizens. They act as gatekeepers and are often ready to do as ordered by their bosses. But even in cases where people are competitively employed, in a country where securing a job is arduous and the juniors work at the behest of their corrupt seniors, the former are either inducted to this thieving bandwagon or are intimidated and finally sacked on trumped-up allegations when they try to resist. This relationship must be relooked.  Economic and political analyst
