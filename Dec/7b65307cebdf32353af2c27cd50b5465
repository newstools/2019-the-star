Deejays Kalonje and Juan will be performing at the Dubai 7s with dancehall artiste Konshens next Saturday. Stardome Entertainment Marketing Manager Brian Livity said in a statement, "We have been consistent in delivering our promise to fans over time. This year we'll take the bar higher with Konshens." Last year, Kenya was represented by Homeboyz Radio, G Money and ZJ Heno. DJ Juan will be making a second trip to the event this year.
