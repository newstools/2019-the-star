Nakuru county government says more than 2,000 families have been displaced by ongoing rains and floods, especially in Molo and Kuresoi areas. More than 90 families were displaced in Ndabibi area of Naivasha following heavy rains in Maella and Narok. The downpour was continuing. Chief officer in charge of disaster management Ann Njenga said the county was supplying needy families with food, shelter and basic supplies. She said that Molo and Kuresoi subcounties were the hardest-hit. Farms and homes were flooded, leaving tens of families homeless. “Since the rains began, over 2,000 families have been displaced, and we are putting measures in place to stop further losses," she said on Tuesday. Njenga noted rains had made it impossible to access some areas. “In some areas in Kuresoi, water is emanating from underground making it hard to control, but we are working with humanitarian organisations to assist the families," she said. In Kikopey Gilgil, the CO said road machinery was opening up clogged drainage systems and flooded fields. Maella MCA Kamanu Gathariki called the situation in Ndabibi very serious due to ngoing rains in the nearby hills. He said that the affected families, mainly from Huruma village, had been forced to seek shelter in the local primary school, even as water levels rise. Gathariki noted that the rains had cut off major roads in the ward. Jane Mureithi said their three-room house was submerged and the family had to flee in the middle of the night. (Edited by V. Graham)
