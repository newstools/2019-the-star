Youth leaders in Teso have urged the government to investigate a case in which an Administration Police officer was shot dead in Kiambu. The youth said the killers of Constable Daniel Etyang should be arrested and prosecuted. They called on DCI George Kinoti and DPP Noordin Haji to investigate the incident and bring the culprits to book. “It is heartbreaking that Daniel Etyang was shot 12 times. Common sense dictates that someone somewhere was after his life. As youth leaders, we cannot take the killing of our own lightly,” a statement read by Teso North ANC chairman Fredrick Epalat read. Etyang was gunned down on the night of November 23, in Ruaka, Kiambu. He was killed alongside taxi driver Galgalo Wako. The incident happened at Ruaka Court Yard Complex and a police report filed at Mururi police station indicated that Etyang was among suspected gangsters who were planning to carry out a robbery on two Nigerians living at Ruaka Court Yard. The report also said police officers who killed the two recovered a pistol with 10 bullets and the car registration number KCU 926L at the incident scene. Two days after the killing, Etyang's colleagues demanded to know why a cop they described as disciplined and friendly had to die at the hands of fellow police officers. The slain AP Constable, who comes from Kakapel village in Teso North subcounty is claimed to have been ordered by his shooters to surrender but instead fired a bullet, prompting a shoot-out. “Kiambaa officers acting on a tip-off that there was robbery with violence incident that was to take place at Ruaka Court Yard Building Complex in a house resided by two Nigerian nationals, officers intercepted the robbers just within the compound of the said complex as they were taking position,” the police report said. “Upon being challenged to surrender, they started shooting at the officers.” Etyang will be buried on Thursday.
