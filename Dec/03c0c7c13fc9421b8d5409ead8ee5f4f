​The national men's handball team's training ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics Africa qualifiers has been hit hard by persistent heavy rains pounding the Kaloleni Sports Grounds, Nairobi. The outfit is preparing for the Olympics Africa qualifiers set for Tunis, Tunisia between January 12 and 18.  The team started their training last Thursday and has had to contend with the rains. Head coach Peter Mwathi intimated that if the rains persist, they may have to opt for Nyayo Stadium basketball gymnasium, which he described as sub-standard. "We have had meaningful engagements between Thursday and Saturday and we hope to take it a notch higher today (yesterday). The first three days were for laying the foundation of our road to Tunisia. It was about letting everyone know what is required of them as we forge forward," noted Mwathi who wants the team to move to the Nyayo handball court before the end of the week. "We should be moving to Nyayo before the end of the week but if the rains persist, we will be forced to at least request for the basketball gymnasium or better still to Kasarani Indoor Arena. "There's not much we can do at Basketball gymnasium because it is not full size for handball but better little than nothing," the tactician added.
