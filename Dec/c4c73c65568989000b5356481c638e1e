The county government of Kisumu has threatened to declare positions of striking doctors vacant if they fail to report back to work by close of business on Monday. About 250 health workers downed their tools on December 6 over failure of the county government to effect their promotions as agreed in the 2017 Collective Bargaining Agreement. Health executive Judy Atyang said the county had assured the medics that their promotions were being worked on but they ignored the promised and proceeded on strike. She said promotion letters were written by December 19 and the workers asked to collect them resume work. Only three have since been collected. On Friday, the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union Kisumu branch officials rallied their members to reject the letters. Nyanza region KMPDU chairman Kevin Osuri described the offers as ‘love letters’ saying they were not a reflection of what was agreed on in the CBA. The doctors, he said, will carry on with the strike until the 2017 CBA is fully implemented. But Atyang insisted the letters were prepared by the County Public Service Board in line with the doctor’s scheme of service. Speaking in her office on Monday, Atyang said the doctors had up to 5 pm on Monday to collect the letters, failing which the positions will be declared vacant. “The county government has a specific template for doing promotion letters so how can they refer to them as love letters yet they have not collected or looked at the contents?” she asked. The County Government, she said has implemented 95 per cent of the CBA with the promotions being the only issue pending. She attributed the slow implementation of the doctor’s promotions to a delay in release of funds from the National Treasury.  edited by p.o
