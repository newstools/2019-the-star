Kenya face hosts Uganda today in a-must-win game to stand a chance of advancing from the Zonal Beach Volleyball Olympic qualifiers at the Lido Beach in Entebbe. Kenya found themselves in a tricky position after losing the golden set 12-15 to Tanzania yesterday. Coach Sammy Mulinge acknowledged that chasing the scores from behind was a daunting task for the experienced duo of Ibrahim Oduor and James Mwaniki to face Tanzania’s David Neeke and Ford Edward in the tie breaker. “The boys allowed the Tanzanian team to advance in scores in this short set and struggling from behind against a very physically fit side was tough. Their blocks did not materialise and movement  in the back cost us the set and the game altogether,” said Mulinge. “We still have a 50:50 chances of qualifying but only if we beat Uganda tomorrow (today).  We have to change the strategy and make sure we advance on score ratio,” added the tactician. The Kenyan Two pair comprising General Service Unit’s Cornelius Kiplagat and Brian Melly went down to Tanzanian duo of David Neeke and Ford Edward in the first games in straight sets of 18-21,19-21. Kenya One partnership of Oduor and Mwaniki shook off their compatriots’ defeat and hammered Tanzania Two- Said Alhaj and Shukuru Ally— 2-0 (21-13,21-10) to force the game into the golden set decider. Both pairs opened their campaigns on winning note by beating Sudan teams. Kiplagat and Melly beat Sudanese duo of Muzamil Ateya and Mohammed Hamad 2-1 (21-17, 15-21, 18-16) while Oduor and Mwaniki pinned down the pair of Nagi Osman and Bar Eldin Momen in straight sets of 21-15, 22-20. Today, Kenya come face-to-face with hosts Uganda where Emmanuel Elanyu is partnering with Amon Ainebyona and Mark Okurut teaming up with Emma Kato. Tanzania remain unbeaten and lock horns with Sudan today. They have beaten both Kenya and Uganda on the golden set.
