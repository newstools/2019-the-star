Police are investigating an ugly incident in which people living with disabilities in Likuyani subcounty in Kakamega were given wrapped stones instead of sewing machines. Police were yesterday trying to establish how the sewing machines donated by the National Fund for the Disabled (NFD-K) disappeared from the Likuyani deputy county commissioner Wilson Kimaiyo's office and replaced them with stones. Kimaiyo admitted that the machines had been kept in his office. He said he had handed the matter over to the Likuyani DCI for investigation. "We want thorough investigations carried out and those involved brought to book because they must have been in office," he said. Kakamega county police commander Bernard Muli yesterday held a meeting with departmental heads at the Likuyani subcounty headquarters over the incident. Likuyani persons living with disabilities chairman Moses Nanjukhi said the machines were delivered more than a month ago. He said most of the applicants received theirs directly from the fund and three who were not present had theirs kept at the deputy county commissioner's office. Nanjukhi wondered how the sewing machines were replaced with stones in a government office. There was no break-in reported by the office. When the three applicants came for collection on Thursday, they were handed well-packaged cartons which they assumed were sewing machines and other tools they had applied for, but they were shocked when they reached home and opened them only to find packed stones. "It’s so disheartening for someone to steal items meant to help the disabled. These people applied for the machines, so they can improve their livelihoods by engaging in income-generating activities,” Nanjukhi said. NFD-K CEO Alex Mutegi yesterday said the matter is being handled at the DCC’s office. “What was affected is what we left at the Likuyani DCC office and that can be addressed as such,” he said on the phone.
