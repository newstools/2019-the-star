Tourism stakeholders at the south Coast have reported an 80 per cent increase in tourism in the area. The stakeholders attributed this to the lowering of accommodation rates for local tourists. Led by chairman Ali Nyoka, the stakeholders, including hoteliers, beach operators and tour guides, said hotels are receiving massive bookings with many tourists being domestic. Nyoka said December usually records poor tourism business but due to reduced hotel tariffs the season is still at its peak. "During this time of the year, few tourists are spotted in the beaches because majority of the foreigners fly back to their countries to spend Christmas with their families,‚Äù he said. Nyoka said the sector is expected to boom to early January. He was spoke on Wednesday at Neptune beach in Diani, Kwale county. He said hotels have had advance bookings which indicates that many people will stay longer for Christmas and New Year. "We anticipate more visitors because many are planning to celebrate the remaining important holidays at the Coast," he said. Meanwhile, Nyoka decried the increase of beach boys who have become a threat to the tourism industry. He asked security apparatus to intervene and remove them from the beaches. He said beach boys have been operating illegally and are usually involved in theft. "Tourists are complaining that they are being robbed while at the beaches," Nyoka said. He said if action is not taken, there is a high possibility that tourism would decline at the south Coast. Kwale county police commander Joseph Nthenge said security measures are already in place and that seashores are safe. Nthenge asked hoteliers, especially those who will do fireworks while marking the New Year, to strictly follow rules and regulations. He said criminals may take advantage of the fireworks to rob people at gunpoint. He asked both tourists and locals to remain vigilant and report any insecurity cases.
