Meru University of Science and Technology ViceChancellor Prof Romanus Odhiambo has dismissed lecturers who have issued a notice for a go-slow and petitioned the institution over alleged mismanagement and high-handedness. “We are looking to be a powerhouse in research training and innovation and be a centre of excellence. I urge the council, staff, stakeholders, students and Senate to help us work towards achieving this noble goal,” Odhiambo said. He spoke during the university's seventh graduation ceremony where more than 1,200 learners were certified. The institution's tutors organising secretary Victor Mugambi said they were airing their grievances on promotions, lack of annual increment, internal appointment and lack of allowances. He said the management was withholding research money and condemned the treatment of lecturers at the institution. The VC opposed claims by a number of lecturers that he failed to honour his pledge to fund research. He was silent on promotions. He said there have been many research projects that have kept the university on top of others in the area. “The core business of a university is quality education, training and research. The university is leading. We have several groundbreaking research projects aimed at meeting the Big Four agenda," Odhiambo said. He cited a sensor-based irrigation system and innovations on climate-smart agriculture and technology. On manufacturing, he said, students had been trained on computer assembling, programming and software installation. He said the institution is also continuing to allocate funds for supporting internal researchers. Edited by R.Wamochie
