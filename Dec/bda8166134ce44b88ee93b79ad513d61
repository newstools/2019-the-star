A superb second-half header by Matt Doherty cancelled out an early goal by Lys Mousset as Wolverhampton Wanderers came from behind to draw 1-1 at home to Sheffield United on Sunday, extending their unbeaten Premier League run to nine games. The crowd at Molineux had barely taken their seats when Mousset struck after 62 seconds, taking a touch to control the ball in the box before slamming it home to put the visitors ahead. Despite creating a number of decent chances, the home team looked all at sea for much of the first hour until Doherty met a Raul Jimenez cross with a powerful header to put them level in the 64th minute. Doherty celebrated the goal with an emotional tribute to the two-year-old daughter of former Wolves striker Benik Afobe who died on Friday, removing the black armband being worn in her honour and kissing it before holding it up to the sky. The goal prompted a sustained period of pressure from Wolves but Sheffield United showed why they are unbeaten away from home this season with a tenacious defensive display as they hung on for the draw. “We defended badly in the first situation but we stayed in the game and competed until the end,” Wolves coach Nuno Espirito Santo told reporters, adding that goal-scorer Doherty was going to visit the grieving Afobe after the game. Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder was disappointed with how his side conceded but pleased with the performance against a sixth-placed Wolves side who are one point ahead of them in the table on 20 points after 14 games. “We knew they’d fight back after we went ahead because of the fight they have as a team. This is always a tough place to come so I’m delighted we’ve kept our away record going,” he said.
