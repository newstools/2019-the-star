President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga are usually among prominent politicians who send Christmas messages to Kenyans. This year however, the President did not send seasonâ€™s greetings jointly with the Deputy President as has been the case in the past years. The Christmas card also did not feature an image of the President with the Deputy President side by side. Could a frosty relationship between the two leaders be the reason why they each sent Christmas greetings separately. *** Those who had gone out of Nairobi for the Christmas festivities might be in for a rude shock when they return to the city. Garbage in the city has not been collected for a week now and every corner including, some parts of the Central Business District are nothing but heaps of filthy garbage. One wonders if those who are required to ensure the city remains clean all took a break to celebrate Christmas or if the current leadership crisis at County Hall is to blame. *** Authorities in Mombasa are on the spot yet again over the way they handled the case where eight fishermen were stranded in the ocean for 18 days. A resident told Corridors that officers patrolling the ocean came across the stranded fishermen on the ninth day but they left them without offering any assistance. The fishermen were only rescued after another nine days adrift after surviving on fish alone for almost three weeks. *** An MP from western who has been having it rough at his constituency opted to spend his festivities in Nairobi for fear of coming face-to-face with his voters. A voter from his constituency whispered to Corridors that the MP chose to remain in the city after learning that people in his village had planned to put him to task over various development projects he had initiated and the pledges he made during campaigns. The villagers are said to have vowed to keep waiting knowing very well that sooner or later he will come home and face them.
