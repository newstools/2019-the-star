Mombasa Catholic Archbishop Martin Kivuva has thrown his weight behind the Building Bridges Initiative, saying it will steer the country on the path of reconciliation and lasting unity. Kivuva, who graced a cultural event organised by Kiembeni Holy Family Catholic Church on Sunday, said the BBI will solve many of Kenya’s political and socio-economic development of the country. “For example, it contains recommendations on how to strengthen devolution which will spread development across the country,” he said. The BBI proposes an increase in county allocation to 45 per cent of the GDP up, from the current 15 per cent. Kivuva said this is an important step in strengthening devolution. The Archbishop said the devolved units in the counties may not benefit Kenyans in the long run if there is no significant increase in funding. He urged Kenyans to read, understand and support the initiative. The BBI report was released about two weeks ago. President Uhuru and Opposition chief Raila Odinga have also urged Kenyans to read and understand the document and delink it with the 2022 succession politics. Deputy President William Ruto and his allies have made an about-turn and now say they support the BBI, after months of criticising the initiative. Kivuva on Sunday said peace-loving Kenyans would appreciate that the BBI means well for Kenya. “It contains some important recommendations that if implemented will see Kenya become a better place even after elections,” he said. He said the initiative would end chaos, violence and division that characterise the country during electioneering periods. The cleric noted that the BBI report seeks to cure the winner-takes-all culture after a presidential election, saying the system has been the root cause of Kenya’s electoral problems. The Archbishop said the initiative seeks to fight endemic corruption, which he said is at the heart of the problems facing the country.
