The Kenya Revenue Authority has urged policymakers to embrace research and use findings to forge decisions that will enable the country realize its fiscal targets. KRA commissioner Fred Mugambi said research should be well done adding that findings should not end up in shelves but rather be used as the baseline for making public decisions. “Researches are used to explain situations like trends in economic growth and G.D.P ratios, prove theories and find solutions to problems like illicit financial flows,” he said. Mugambi added that the major roadblocks to research in Africa are poor funding, alignment and sequencing of research to Africa’s problems and failure to utilize findings in public decision-making. He spoke during the opening of the 2nd Kenya School of Revenue Administration Conference at the Kenya School of Monetary Studies that brought together revenue administrators, policymakers, researchers and scholars from various African countries.
