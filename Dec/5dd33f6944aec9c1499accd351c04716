Kiambu teachers do not recognise a January strike notice issued by Kenya National Union of Teachers secretary general Wilson Sossion, a branch official has said. On December 1, while in Mombasa, Sossion gave the government a 22-day ultimatum to meet teacher's long term agreements failure which they will down their tools. But Kiambu West Knut assistant branch secretary Stephen Ngotho said they do not recognise him as the union boss, hence he cannot address issues regarding teachers in the country. Ngotho said the outstanding issues between the teachers and the government can be addressed by Knut without Sossion. "We know Sossion as a legislator who is a teacher by profession and a one-time leader of our union. This is is the time he should leave the union alone so that he retains the respect he has earned," Ngotho said. Ngotho spoke on Saturday in Lari during a graduation party for the daughter of branch executive secretary Michael Muna. Ngotho and Muchiri said they support the delocalisation of teachers but advised the TSC to put into consideration the age and health condition of those to be affected. "At times you transfer a teacher who will retire after one year too far. Teachers who have chronic diseases need to be near their homes. The two groups do not need to be taken outside their home subcounty," Muhiri said. Ngotho also asked the government to reconsider employing intern teachers, since the salaries they will be earning is too little and it was likely to demoralise them as it supports the teaching fraternity in this country. "We have a shortage of teachers in this country. The government should not be thinking of hiring interns, but it should come up with a strategy for employing more teachers," Ngotho said. Ngotho also asked the government to employ more tutors at Technical and Vocational Education Training Institutions since they absorb many students to take artisanal courses.
