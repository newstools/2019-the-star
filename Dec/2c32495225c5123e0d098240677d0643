Naivasha residents are reeling from torrents of torment after the main road passing through the region was left in ruins. The transport crisis on Moi South Lake road has been massive and has thrown hoteliers, traders and flower farmers off balance. They have to use alternative routes and that increases the cost of business. Matatu operators using the road have threatened to stop paying levies to national and county governments until it is repaired. A contractor is on-site but cannot begin works as downpours have left sections flooded. In a statement, Naivasha MP Jane Kihara, who had called for its rehabilitation, yesterday said the contractor cannot work because of heavy rains. John Okoth, a manager with one of the farms, said the road has become an eyesore and a source of pain to residents and motorists. He said every year the government collects millions of shillings in revenue from farmers, hoteliers and private companies along the road. "We are deeply disturbed by the deteriorating status of the road and we have now been forced to seek alternative routes for our trucks, meaning more losses." Samuel Kinyua, a matatu operator, said they have suffered as they wait for the government to keep its promise of repairing the road. They incur huge losses daily and have had to double fares. "We had been promised that the road would be recarpeted two months ago but this has not been fulfilled and we don’t have an option but to go back to the streets," he said. Lake View MCA Karanja Mburu said they deserve better and criticised the government for delaying to repair the road — a key contributor to the transport sector, which boosts livelihoods and revenue for residents and the government. Nearly all flower farms, hotels and government agencies used the road for their day-to-day operations and the best option is to tarmac it, he said. (Edited by F'Orieny)
