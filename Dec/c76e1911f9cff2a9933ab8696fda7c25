Nairobi is set to host an Eastern Africa regional meeting to discuss human trafficking and migration in January. Organisers of the meeting hope to harmonise policies on free movement, which experts believe is one of the factors fuelling human trafficking as a transnational crime in East and Horn of Africa region. Senior Deputy Secretary in the Labour ministry Joyce Mwale says that states in the region are perceived to be a source, transit point and destination for persons being trafficked and smuggled. Speaking during a preparatory meeting for the forum, Mwale said the free movement of people in the region is directly linked to the trafficking problem but it is "less frequently talked about." "Proper management of labour migration, therefore, remains an important aspect of mitigating against trafficking,” Mwale said. The forum will bring together ministries in-charge of labour migration and social protection in Burundi, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. Under Secretary in the Social Protection Department Fatma Ahmed said that the region is faced with challenges of human trafficking and smuggling of migrant workers, whose rights are widely abused. There is a need to establish a labour market information system on migration, diaspora engagement and bilateral labour arrangements in order to address these challenges, she said. The conference is organised by the Ministry of Labour in partnership with the International Organization for Migration. “We hope to share data and information on trends; priorities; needs, and interests of member states to foster safe and orderly labour mobility within Africa,” Ahmed said. The International Migration Report 2017 shows that over 47 per cent of the African population is increasingly migrating outside the continent. Further, it is estimated that on average 50 per cent of them are youth, predominantly male, of an average age of 25 years old and 46.8 per cent are female.
