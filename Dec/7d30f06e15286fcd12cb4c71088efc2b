Runaway cheating culture ranging from negative ethnicity, love triangles, polls irregularities, tax evasion, corruption, embezzlement of public funds, empty rhetorics and promises, fake certificates, swearing-in God’s name are some of the common cheating areas. So, is cheating culture coming part and parcel of our lives? For how long will the centre hold and with what eventualities? The Kenya National Examinations Council cancelled results of 1,309 candidates who were involved in cheating Education CS George Magoha, while releasing the 2019 KCSE results said cases of examination irregularities had reduced drastically compared to 4,519 cases recorded last year to reflect a 71 per cent drop. “If anybody has been guilty, it is we the parents that have been guilty in this process. We confuse the children but I want to put it to you that this year we confused the children a bit less so they did better.” [That was meant for who mislead the children by engaging them in cheating] The students involved were found with mobile phones and other unauthorised materials. A total of 667,222 candidates sat this year’s KCSE exam. To curb exam cheating, the government is dealing with cartels in the sector, and also insist parents to candidates won’t be spared. This raises a pertinent question. How does the parent directly get involved? Its  never too late to sober up and bury and strongly condemn all forms and practices of cheating and  uphold and restore lost confidence. Let's unite in fighting all sorts of cheating.
