 Busia bus park traders have threatened not to pay rates to the county government from next month if it does not improve the drainage system and collect raw waste littering the area. The traders and matatu operators on Thursday said their health and that of their clients is at risk. They complained that the county government continues to collect revenue from them without providing critical services. “We are paying a lot of revenue on a daily basis but the county government has failed in service delivery. Raw waste is spread everywhere and the bus park itself is also flooded due to poor drainage system,” Busia Business Owners Association chairman Steve Obala told the Star. The traders, matatu operators and the public also threatened to plant bananas in the flooded bus park if the county government does not rehabilitate it. Obala said: “The county government should move with speed and collect the raw waste and rehabilitate the bus park which is in a pathetic condition. It is flooded.” He said the county government had until the end of this month to rid the park of raw waste, correct the drainage system or else "we will stop paying revenue by January 2020”.
