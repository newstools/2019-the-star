 The Garissa government in collaboration with Red Cross, UNICEF and the national government, has started distributing food and non-food aid to flood victims who were displaced after River Tana burst its banks last week. More than 1,000 families from Bula Punda, Bula Iftin, Bouralgy, Bula Sheikh and Windsor are camping in seven IDP camps after their homes were submerged. Most are camping at Hyuga Primary School, Young Muslim, Kazuku, NEP Technical Institute and along the road. Garissa county commissioner Meru Mwangi said the delay in disbursing humanitarian aid was occasioned by the enlisting of the victims. He said "fake victims" benefited from aid at the expense of those affected in 2017. “We didn’t want to repeat the mistake that happened in 2017. It's unfortunate that some greedy individuals are taking advantage of other people's misfortunes,” Mwangi said. Garissa Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane who witnessed the distribution of aid at Young Muslim camp on Sunday. He asked residents still living in lowlands to move to higher grounds to avert disaster, saying water levels were expected to rise. Dagane urged the national government to airlift relief food and non-food items to flood victims in Hulugho, Liboi, Amuma, Galmagalla and Sangailu that have been cut off due to heavy rains.  edited by p .obuya
