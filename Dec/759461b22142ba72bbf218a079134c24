A man charged with defiling a girl has been granted Sh300,000 bond. Emmanuel Kilaka lured the minor to his house from her aunt’s place. On Wednesday, Kilaka appeared before Kibera senior principal magistrate Boaz Ombewa. He pleaded not guilty. He allegedly committed the offence between November 12 and December 6 on Kawangware estate, Nairobi. He was also charged with indecently touching her. A police report presented in court read that he also threatened to attack the girl’s mother with a knife before residents intervened. The mother reported to the police after her daughter failed to return home. The girl went back home on November 19 and was taken to Nairobi Women’s Hospital upon the advice of the police. She ran away from the hospital and went back to Kilaka’s house, leaving her mother at the facility. Residents mounted a search and the girl and the accused were arrested. Kilaka was escorted to Muthangari police station. He was arraigned on Wednesday. The girl was taken back to the hospital. Kilaka appealed for lenient bond terms and was granted Sh300,000 bond with a surety of the same amount. The case will be mentioned on December 23 and heard on February 17.
