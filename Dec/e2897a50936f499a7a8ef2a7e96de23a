 Lamu Governor Fahim Twaha has called for the hanging of terrorists and their sympathisers upon conviction. While addressing a public baraza at Kiangwe on Monday, Twaha called for the reintroduction of the death penalty to deter militant crimes including terrorist activities. Lamu has borne the brunt of terror attacks since 2012 with hundreds of civilians and police officers killed. The worst attack happened between 2014 and 2015 when militants killed over 100 people in Mpeketoni, Hindi, Witu and Kibaoni areas. Twaha said it was painful that innocent people lost their lives at the merciless hands of the terrorists. He said al Shaabab militants and their sympathisers should be dealt with mercilessly to serve as deterrence for others who wish to join extremist groups. “They are so merciless and have killed many innocent people. It’s high time they are also met with equally merciless treatment. They are cold-blooded murderers and deserve to be dealt with exactly the way they do to others or even worse. They don’t deserve to live among normal people. Let the government bring back the death penalty so that al Shabaab can be a thing of the past,” Twaha said. The governor lauded the ongoing Linda Boni multi-agency security operation which he said had greatly restored peace and stability in Lamu after a spate of terror attacks. He said the peace being witnessed in Lamu had greatly boosted the confidence of tourists and that various state projects like the LAPSSET were an indication of the security in the region. Twaha urged investors to come to Lamu saying they will not regret it. He called on residents to continue cooperating with security officers by reporting any suspicious persons or activities. "The government has made major strides to secure Lamu from terrorism and as leaders, we are glad. That's why we are calling on investors and tourists to come and experience Lamu. The security department hasn’t failed us and we say thank you,” Twaha said.  edited by peter obuya
