Shujaa inched closer to the main cup quarterfinals of the Cape Town sevens on Saturday with a hard-fought 12-7 win over Australia. Kenya started the match brightly dominating possession and it came as no surprise when Vincent Onyala crossed the whitewash with Daniel Taabu kicking over the conversion for a 7-0 lead. The Aussies regrouped and a lapse in concentration by Shujaa saw Harry Hutchinson touch down Lewis Holland adding the extras to tie the match at 7-7 at the interval. On resumption Alvin "Buffa" Otieno crashed over the line for unconverted try. Kenya then had to repel the Aussies for the reminder of the match and secure a crucial victory. Kenya will play Ireland in its final pool match at 5:47pm on Saturday.
