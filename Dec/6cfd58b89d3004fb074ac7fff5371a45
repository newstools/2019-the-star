At least 41 street boys in Isiolo town have successfully underwent a rite of passage into adulthood, courtesy of support from the Isiolo business community and other well-wishers. The boys, who are aged between ten and 16 years, have been in seclusion for three weeks where they received counselling from religious leaders. Speaking during their pass out ceremony at Bula Mpya Primary School, Dr Mohamud Abdikadir, who has been circumcising street boys for free for eight years now, said that there was need for the Isiolo community to rethink where the now circumcised boys will go after making the important step. “The rite of passage will have no impact if they were to go back to the streets where drugs are the order of the day,” Abdikadir said. He said with support from the office of the county commissioner, some of the kids will be absorbed in various children's homes, where they are expected to attend school. Dr Mohamud lauded the Isiolo business community and the county commissioner’s office for offering food and non-food items for the boys. He noted that street kids were not enrolled in the Universal Health Coverage programme being piloted in Isiolo and three other counties.
