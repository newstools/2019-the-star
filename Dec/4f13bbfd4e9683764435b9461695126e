Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology head coach Daniel Irungu has cautioned his players against complacency ahead ofÂ  their three Kenya Handball Federation fixtures this weekend. This comes barely a day after their narrow (35-33) loss to military side Nanyuki in a match they blew away a five-point lead at the break. Lying in position 14 in the 25-team league, JKUAT are scheduled to meet Thika, another Kenya Defence Forces' outfit, reigning champions and third placed National Cereals and Produce Board today. Tomorrow, Irungu's charges will entertain bottom of the table teenage lineup Kaluluini in their last match of the year. "We cannot play the same way the boys did yesterday (Thursday). They just lost concentration in the dying minutes of the game," noted Irungu. The tactician admitted that NCPB pose the biggest threat but exuded confidence that they are up to the challenge. He is not ruling out burnout in his camp especially for the Sunday duel which will be the team's fourth league tie in four days.
