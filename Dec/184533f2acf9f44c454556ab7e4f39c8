Vocalist and singer Ivlyn Mutua officially launched her Christmas album titled 12 Beats of Christmas at the Alchemist Bar at the weekend. Entry was free to the launch that was sponsored by Kiss FM and Songa Music. “As an artist, my aim is to impact with my music. Music that people can directly relate [with] both emotionally and through the struggles of life,” she said in a past interview with Word Is “The album is on Songa and every song is different and it talks to different people. The way we’ve arranged the album, it goes from party mood all the way to Christmas.” She was joined by H_art The Band, Petra, Meryl Paige, Alysha Popat and gospel artist Dafari. Her album comes months after she switched from singing gospel songs to secular music. “Some were calling me a devil worshipper, saying I have backslid. But I’m taking my time for people to understand that nothing can separate me from Jesus,” the artist said.
