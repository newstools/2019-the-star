Before he started dating Kenyan entrepreneur Anerlisa Muigai, Tanzanian singer Ben Pol was dating a comedian from his country by the name Ebitoke. Speaking to Wasafi Media on Tuesday, Ebitoke said she was the one who seduced Ben Pol. "Men have a bad habit of making women think that you love them, yet it's not the case," she said. "A man comes to me and shows me love like he loves and wants me and I'm like, 'Thank you, God; you've brought me a man.' And then I give you my heart but at the end of the day, we are not together." She said she is now pregnant for her new beau.
