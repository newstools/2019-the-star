The Kenya Hockey Union have been challenged to expose players to international friendlies and high-performance levels to improve their  world ranking. A new world ranking system will be introduced on January 1, 2020, and Kenya will have to align itself with it. According to International Hockey Federation (IHF), the new ranking system is a more dynamic match-based method and is being introduced  after 12 months of research, analysis and testing. The world rankings system will be similar to the ones being used in rugby unions and association football.  The previous world ranking system has been used since 2003 and was originally devised to locate teams into pools at tournaments. Kenya are ranked 48th in the world with their best position having been 37 in July 2017. Coach Meshack Senge said the only way Kenya can be considered as a giant in the sport is through test matches with continental and world best teams. He said KHU should put the national team firmly in their program next year to avoid stagnation. Australia are the top-ranked team worldwide. Current world-ranking places will not be affected by the change and each nation will begin 2020 in their respective 2019 ranking position and points.
