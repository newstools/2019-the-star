Parents and religious leaders have been asked to sensitize and mobilize the youth to attend public meetings to get vital government information. Speaking at Mikinduri in Tigania Central subcounty Friday, area deputy county commissioner Obed Mose said barazas were meant to inform the public on government plans and resources allocated to community development projects. Mose said residents were expected to take advantage of public meetings as avenues of participating and contributing in identifying development priorities to enable them benefit from available government funds. In so doing, they would own the projects. “If everybody formed the habit of attending such meetings, nobody would feel left out of government interventions in relation to community empowerment and improved livelihoods,” the administrator said. He also cautioned residents against overindulging in merrymaking activities during Christmas and New Year celebrations at the expense of important matters such as providing school fees for their children in January. Mose said security agencies expected maximum cooperation and support from residents to ensure everybody was safe from crime during the festive period. He further reiterated the government’s commitment to ensure no girl was subjected to FGM in the subcounty, which is known for practicing the procedure long after many parts of the country had abandoned it.
