Ninety passengers on Wednesday morning were stranded at Sultan Hamud police station in Makueni after police impounded two Modern Coast buses. The National Transport and Safety Authority last week suspended the licence of the Modern Coast Bus Express Limited after two buses belonging to the company were involved in an accident. Seven people died in the accident on the Nairobi –Mombasa highway. Makueni county police commander Joseph Napeiyan said the buses ferrying passengers from Mombasa to Kakamega and Migori were intercepted at 3.30am on the same highway. “Each of the buses had 45 passengers on board when traffic police officers intercepted them at Sultan Hamud market. The vehicles are at the police station,”  Napeiyan said. The buses' crew fled, leaving passengers stranded. Most of the passengers were travelling upcountry for Christmas festivities. “We are wondering why the vehicle was impounded after being allowed all the way from Mombasa to Makueni,” asked Rodgers, a welder in Mombasa town, who was travelling with his wife and two children to Migori. He said he had no money to book another bus. Traveller Jackline Mwele claimed she had sought to be refunded her Sh3,000 ticket at the Modern Coast bus offices in Mombasa town, but she was informed that the ban had been lifted and her date of travel had not changed. "I got a text message on my phone saying the ban against Modern Coast had been lifted," she said. Mwele said they were picked at Mwembe Tayari in the evening, but were briefly held after a report that the ban was still active. “Shortly we were informed that the buses had been allowed to operate, and we proceeded with our journey until the vehicle was impounded at Sultan Hamud,” she said. There was confusion on Tuesday after Modern Coast company announced that NTSA had lifted the ban and allowed buses back on the road. But NTSA denied the claims, saying the ban was active.
