United States' Sevens rugby team is keen to play in next year's Safari Sevens tournament. Speaking yesterday, head coach Mike Friday said if they receive the invite early.  they will send a full-strength squad to Africa's Premier Sevens tournament. "If we get the invite early, then we will come and play. It's a wonderful tournament and its good preparation for the start of the World Seven Series in Dubai in December,” added Friday. Friday said he is delighted to see the senior players back for the Kenya Sevens team for the 2019-2020 season after missing out last season due to a contractual dispute between them and the union. "I'm happy they are back. They bring wealth of experience and make Kenya competitive at the world stage. I believe the younger players will learn immensely from them,” he added. The former England coach expressed confidence that Shujaa will be a force to reckon on the world stage this season. "You saw what they did in Cape Town last weekend. The physicality, speed, skill and commitment was there for all to see and I think they will be tough to beat come this season,” he noted. Friday, who was in the country at the request of the Rugby Patrons Society, conducted an age-grade clinic at the RFUEA ground with 60 children from Embulbul, Round, Arise, Kibera and other areas of the city. Friday said the age-grade  program was key in nurturing the next generation of talent as well as imparting life skills. "I spent the morning with teachers of various schools around Nairobi—sharing a bit of rugby knowledge, exchanging ideas and considering things that hopefully will allow young Kenyans to one day play at the World Sevens Series," said Friday. Friday coached Kenya during the 2012-2013 season guiding them to a fifth place finish—their highest ever with 99 points and guiding them to the Rugby World Cup Sevens semifinal in Russia.
