Police have been allowed to detain a suspect who allegedly caused the death of a woman after a botched abortion A Nairobi court ordered that Fred Orimba be held for seven days at Ruaraka police station pending investigations. In an affidavit before a Makadara law court, investigating officer Japheth Muthini stated that on December 10, the accused person while performing an abortion at a clinic in Kariadudu estate in Ruaraka, Nairobi, caused the death of 41-year-old Mary Wanjiku Mbugua. It was reported that the sister to the deceased, Tabitha Wanjiru Mbugua, made a report at Ruaraka police station after she visited her sister at the clinic on the morning of December 10 and found her dead. The court heard that Tabitha had told the officers the sister, who was three months pregnant, had sought medication at Carol Medical Clinic on December 9, but on 10 when she visited her at the clinic she found heavy blood on her bed. “Your honour, I am currently investigating a murder case. The sister to the deceased reported that when she visited her sister the following day she found heavy blood on the bed and her lifeless, cold body lying on it,” Muthini said. The offices who visited the scene suspected abortion, after which they arrested Orimba who is the owner and operator at the clinic. Orimba, 47, is also suspected to have been operating the clinic without a valid license. Muthini asked the court to be given time as he was yet to receive medical reports and witness statements to complete investigations.
