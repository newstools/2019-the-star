Police in Narok West on Friday rescued a 12-year-old girl from a planned marriage to an elderly man. Narok county commissioner Samuel Kimiti said police collaborated with the area chief to rescue the minor following a tip-off from the community members. “The girl was rescued on the eve of her wedding day. She was to get married to a man who is the agemate of her father as a second wife,” Kimiti said. Kimiti said that the girl is in the custody of the Narok Children’s Office as her suitor Kerima Nginai and her father who had planned her marriage are in police custody. The county commissioner said his administration is on high alert to avert such incidents that were compromising education in the area. “The government has provided free education to all children in the country so that no one can say he or she is disadvantaged. Any parent who will not take their children to school will face the full force of the law,” he said. He said that the two conspirators (girl’s father and suitor) would be arraigned in on Monday and charged with organising to marry off a minor. Kimiti reminded residents of the government’s plan to see 100 per cent transition to secondary school. “It does not matter the child’s background or the marks she or he scored. As long as the child sat for the KCPE exam, he or she should be enrolled to join secondary school,” Kimiti said.
