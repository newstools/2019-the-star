The Busia county Muslim Education Council has appealed to members and leaders of the religious community to join hands and set up secondary schools. Sadat Kibira, who is a representative of the council and a member of Busia County Education Board, said Muslim-sponsored schools will offer Islamic Religious Education and Arabic language, bearing in mind that the new  Competency Based Curriculum allows the teaching of foreign languages. Kibira expressed concern that in the entire Busia county does not have a single Muslim-sponsored secondary school. Many secondary schools are sponsored by the Catholic and Anglican churches. He addressed parents and other guests during the madrasa closing ceremony in Port Victoria town on Sunday. "So, we are very much disadvantaged because we do not have any Muslim sponsored secondary school in Busia county," he said. "Consequently, no secondary school in Busia county is offering Islamic Religious Education as a subject, nor do we have any secondary school in the county offering Arabic." He should the government advertise the positions of IRE and Arabic teachers, Muslim students will not be able to get those chances. For one to be employed by the TSC as an IRE teacher, the applicant must have done the subject in KCSE and scored at least a C+. Kibira said, in contrast, the Muslim community in Kakamega had set up more than 18  secondary schools.
