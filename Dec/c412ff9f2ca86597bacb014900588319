Voter registration in Kwale has been low and discouraging, an IEBC official has said. Amina Soud, the Independent Electoral and Boundary Commission manager in charge of the county, said out of 8,000 people targeted this year, only 600 have been registered.Â She said the figure does not reflect the massive efforts made in creating awareness. "This number is too small compared to the rounds I to encourage you people about the process," she said. Soud spoke during Jamhuri Day celebrations in Mkongani, Matuga subcounty. The event was attended by county commissioner Karuku Ngumo, among other leaders. Ngumo promised to help the IEBC manager to mobilise residents to turn up for the drive. Soud said public education is crucial but blamed government offices for stifling the exercise by refusing to support it. Only a few officers respond to her office even though many are requested to create time for awareness campaigns, she said. "I have begged to be given a duration of one hour in any of the working days to educate their employees on the matter of registration, but just a quarter had responded. The rest have remained silent," she said. Soud said training helps in convincing people to come out to be listed. She expressed concern that Kenyans are getting accustomed to last-minute rush that results in confusion and errors, and have been ignoring the exercise when there are no queues. She appealed to residents to avail themselves for registration so they have adequate time to verify their details and ensure any error is rectified in time before the electioneering.
