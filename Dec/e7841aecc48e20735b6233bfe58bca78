Kenyan national team boxers are set to start residential training next month in preparations for the Olympic qualifiers slated for Dakar, Senegal. Boxing Federation Kenya secretary general,  David Munuhe said the preliminary squad was picked after the final round of the BFK League in Kisumu. He said majority of the ‘Hit Squad’ boxers who represented  the country at the recent Africa Games in Morocco maintained their places. Munuhe revealed  they are yet to settle on a specific camp to continue their preparations. “All I can say at the moment is that we will start our training in January but the details will be released later,” said the BFK secretary. The boxing body had intended to take their fighters for a training camp in either Kazakhstan or Azerbaijan subject to approval and funding from the Ministry of Sports. Their other option was to invite boxing teams from the region to aid their build-up to the qualifiers. “We have not received a  response from the countries that we had hoped would host us. Maybe it is because of this festive period that things are not going on as swiftly as we would have expected. We hope to get a clear picture by early next year,” he explained. Over 28  boxers were named to the preliminary national squad but some were picked for training and sparring purposes and may not make the squad to Senegal.
