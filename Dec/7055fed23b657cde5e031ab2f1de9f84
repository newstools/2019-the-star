   A clergyman has attributed the high rate of broken marriages in Embu county to premarital sex. The Rev Paul Kithuka, who is Methodist Church of Kenya Mbeere Circuit superintendent minister, said most youths engaged in sexual intercourse during courtship before understanding and knowing each other well. The consequences are early pregnancies which force the youth to marry for  convenience’s sake. Kithuka spoke on Monday at Bishop Kim MCK church at Kiambuthi in Embu Town. He said that many such marriages break up after couples realise that they did not understand one another. He advised the youth to be patient and get to know their partners better and avoid premarital sex. They should also seek counsel from the church for their relationships to endure. “Many youths have been engaging in sex before marriage which is against the teaching of Jesus Christ,” the clergyman said. He, however, advised them that they can repent and solemnise their marriages after being counselled on the best way to lead a Christian life. Kithuka reminded them that even Jesus’ father, Joseph, contemplated breaking up with Mary (Jesus' mother) after discovering that she was pregnant. He assumed that she had been engaging in premarital sex with somebody else. However, all ended well after God sent Angel Gabriel to tell him that the pregnancy was holy and he should not end his relationship with her. The clergyman asked the youth to emulate Joseph and avoid premarital sex.  He condemned sex orgies that the youths engage in during Christmas and advised them to instead attend fellowships alongside their future marriage partners.
