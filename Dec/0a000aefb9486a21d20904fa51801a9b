First Lady Margaret Kenyatta launched the 2020 edition of Beyond Zero Half Marathon and restated her commitment to continuing advocating for initiatives aimed at improving provision of quality healthcare to women and children. The First Lady announced the expansion of the Beyond Zero medical scholarship programme from the current 100 to 200 beneficiaries next year. She said the funds raised through the marathon will be deployed to refurbish health facilities as well as kick-start the process of setting up a specialised Beyond Zero referral health facility. “Through the funds raised we will continue to be responsive to the needs of communities by rebuilding or refurbishing and equipping specialized health units to serve communities in marginalised areas,” the First Lady said. Earlier, the First Lady and her team of trainers who included world marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge and his wife Grace braved the morning downpour to kick start her training for the marathon scheduled for March 8, 2020.

She urged Kenyans and well-wishers to continue supporting efforts aimed at enhancing the delivery of health services in the country including the Beyond Zero initiative. “Our work is not finished.

She thanked the marathon’s stakeholders including donors for their continued support saying Beyond Zero mobile clinics and the Beyond Zero medical safaris launched last year have touched millions of lives through free medical services, advocacy and awareness.
