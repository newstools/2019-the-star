Famine relief maize meant for starving Mbeere residents worth Sh2.25 million has been destroyed by health officers for being unfit for consumption. The 500 bags of maize at the National Cereals and Produce Board stores in Kiritiri town in Mbeere South subcounty were buried by the public health officers from the Embu county government and the Interior ministry. Briefing the press yesterday, Embu Health executive Patrick Waganagwa said they received the maize to alleviate hunger in Mbeere, whose residents were starving following crop failure. The maize was received from the NCPB but upon testing was found to be unfit for human consumption. “Owing to this finding, we sought a court order from a Siakago court to destroy the maize to prevent it from being used by residents so that it does not harm their health,” Waganagwa said. The official said some of the maize was found to have decayed, some had unusual colour and others were infested by pests. These conditions of the maize would have caused serious diseases to the consumers, he said. Waganagwa said there were more 500 bags of maze the county had received from the National Cereals and Produce Board for Mbeere North subcounty which they are testing, noting that if they are found to be substandard according to the requirements they will also be destroyed. The executive said samples of the maize have been taken to the government laboratories for assessment and that they are waiting for the results. Waganagwa hailed the Embu county commissioner Addullahi Galgalo for the collaboration he and the Interior Ministry administration had accorded the Health department in protecting residents from the unsafe maize.
