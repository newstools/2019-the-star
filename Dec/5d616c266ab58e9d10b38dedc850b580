The Law Society of Kenya wants the Kwale county government to give proper resolution on conflicts brewing between Australian mining company Base Titanium and neighbouring communities. Speaking on Monday in a meeting meant to educate locals on natural resources, mining and land rights in Msambweni, a member of the LSK Caroline Katisya said counties have been constitutionally mandated to solve disputes through comprehensive talks with both investors and people involved. She said the county has a responsibility to play over its people even if the mineral and natural resources belong to the national government. “We are aware that minerals have not been devolved but they are mined within people’s proximity,” Katisya said. She said the issue of compensations, relocations and challenges resulting from mining should be addressed by the county. Katisya said the region’s administration has to stretch a helping hand and work together with the national government to protect the rights of both sides in the conflict. Leaders must create and maintain a good relationship with people through forums that are meant to bring peace, she said. “It is important for the county to be at the front in establishing peace dialogues to make the community feel safe and secure,” she said adding that the move will help form good rapport. The lawyer also said the Kwale government must make sure women are fully involved in issues of lands and mineral resources. “Things like eviction touch on the wellbeing of matrimonial homes where females are also affected so any decision must bring them on board." She said women have the right to be associated with important projects designed to bring development. Meanwhile, LSK and the Kwale Youth Governance Consortium have launched a programme that will make sure community and women's rights are observed when it comes to mining and land issues.
