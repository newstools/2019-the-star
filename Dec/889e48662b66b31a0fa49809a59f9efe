Rift Valley MPs and senators have urged the government to address low maize prices. Speaking to the press in Naivasha, Samburu Senator Steve Lelegwe said there should be policies to shore up the region’s agricultural potential to deliver on the Big Four agenda. “We are deeply concerned by the dropping prices for maize and poultry products which have been affected by cheap imports from neighbouring countries,” he said. Lelegwe said the government in the Big Four agenda and the Jubilee manifesto states that it would create a food acquisition programme. “This will mandate it to buy 50 per cent of its food requirements from small-scale farmers and double fertiliser subsidies in five years”, he said. Turkana North MP Christopher Nakuleu said security was the foundation for the economic, social and cultural well-being of residents in the region. He said a large part of the Rift Valley had been subjected to perennial insecurity occasioned mainly by cattle rustling. “The consequences of this situation are dire and amount to effective disenfranchisement of many innocent Kenyans who are unable to participate in normal life,” he said. Nakuleu said they want a clear and effective policy, including a viable legislative framework on matters concerning police reservists and the entire security sector. “As has been well-captured in the BBI, security must be reconfigured to become a citizen-centered service and to move away from the casual and unsatisfactory manner that has characterised the handling of cattle rustling and insecurity,” he said. While supporting the BBI process, Nakuleu said there was need to ensure that land rights were protected to promote cohesion and that the sanctity of the title must be guaranteed by the state. On the ongoing rains, the legislator urged the ministry responsible for disasters to develop a comprehensive strategy to avoid further deaths instead of engaging ‘post disaster’ reactions.
