Reigning women champions Equity Bank take on Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) in play-off final matches at Makande Welfare hall today in Mombasa. Equity Bank tactician David Maina said they are all set for the two opening fixtures that will define the way the rest of the five-game series will go. “We arrived here earlier and went straight to work. I have the full squad in training now after some players missed the first session,” Maina said from Mombasa. He added: “We are prepared for the fight. It will not be easy since we start the matches against a team playing at home but we will give it our all.” KPA tactician Mike Opel said his only worry remains an injury suffered by play-maker Natalie Akinyi who was not available for the semi-finals against Storms last week. He, however, expect her to be ready. He said they will make it to Nairobi immediately after Game Two on Sunday to  prepare for the rest of the fixtures. “We have been told that the other three games will start in Nairobi on Wednesday.” Equity, who are the top seed in the regular season beat University of Nairobi Dynamites 3-0 in the semi-finals while KPA also shut out Storms with the same margin. There will be classification matches as well as Dynamites play Storms in a tie that will determined who finishes in fourth. Meanwhile, Ulinzi Warriors beat Thunder 123-104 in double over time in a closely contested Game Two to tie the best of five game series 1-1 going into yesterday night’s pivotal Game 3.
