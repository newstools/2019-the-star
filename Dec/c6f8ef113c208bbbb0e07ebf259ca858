A suspected criminal was killed by police at Bamburi, Kisauni subcounty, and another by a mob in Likoni. The suspect was shot dead around 3am on Monday after police ambushed a gang of eight with pangas, subcounty police commander Julius Kiragu said. “This is the festive season and if we don’t do that, crime goes up. Mombasa has many visitors we don’t want our people to suffer,” he said. He said members of the public noticed the group hiding near Old Naivas stage and notified them. Police recovered three pangas as other suspects escaped with bullet wounds. “I was woken up by gunshots. This is too much...we no longer have peace in Bamburi,” a resident told the Star in confidence. Hours later, another suspected gang member was ambushed and killed by a mob in Mrima area of Likoni. Reports indicate that he was cornered by the public while robbing one of the houses at dawn. The incidence comes barely five days after police arrested 11 suspects following a gang attack which left 10 hospitalised on November 24. Police said the 11 who were aged between 15-25 could have been members of Wakali Kwanza gang. The shooting comes as 10,000 head teachers meet in Nyali for the annual Kenya Primary School Heads Association conference. The head teachers began arriving on Sunday for the conference which begins on Tuesday. On Monday, Mombasa police boss Augustine Nthumbi told the Star that cops allayed insecurity fears. “There is an operation order and we have enough personnel,” Nthumbi said. Police officers tasked with providing security during the teachers meet will be drawn from Kisauni and Nyali jurisdictions, the Star has learned. Early last week, KEPSHA’s top leadership met with county top security brass. “We will not take anything for granted. We have incorporated everything and we are good to go security-wise. That's why some of those criminals are being dealt with even before they execute their plans,” a security official privy with the preparations said. Edited by R.Wamochie
