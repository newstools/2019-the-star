The Building Bridges Initiative report will be derailed if political considerations drive its debate, Lugari MP Ayub Savula has said. Savula said that Kenyans should be allowed to read the proposals made by the BBI task force to make decisions on how they want to be governed. He said that the politics being played around the BBI report should be avoided in the interest of all citizens. “We have failed to create the Kenya we want and God has given us another change which we should not waste for personal reasons,” he said. The lawmaker said that changes to the Constitution must address issues of economic empowerment and social well-being of Kenyans. They should also ensure the entrenchment of structures that guarantee responsive leadership, equitable resource sharing and development for future generations. “It's unfortunate that some people are looking at the report as a proposal to create positions for political satisfaction instead of posterity,” he said. Elected leaders from Central and Rift Valley regions have met and declared support for the BBI report. They have however differed on the mode of its implementation. He said that the final decision will be made by Kenyans themselves and not MPs,  saying the push by a section of elected leaders to implement the report through parliament was “mischievous”. Savula spoke during the funeral of Wycliffe Owino at Mukunyuku village in Matungu subcounty on Saturday. He said that those opposed to the BBI were doing so because they were interested in power.
