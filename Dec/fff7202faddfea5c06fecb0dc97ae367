Murang'a Seal hope for a better second half of the National Super League season after an encouraging debut in the second-tier show. When the first leg ended over the weekend, the new boys found themselves in eighth placeâ€”just 10 points off the second automatic promotion slot. "We are well within the target we set at the beginning of the season. Our performances, however, has shown that with the stability that is now in the team after a relatively slow start, we can even challenge for the promotion," said coach David Mahira. Seal, who enjoyed back-to- back promotions to reach the second division have amassed 26 points from 18 matches. Their rise up the table, according to Mahira has been largely undermined by the number of stalemates the team has been forced to settle for. "We have drawn matches that we probably should have won. That is what we are going to work on before the second leg begins. We have to take our chances when we are dominating games and when we do, we should not let our opponents back in the game," he observed. Mahira was non-committal on whether they will be making new signings to beef up their squad before the league resumes on January 11. "Bringing in new players will depend on several things most importantly the state of our squad which I believe right now is okay and also the availability of funds,"he concluded. Seal will continue their challenge for promotion with a trip to Camp Toyoyo where they confront Kibera All-Stars.
