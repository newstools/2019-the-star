Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko is facing charges of corruption and the court will decide if he is guilty or innocent. However, the state itself is culpable of allowing him to become governor. Sonko was a disaster waiting to happen. He did not have the leadership skills to lead Nairobi county. He also had a criminal record. By his own admission, he had been locked up in Shimo la Tewa 20 years ago and had served time in Kamiti and the Industrial Area prisons. Now Shimo la Tewa wants Sonko returned to finish his sentence. The DPP says Sonko should not get bail because he is a flight risk since he escaped prison. In 2017, Jubilee saw Sonko as a useful tool to mobilise the youth and defeat incumbent Governor Evans Kidero. Jubilee helped Sonko to get the necessary certificate of good conduct. But Sonko should never have been cleared to stand for election by the police, EACC and IEBC. They all knew of his criminal past. We need to learn from this fiasco. In future, we should strictly enforce the Leadership Code so that compromised candidates are disqualified from elections. Quote of the day: You can tell whether a man is clever by his answers.
