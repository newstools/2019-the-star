Nairobi Woman Rep Esther Passaris is set to sue blogger Robert Alai for constantly defaming her on social media. This move comes after Alai alleged that Nairobi County leaders, were not fighting corruption but rather distracted by other matters. "With Sonko in custody, the Akiba Estate land grabber is back digging the piece of land. Sonko accused EACC head of investigations as being behind the grabbing of the piece of land. MP and MCA basically doing nothing," Alai said. Alai further accused Passaris of promiscuity in the post that was later deleted. But Passaris has not taken this with a pinch of salt. Instead, she has directed her lawyers to take up the matter. "I have instructed my lawyers. #RobertALiar will have his 'days of doom' sooner rather than later," Passaris said. She said that she will pursueÂ the matter and ensure that the blogger respects women and those in office. "...It is honestly pathetic that over the years he derives relevancy by attempting to demean my being and my stature to whats between my legs," she said. This is not the first time the two are engaging each other on Twitter. In May 2017, the blogger yet again took a swipe at Passaris with disparaging remarks.
