Nandi leaders want the BBI report to be implemented without going to a referendum. They urged for sobriety, saying a referendum might divide the nation similar to what happened during the constitutional referendum in 2005. MPs Julius Meli of Tinderet, Wilson Kogo of Chesumei, Cornelly Serem of Aldai and Senator Samson Cherargei said the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition supremo Raila Odinga brought stability and unity in Kenya. “We should not destroy the platform that has ensured tranquillity across the nation,” Meli said. They spoke on Saturday at Got Ne Lel Girls High School when they presided over the issuance of licenses to 1,000 boda boda operators in Tinderet constituency. The legislators, however, noted that agriculture, which is the backbone of the economy, has not been conclusively tackled. “We need prices for farm produce to be increased. All sectors from tea, coffee, sugar cane, rice to maize are ailing and farmers are suffering,” Serem said. Kogo said Kenyans must be careful and learn from the 2005 referendum, which split the country and ended up in the 2007-08 post-election violence because of political competition. “Politics and competition for leadership positions should never be allowed to be a source of division among us. Let's debate the BBI document without issuing threats to any grouping or individuals,” Kogo said. Cherargei said the 156-page BBI report belongs to all Kenyans as its intentions are meant to end divisions and exclusivity. “It's not an exclusive club document for certain groups of people but for all Kenyans. The speeches of the President and Raila Odinga were clear on the BBI. We don’t expect any to backtrack,” Cherargei said.
