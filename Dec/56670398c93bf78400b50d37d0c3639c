Stakeholders in climate now want the indigenous knowledge of weather-focusing incorporated into modern scientific methods. This, they noted, will help in more accurate weather forecasts. Speaking during a climate information system workshop at the weekend, Garissa elder Dubat Amey said the indigenous indicators that worked well in old days have been ignored. The one day workshop was meant to enlighten the community on the role of planning ahead when adverse weather patterns are anticipated. Amey said adverse weather had far-reaching effects to people, especially pastoralists. "When you ask the old people they will tell you how they had their own systems of predicting rain which involved looking at the sequence of happenings in the previous years among them migratory patterns of birds among others. We need to go back to this,” Amey said. Environment CEC Habon Aden said through the department of Meteorology and other non-state actors, the county was exploring mechanisms and intervention that can be put in place to have timely climate warnings. “We are being faced by the reality of climate change which is having adverse effects on us. It is for this reason that we need to go back to the drawing board and come up with interventions and mechanisms that will help us address the situation,” Aden said. "We now have devolution which means we can now have better access to the indigenous knowledge and a better framework of knowledge that is easily accessible to the local community," she added. She said her department will take a leading role in ensuring the information reaches the community at the grassroots in a language they understand best. County Meteorological Services director Samwel Odhiambo welcomed the call to integrate traditional and scientific ways to come up with a product that can easily be accommodated. Edited by R.Wamochie
