Kitui county held its third annual Public goat auctioning and cultural event where more than 500 goats were sold on Saturday. The event was graced by senior government official led by ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru, and Kenya Film Classification Board boss Ezekiel Mutua among other leaders. The goats, sold at a fixed price of Sh7,000 each, saw farmers from various cooperatives pocket more than Sh3.5 million. Speaking during the event CS Mucheru thanked Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua for organising the event, and urged farmers to utilise the Digital Commodities Exchange where goats and other products could be sold online and potential buyers from across the world would buy. “I urge locals here to embrace digital commodities exchange for goats to ensure a higher sale thus improving living standards,” urged the CS. Mucheru said that selling of products through the online commodities exchange would help farmers in doing away with middle men who have been oppressing farmers by buying their products at low prices. “In online exchange platforms, the mystery of middleman is addressed and farmers are able to pocket much more money,” stated Mucheru. Senator Wambua said his dream was to improve the welfare of Kitui farmers where animal farming has been doing well. “Kitui is a rich goat belt and I hope to transform it into a national goat hub to improve famers lives,” he said. Mwingi Central MP Dr Gideon Mulyungi lauded the senator for organising the event, saying that it would transform the lives of Kitui farmers. “Transforming lives of residents is what every leader should aim at,” stated Mulyungi. The event was held at Nguni market in Mwingi central subcounty of Kitui.
