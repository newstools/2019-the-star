The trial of 47 men charged with same sex public displays of affection in Nigeria has been adjourned until February. The prosecution failed to provide any witnesses against the accused for the second day running. The trial that was not open to the media was adjourned by the judge with a warning to the prosecution team that February would be their final chance, according to an eyewitness. The men who were arrested at a birthday party in 2018 have all pleaded not guilty to the charges. At the time of their arrest, their faces were shown on Nigerian television stations. Some of the accused have told the BBC the publicity around the arrest has led to them becoming estranged from their families and losing their jobs.
