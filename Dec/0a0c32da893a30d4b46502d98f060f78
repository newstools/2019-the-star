Kenyan teachers have have two weeks to declare their wealth failure to which they will pay a Sh1m ($9000: Â£7000) fine, according to a circular reissued on Monday. The teachers are part of a wider group of public servants in the country who are expected to fill wealth declaration forms by 31 December. Public servants have to reveal how much they own to show that they have not been bribed. In November, the Public Service Commission (PSC) said that all the 842,900 government, county and workers in government-owned corporations must declare their incomes, bank deposits, assets like land, real estate and vehicles. President Uhuru Kenyatta has previously backed lifestyle audits on holders of public offices to curb corruption.
