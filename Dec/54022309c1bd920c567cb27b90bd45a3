Deputy President William Ruto has said he has no problem if a constitutional change brought about by BBI will settle for a parliamentary or presidential system of government. “We have no problem with BBI being subjected to a referendum or through Parliament. So long us the people are comfortable we will move forward,” he said. Ruto, however, said the leadership of the country should not be decided in boardrooms. “If they want parliamentary system, presidential system or whatever name it will be called, so long us the people decide, it is fine,” he said. Ruto spoke on Monday during the Mumboha Hustlers Cup, Luanda, in Vihiga county. The DP had previously alleged there was a plot by BBI proponents to set him up to oppose the popular vote, thus making him look bad and an enemy of the people. This made him make an about-turn to support a referendum to implement the BBI report. Ruto had initially differed with President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga when the two called for a people-driven BBI process. The DP on Monday said he was comfortable with contents in the BBI report and was not going to oppose anything that was pro-people. He also said it is Kenyans who would decide the fate of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) report. He noted that the report can assume either the referendum or the Parliament route depending on what Kenyans wanted. The Deputy President said the country should not expend most of its energy on the review of the constitution. “Let BBI not divert us from our primary work of transforming Kenya, and making the people more economically empowered,” he said.
