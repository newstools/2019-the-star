A criminal case against former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero's son Ronald Odhiambo has failed o proceed due to lack of police files. The case in which Odhiambo is accused of storage of substandard petroleum products was scheduled for hearing on Friday before chief magistrate Francis Andayi but police files and witnesses were not present in court. This prompted a senior state counsel to apply for an adjournment. Andayi granted the application and ordered the case to proceed on March 23 without further delay. Odhiambo is charged with storing 14,000 litres of diesel and 28,000 litres of gasoline which did not meet the specifications of the Kenya Bureau of Standards. He has since denied the charges and he is out on bail of Sh100,000. Motorist David Nyamu lodged a complaint with the police after fueling at the Shell Petrol Station at Ridgeways along Kiambu Road owned by Odhiambo. Samples taken by the detectives from Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters found that the fuel was substandard. Earlier, the court heard that the regulation of fuel dealers is in the purview of the Energy Regulation Commission. It is said that theÂ commission had not raised concerns over Odhiambo's station.
