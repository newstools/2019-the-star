Human Rights Defenders are key people in society as they stand tall and fight for our rights tirelessly. Their efforts need to be appreciated since they go the extra mile to give a voice to the voiceless in society. The event was held at the French ambassadorâ€™s residence on November 29 led by the Ambassador Aline Kuster-Menager. In attendance were former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga and envoys. Ryan Muiruri, whose organisation scooped an award, said he was happy that society has started to recognise intersex people.
