Kiambu needy students and those joining Form 1 will benefit from Sh75 million bursary. Kahawa Wendani MCA and assembly sectoral committee on education chairperson Cyrus Omondi said on Tuesday that the money has already been channelled to the county bursary fund kitty. “Parents and guardians of needy students undergo stress when taking their children to Form 1 because bursary funds come later. That is why we have made the funds available,” he said. Omondi said only students in vocational training institutions received bursary funds this year. “The last batch of bursary to high school was made in 2018 and this year the only bursary issued went to vocational training,” he said. Omondi said they have ordered an audit of the previous bursaries issued because misappropriation of the funds was the reason why cash was not given for a whole year, yet the assembly had approved the bursary budget. Deputy Governor James Nyoro on Jamhuri Day assured Kiambu residents that the bursary will be availed on time. He said the first batch will be released in January  2020 and the second in March. “I assure you that those who deserve to benefit from bursary will get it on time, especially Form 1,” he said. Nyoro said no bursary money will be lost and every coin will be accounted for. “We have started distributing bursary fund forms and by Christmas Day, we want the forms to have been filled and returned so that a transparent vetting committee can complete its work on time,” he said. Each of the 60 wards will get Sh1.52 million. In November, over Sh24 million was distributed to beneficiaries in vocational colleges
