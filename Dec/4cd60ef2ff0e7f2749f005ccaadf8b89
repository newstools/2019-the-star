Sheffield United plan to recruit new players in the January transfer window as their impressive start to the season has put them in a good position to consider investment in the squad, manager Chris Wilder said. The Blades, who returned to the Premier League after 12 years, were expected to struggle but Wilder’s side sit eighth with 22 points from 16 games. However, Wilder is concerned the high intensity of the Premier League will begin to take its toll on the players and he identified “two or three” positions that need to be reinforced next month. “I’ve said to the owners that maybe if we were in a different position you should keep your hand in your pocket,” Wilder told a news conference ahead of Saturday’s league match against Aston Villa. “But I think now is the moment to strengthen and we’ll have conversations regarding where we can go with that. It’s important that we get the balance right, get the right players in from a mentality point of view and to strengthen the group. “In our position we need to because there is still a lot of football to be played and the intensity of the league... is huge. I do feel there’s two or three positions where we are a little bit light.” The Blades, who lost their last home game to Newcastle United, host fellow promoted side Villa who are 17th in the standings with just one win from their last seven matches. Wilder’s side have lost four times at Bramall Lane this season and he expects Villa to give them a stern test. “There was a lot of disappointed players and supporters after the Newcastle game,” Wilder said. “Something we’ve been pretty good at is reaction to defeat. “Villa have got a lot of attacking players. They’ll want to dominate possession and drive us back. “I think it’s going to be a brilliant game. The talent that they’ve got right the way through the team is there to be seen.”
