Bungoma  Senator Moses Wetang’ula wants issues surrounding the Building Bridges Initiative dispensed with before Easter next year. Speaking at his Kanduyi home,Wetang’ula said that while his party Ford Kenya fully supports proposals of the BBI it was prudent that everything surrounding it is  finished before April next year so that it doesn’t  slip into 2022 succession politics. “While we are fully supporting very many things in the BBI report it is prudent that the issue  it is finished so that it is not used in the electioneering period or  2022 succession politics ,” Wetang'ula said. Wetangula said it was important that a proper road map was set  to avoid such scenario. He said reverting the country into parliamentary system and strengthening devolution were some of the  superb ideas captured in the report. The Ford Kenya party leader said it was important that the President  deals with the skyrocketing the public debt. “It is  unfortunate that  the public debt of this country  is painting a scaring and gloomy picture of this country,” he said. He said that he was worried that the public debt was increasing, which was worrying for the country. Wetang’ula further  urged that the  President should take the war on corruption  to a higher level  by ensuring recovery of public resources obtained  through corruption. This, he said, will only be possible to achieve  if the organs mandated to fight corruption are strengthened. “The office of the DPP should be added more money and given more experts in fields they require. The DCI should  also  be better equipped if we want to really fight corruption ,” he said. Wetang’ula regretted that the Court of Appeal which plays a major role in corruption had moved back to Nairobi from the regions because of lack of resources . He at the same time said the delay to appoint the auditor general will also increase corruption cases because many  government entities go unaudited.
