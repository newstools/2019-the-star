People still living at Kirisia Forest in Samburu county have 30  days to vacate the forest. Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko asked politicians and residents to stop dragging politics and tribalism into government’s efforts to protect the forest. The CS directed the government surveyor to work with the county government to clearly mark the forest’s boundary. Tobiko spoke on Tuesday at Tamiyoi within Kirisia Forest in Samburu Central subcounty where he led residents in planting more than 10,000 tree seedlings after 4, 000 people volunteered to vacate. The tree planting event was attended by Woman representative Maison Leshoomo, Samburu West MP Naisula Lesuuda and Deputy Governor Julius Leseeto. Leshoomo asked the government to help the illegal settlers who had volunteered out of the forest. But Tobiko said the government has done enough by providing free transport to help them move out of the forest. Lepunye Community Forest Association chairman Charles Leng’uro reiterated that everyone will leave the forest after community elders met and jointly agreed. “Those are just politics, nobody has refused to vacate the forest. Elders met and we all agreed that people must move out of the forest,” he said. Edited by R.Wamochie
