Kenya has some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Other counties have toilets and washrooms along all the most frequented public beaches. The bushes should not be used as alternative toilets. But in our very own beautiful nation, beachgoers will dump ‘spent cartridges’ (condoms) under the white sands of the beach they will later use. If spotted, they should face the full wrath of the law. We should keep the beaches as beautiful and as clean as possible because they are part of what attracts both local and international visitors to the country, which in turn makes the nation revenue and a name. Furthermore, it will conserve the environment for marine life and make it easier to manage the beaches as opposed to starting a campaign to clean them up when it's too late.  Mombasa
