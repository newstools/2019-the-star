President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday evening met the Building Bridges Initiative Taskforce at State House, Nairobi where he requested the team to continue leading the process. The President who was in the company of ODM leader Raila Odinga, thanked the team for putting together a report that 'captured the aspirations of Kenyans'. According to a statement on Thursday morning from State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena, the Taskforce will now be mandated to steer the next phase of the process. "This will largely involve expanding and guiding public participation and structuring recommendations by Kenyans into implementable action plans," the statement read. However, the communication from State House did not indicate the exact time period of the extended term. The BBI report was officially launched by the President last month at the Bomas of Kenya. The report proposes that Kenyans continue to elect their President who remains the Head of State and Government. The report also says that the Deputy President should remain the principal assistant to the President and will be the running mate. Under the BBI, the President will appoint an MP from the largest party or coalition in Parliament as Prime Minister who will take up the position after being approved by Parliament. The report adds that the Prime Minister shall have supervision and execution of the day-to-day functions and affairs of the Government.
