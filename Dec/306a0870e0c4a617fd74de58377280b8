The Kisii municipal board is set to undertake a massive face-lift of the town at a cost of Sh164 million. The project, funded partly by the World Bank, will consist of the laying up of cabro in the town's back streets and the erection of lighting towers. Board chairperson Obote Motonu termed the town uplift project as an ambitious one. The upgrading is set to start any time soon, Motonu said, adding that drainage systems will also be done. Motonu spoke during a public participation forum at the town's Culture Hall. The municipality board was inaugurated earlier this year and yesterday's meeting was the first with the residents. Among other things, the board is tasked with the construction and maintenance of municipal markets, abattoirs, fire stations, emergency and disaster management It is further mandated to promote cultural activities within the county. But traders yesterday accused the municipal board officials of inviting them to rubber stamp decisions they have already undertaken. They also protested against the poor hygiene around the county capital which they termed as deplorable. Group leaderÂ  Meshack Yoge said the lack of ablution blocks in the markets may spark a health crisis. Motonu, however, said they are set to buy more trucks to improve garbage collection.
