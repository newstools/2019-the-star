Mombasa County Hockey Association chairman Oliver Mascaren has has reiterated continued support to Mombasa Sports Club following their promotion back to the Kenya Hockey Union men's Premier League. Mascaren congratulated the team for their new-found status and promised to back the team even more after making the county proud. He said: "On behalf of the executive council of Mombasa County Hockey Association, I would like to congratulate  MSC hockey team on their promotion to the KHU Premier League. They have truly made us proud and we wish them success in the top-flight league. We are also happy to learn that  Mombasa West hockey club will play in the National League next season," said the county boss. He continued: "We have already partnered with them to raise funds for their team through the Shaban Yusuf Memorial hockey festival in October. Next year, we will help all Mombasa teams raise funds by assisting them to host local tournaments." The county boss further called on corporates to help clubs run their activities smoothly since KHU Premier League has no sponsor. "The only way our local teams can compete effectively in the leagues is through corporate sponsorship. Unfortunately, KHU have not secured any sponsorship their leagues and most clubs are self-sponsored," he noted. He said as a county, they have tabled their concerns to KHU and hope they will be addressed as soon as possible. "Since clubs in Mombasa have to host upcountry teams on their own grounds, KHU should consider some waiver or compensation towards the Mombasa teams for maintaining and hiring their own grounds in Mombasa. We have tabled these concerns at KHU meeting and hope they will be urgently addressed," he added. Meanwhile, women's Super League side Wolverines are set to play in the Premier League hockey next season after claiming top spot with one game to spare.
