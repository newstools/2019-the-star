Kenyan rapper King Kaka has been summoned to appear before the DCI Headquarters in Kiambu, his manager has confirmed. Dennis Njenga told the Star that the artist has been told to appear before the DCI immediately and they were on their way to Kiambu. The summon comes a day after Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru threatened to sue the artist over defamation. Senior Counsel Ahmednasir Abdulahi on Tuesday vowed to represent the rapper against any defamation case that may arise from his song. Kaka revealed he had been summoned through his Twitter account on Tuesday morning. Activist Boniface Mwangi confirmed he had spoken to King Kaka who informed him he had been summoned. "His friends, fellow artistes and Kenyans of goodwill are joining him at DCI Headquarters, Kiambu Road, at 12 pm. If you're able to join us, see you there," he tweeted. The rapper had earlier claimed that his life had been threatened by unnamed individuals after the release of his latest seven-minute spoken-word piece, where he highlighted some of the corruption cases in the country.
