A new collaborative workspace dedicated to providing support and resources to help increase the capacity, quality and financial sustainability of independent journalism and media organisations in Kenya and across the region – Baraza Media Lab – has opened its doors. The lab is expected to encourage journalists, filmmakers, artists, social media experts and technologists to experiment with, test and build new ways of telling stories, new types of content, publishing platforms and media ventures.
