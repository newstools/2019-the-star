The ongoing rains in various parts of the country have left a trail of destruction across the country, killing several people, livestock and destroying property worth millions. Some natural circumstances such as landslides are beyond citizensâ€™ control but the disaster management unit has the capability of reducing the impact if it stays alert. The government should ensure there are enough manpower and resources to deal with disasters. Sometimes we do not pocket lessons from our mistakes and end up making the same mistakes over and over again.  Nairobi
