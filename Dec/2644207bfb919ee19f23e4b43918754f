Kenyatta National Hospital is the only other county health facility with an ICU. “Our mothers will acquire the best maternity care that the facility will officer,” county Health chief officer Mohammad Sahal said on Sunday He said its completion will increase the number of patients in the facility. In two years, patients have increased to 314,000 from 214,150 in 2017, a 32 per cent rise. The numbers will increase further once the new block is opened,” Sahal said. This financial year the maternity wing was allocated Sh100 million. The wing is a six-floor, H-shaped addition construction, which started in 2013, but stalled in 2016 due to underfunding. In May this year, the Sh69 million Phase One was 85 per cent complete. Mama Lucy is also experiencing a staff deficit of 284.

To address the issue, 94 casuals were hired in the 2017-18 financial year for Sh10. 3 million. The medical shortage is not confined to Mama Lucy but extends to all public health facilities in the city.
