Members of the Solai–Ruyoibei Farm Limited in Nakuru have questioned the alleged subdivision and titling of the controversial OlJorai farm in Gilgil. The members wondered how the land registrar's office in Naivasha subdivided the vast farm yet the mother title was deposited at the Environment and Lands court in Nakuru. They called on the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to probe the subdivision of the disputed former Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC) land. The Environment and Lands court in Nakuru declared more than 3,000 titles relating to the 8,000-acre land null and void. The judgement in the suit between Solai Ruyoibei Limited and Oljorai Company Limited stated that the land was acquired illegally. Through their lawyer Steve Opar, Solai-Ruyobei members questioned how more than 3,000 titles were issued by the lands registrar's office despite an order in 2013 to have the mother title deed deposited in court during the hearing of the matter. “We want the DCI to find out how the land registrar's office subdivided Oljorai farm whereas the mother title was still in court since 2013,” Opar said. Opar said the revoked titles were issued in 2014 and 2015 when the mother title deed was still in the custody of the court. “The titles revoked by the court had been fraudulently acquired after the mother title deed was deposited in court. Some were issued to unsuspecting buyers as from 2014/15/16 and 2018," he added. Opar was glad that Solai-Ruyobei was declared the rightful proprietor of the land by the lands court after a decade of the legal battle. He said they would be issuing a three-month eviction notice to settlers on the land. In the judgement, the court had ordered the chief land registrar and the district land registrar to expunge from their records all the 3,320 title deeds claimed to be genuine and dismissed the case filed by Oljorai Company Limited.
