 Some 6,000 households in Turkana West will benefit from a Sh600 million water project funded by the Danish government. The project, whose implementer is the parastatal Water Sector Trust Fund in collaboration with the Turkana county government, was launched in Kakuma on Monday. Kakuma is the second-largest refugee camp in the country and its residents will also benefit. Turkana Deputy Governor Peter Lotethiro said the project will address access to water, sanitation and water resources management in the area. “The water and livelihood programme funded by the Danish government will be implemented by other partners to benefit more than 6,000 households in Kakuma, Kalobeyei, Lopur, Songot and Lokichogio wards,” Lotethiro said. He called on the partners to employ local youths and award tenders to the Turkana business community. He also urged the partners to release funds in time. Water Sector Trust Fund is a state corporation mandated to finance water and sanitisation services for the poor and underserved communities. The chairman of its Board of Trustees, Patrick Kokonya, said the funding will be through the Danish International Development Agency (Danida). “The Water Fund will work with other partners, including OXFAM, World Vision Kenya, Action Help Africa International, AMREF, LOKADO and Norwegian Refugee Council to implement the project in Kakuma, Lokichogio, Kalobeyei, Lapur and Songot wards,” he said.
