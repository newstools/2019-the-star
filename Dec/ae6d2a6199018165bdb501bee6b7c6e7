Threats by the upshot of crimes may have necessitated the suspension of the annual leaves of over 5,000 police officers. The move by the Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai is commendable. Mutyambai said the leaves will be taken at a later date after the festivities.Â The move follows fears that criminal gangs might stage attacks during the festive season. To address fears of a rise in crime, police plan major operations in the country from next week. This will include traffic operations to tame road carnage. More focus will be in Mombasa where criminal gangs have been reported to attack residents in the recent past and areas next to the Kenya-Uganda border that has been targets of the al Shabaab terrorist group.
