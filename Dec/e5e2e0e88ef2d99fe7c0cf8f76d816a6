Police in Lamu are looking for an unknown attacker who slashed motorcyclists using a machete at Peleleza junction along the Mpeketoni-Kibaoni road in Lamu West. Three of his victims are currently admitted at the Mpeketoni sub-county hospital nursing deep machete cuts in their heads, legs and hands. The three include a boda boda operator, a teacher and a pastor, all of whom were riding motorbikes at the time they were attacked. All the victims reported to have been ambushed and attacked by the unknown male at around 7.30pm last Saturday. The victims reported seeing a man waving down road users especially those using motorcycles, after which he would attack them and flee into a neighbouring forest. Speaking from his hospital bed, 29 year old Morris Muli, a pastor at the Neno Evangelism church in Mpeketoni, said he was attacked as he headed to Hongwe from Mpeketoni. “He waved me down at Peleleza junction and as I slowed down close to where he was, he jumped and slashed me on the right side of my head with a panga. I screamed but sped off as I knew we would die if I didnt. I believe he is a robber targeting to steal motorbikes,” said Muli. Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia gave an assurance that police were on the case. Macharia said police are yet to capture the attacker and to ascertain his motive.
