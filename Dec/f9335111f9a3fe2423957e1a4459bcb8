A Meru MCA has decried th ehigh number of learners who missed out sitting for their final exams. A total of 411 pupils didn’t sit for their KCPE while about 29 girls in Meru did their final exams while pregnant. Athwana ward representative Victor Karithi said it was a shame that Tigania West subcounty recorded the highest number of pupils who had registered for KCPE but failed to turn up to do their exams. He spoke at Karumo Technical Training Institute in his ward when issuing blankets, mattresses, metal boxes and buckets to 129 pupils who scored 280 and above marks. In addition, Karithi paid Sh120, 000 first term fees for four pupils, including Imannuel Mutea who scored 408 marks, Gibson Kobia (408), Karani Imunya (354) and Miriam Karambu (360). Karithi said area leaders and parents should develop measures to curb early marriage, early pregnancies, dropping out of school and early initiation of boys. Karithi said it was also alarming that the subcounty recorded very low performances in KCPE and KCSE. “We urge people of good will to chip in and help raise education standards in our community through initiatives like this or even mentorship. This is our fifth edition and about 700 pupils have benefited," he said. "It is shame that many pupils registered for KCPE but never sat. Probably, some got married, some got circumcised and left, and others relocated with their families or dropped out of school. All candidates must be given a conducive environment to carry on their studies.” Meru county secretary Rufus Miriti said moral decay and lack of proper parental guidance was the root cause of early pregnancies.
