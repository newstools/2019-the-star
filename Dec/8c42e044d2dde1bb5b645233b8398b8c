The ninth edition of Mr and Miss Kibera Leadership Contest will go down tomorrow at the Kibera Primary School as part of the Amani Festival 2019. This beauty pageantry is a powerful platform for the young to engage and share experiences. Benson Ouma, one of the organisers, said in a statement, “Beauty is a tool that can be tapped to revolutionise and stimulate change in the community by offering a platform to engage on contemporary issues affecting the community. “The pageant is a platform for nurturing young people's agency for civic engagement, information sharing and leadership development and positive change.” Running under the theme, ‘Reimaging Beauty as a Tool for Stimulating Change’, it seeks to demystify beauty pageants, which have traditionally been seen to revolve around beauty and competition. This year’s event seeks to provide a rallying platform for young people in Kibera to engage in the national debate against corruption, sexual and gender-based violence, sexual and reproductive health rights, unemployment, extrajudicial killings and counter violent extremism. The youth will be taken through an experiential learning process to expose them to challenges faced by the youth within the community and activate them to develop a liking for a social cause.
