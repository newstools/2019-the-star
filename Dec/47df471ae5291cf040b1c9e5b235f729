Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei has been arrested in relation to hate speech in August. Cherargei was arrested on Tuesday, four months after recording a statement at the DCI offices in Kisumu county. He is expected in court on Tuesday to face charges of ethnic contempt. Detectives said that the senator made hateful remarks at Kilibwoni Primary School on August 17. He was later released on personal bail. He defended himself by saying that the remarks he made concerning support for Deputy President William Ruto's 2022 bid, and which led to his arrest, were misinterpreted. He said Kisumu DCI detectives questioned him about the meaning of the words he used. The senator had asked the state investigating agents to stop intimidating him. Cherargei had said that he wasÂ being investigated due to his position as the Chair of Senate Committee on Justice, Legal Affairs and Human Rights. The senator further questioned the DCI in regard to his arrest and he is yet to be arraigned. "I am surprised that these people have not taken me to court. They just want to intimidate me to write statements, threatening me with the blackmail of arrest," Cherargei said.
