The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) is an international treaty adopted in 1979 by the United Nations General Assembly. CEDAW aims at ensuring that traditional gender roles and stereotypes do not work against the interest of girls as the country still grapples with challenges of ending female genital mutilation, child marriage and sexual and gender-based violence. Women’s right to health includes their sexual and reproductive health. Therefore, any policy that wants to end discrimination against women must ensure they are getting all the health services they need. If put into practice, CEDAW can play an important role in ending discrimination against women. Key gaps in CEDAW implementation in Kenya are seen in the Marriage Act, Matrimonial Property Act and Land Rights Act. Ratifying CEDAW implies the convention should be part of the Constitution. However, in Kenya, sections of the three Acts contravene the CEDAW recommendations. For instance, the Marriage Act negates the gain of equality in marriage and calls on spouses to show contribution. The law also leaves the court with the discretion of deciding what the woman deserved. There are numerous cases of FGM, deaths related to unsafe abortion and mortality rates associated with a lack of skilled birth attendants. During doctors’ strikes, many deaths occur during delivery. For CEDAW recommendations to be effective in Kenya, there is a need to address the existing gaps. There is also a need to strengthen laws and policies around property ownership rights to ensure that in cases of separation, women have a share of property and child upkeep becomes a shared responsibility.
