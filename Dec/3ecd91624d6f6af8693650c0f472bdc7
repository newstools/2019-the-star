The opposition in Kenya is engulfed in a political truceâ€“hears and sees no evil as far as government running is concerned. Local artist King Kaka, in his latest song Wajinga Sisi, was just reminding our opposition chiefs that they should not take everything easy, that things are not as rosy as they seem. More must be done to rid Kenya of graft. All he said had been said before but forgotten. We forget bad things quickly. But when all these wrongs are put together into a song, we act as though they are new to us. It should be a wake-up call for us as we near the next polls.  Mombasa
