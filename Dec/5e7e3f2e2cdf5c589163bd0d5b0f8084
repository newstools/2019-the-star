Forced disarmament of illegal firearms in Turkana starts on Monday. This is after leaders and businessmen in possession of illegal firearms were given four days to surrender them. County commissioner Wambua Muthama on Jamhuri Day said they have a list of local leaders and businessmen in possession of illegal arms and the type of guns they own. He said local leaders and businessmen acquire them illegally and hire guards for their protection against the law. In July, Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya announced a major forced disarmament operation against bandits in the North Rift region but the date was not disclosed. Muthama said since disarmament started, they have only collected 190 firearms from the hands of civilians who voluntarily surrendered them and also through the efforts of the government. “You only have four days to surrender them before the crackdown starts because the government has already provided security in the region. We know your names and type of guns you own, surrender them before we came for you,” he said on December 12. In November, residents of Turkana South voluntarily surrendered 53 illegal firearms and 300 round of ammunition as demanded by the government. However, about 8,000 illegal firearms believed to be held in the North Rift region. Muthama warned chiefs not to hinder the disarmament exercise and if found a barrier, they risk being sacked immediately. Edited by R.Wamochie
