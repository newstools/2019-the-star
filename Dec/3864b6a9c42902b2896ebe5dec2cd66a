A section of leaders have cautioned former Senator Johnstone Muthama over his constant attacks on Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka. The leaders drawn from Machakos, Kitui and Makueni were responding to Muthama's remarks that he is now the new kingpin of the Ukambani region. The leaders cautioned Muthama of steering his own political schemes against the Wiper leader adding that he rather ditch the party. "We have a presidential candidate come 2022 who is Kalonzo Musyoka. If Muthama cannot toe the party line let him quit. Wiper is a free democratic party and he is free to join or quit. If he cannot withstand the heat, let him leave the kitchen," they said. Addressing the press in Machakos, the leaders led by Kitui Senator Enock Wambua and Kathiani MP Robert Mbui, said Kalonzo has declared that his name will be on the ballot. Wambua said that they have a strategy on steps that the party will adopt to ensure Kalonzo is on the ballot and clinches the presidency in 2022. "We have started planning for 2022 and this time round we are determined to make sure that Kalonzo clinches the top seat," he said. Mbui asked Ukambani leaders including Muthama to accord Kalonzo unrelenting respect and support. He said people in the larger Lower Eastern region should remain steadfast behind the former Vice President. This, he said, was the only way that the region would be respected by other ethnic groups in the countdown to 2022 election and beyond. Wiper Secretary-General Peter Mathuki said all leaders who were elected on Wiper have no alternative but to respect Kalonzo if they wanted to remain politically relevant. Recently, the former Senator vowed to lead coalition talks between Deputy President William Ruto and Kalonzo. On Wednesday, Muthama contradicted his recent statement of leading a delegation of senior political leaders from Ukambani to negotiate for Kalonzoâ€™s position with DP Rut0.
