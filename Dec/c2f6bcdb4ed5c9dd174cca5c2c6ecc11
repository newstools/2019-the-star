New Controller of Budget Margaret Nyang'ate Nyakang'o was on Wednesday sworn in by Chief Justice David Maraga. The ceremony was held at the Supreme Court Building in Nairobi. Maraga urged Nyakang’o to uphold the rule of law and the Constitution in service. The Finance and National Planning Committee in its report tabled in the National Assembly on Tuesday established that Nyakang’o is suitable for the job after her vetting last week. Nyakang’o replaces Agnes Odhiambo whose eight-year term ended on August 27. The new budget controller’s immediate task will be among others, to investigate why 15 county governments have defaulted paying suppliers, a move that has prompted the National Treasury to request Parliament's approval to stop fund transfers to them. She will be in charge of withdrawals from the public kitty as well as manage the growing appetite by the devolved units that have perennially overshot set limits on monthly spending for MCAs' sitting allowances and foreign and domestic travels. The 47 county governments have consistently missed their revenue targets since the advent of devolution in 2013. Odhiambo also raised the red flag over the ballooning public expenditures driven largely by salaries of workers of bloated national and county governments. Under CoB Act, any Kenyan citizen can serve as the Controller of Budget as long as they hold a degree in Finance, Accounting or Economics and meet the constitutional threshold for integrity.
