The state has named Total Kenya’s director of strategy Macharia Irungu as the managing director of the Kenya Pipeline Corporation (KPC). In a statement by Petroleum and Mining John Munyes, Irungu beat 88 applicants who were eyeing the position and emerged winner out of the 8 that were selected. “Dr. Irungu, who scored highest during the final Board interviews, brings over twenty-eight years’ experience in the oil & gas industry, with eleven of the years spent at the highest levels of management,” read the statement. This brings to close the one year search for a substantial managing director, a position that was last held by former MD Joe Sang, who prematurely exited in December last year. His exit was followed by an arrest alongside company secretary Gloria Khafafa, head of procurement Vincent Cheruiyot, procurement manager Nicholas Gitobu and general manager in charge of infrastructure Billy Aseka. Sang and his team were accused of malpractice and theft of Sh528.5 million during the construction of the Sh1.7 billion Kisumu Oil Jetty. Irungu will replace Hudson Andambi who filled in the position in acting capacity following Sang’s exit over graft allegations. Adhambi had been acting as managing director as the board sought a substantial CEO, a position it advertised twice-in July and September.
