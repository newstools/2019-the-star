Kiambu Deputy Governor James Nyoro has warned contractors applying for advertised World Bank tenders that they will be disqualified if found canvassing. Nyoro said that the contractors are being duped so that they can give kickbacks to unscrupulous individuals. “In 2018-19 there were issues because of corruption and theft.  We have agreed with the Treasury that we must do a special audit except for contractors that we do not have a problem with,” Nyoro said. The deputy governor spoke on Sunday at Kahawa Wendani Ruiru subcounty. He said that the government has put measures for paying pending bills but it will be done on a financial year basis. Nyoro said a special audit must be done to establish why there are pending bills in some financial years. “Kiambu is among 15 counties where the national treasury has said that it will not distribute their equitable revenue resource due to pending bills of sh 1.5 billion, I want you to tell me who did not pay because it is not Nyoro,” he said.
