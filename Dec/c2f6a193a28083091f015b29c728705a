An Administration Policeman who murdered 10 people at Siakago in Embu while pursuing his allegedly unfaithful girlfriend has been jailed for only 20 years. Embu resident judge Florence Muchemi handed Peter Karanja 20 years for each of the 10 counts but said they would run concurrently. Karanja was reported to have been on night duty at the District Commissioner's residence when he sprayed the 10 with bullets in different Siakago bars. Muchemi declined to give a non-custodial sentence to the former cop after his lawyer Victor Andande applied for leniency. He said his client was remorseful and was suffering from a terminal illness. Muchemi said the crime was too serious. Andande also sought to have the sentence backdated 10 years, arguing that Karanja has been in custody since the murders took place in 2010. However, Muchemi asked the lawyer to make a formal application saying she could not depend on his verbal application. While making the judgment, Muchemi said the prosecution witnesses proved beyond any reasonable doubt that Karanja committed the offences. As the sentence was read to him, the former AP appeared impassive. He has 14 days to appeal. Karanja was accused of murdering Anthony Mwaniki, Frida Ng’endo, Kenwin Muthomi, Agostino Kinyua and George Ng’ang’a on November 6, 2010, at Siakago. Other counts relate to the murder of Domisiano Muchira, Ephantus Munyi, Rachel Muthoni, Wilfred Gitonga and Fredrick Okwako. Gitonga and Okwako were APs based at the Mbeere North DC’s office. The court was told that Karanja got the news his girlfriend was cheating on him in Siakago. At about 11:30pm that day, Karanja excused himself to answer a call of nature but instead walked down the streets and into different bars. He would ask for his girlfriend and shoot anyone until he ran out bullets and surrendered to officers who had started hunting him. Edited by R.Wamochie
