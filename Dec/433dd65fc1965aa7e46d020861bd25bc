A 49-year-old man who was found cultivating bhang in the middle of a coffee plantation in his Embu farm has been jailed for a year or pay a Sh30,000 fine. Isaak Njogu pleaded guilty to growing prohibited plants at Kithiga village in Embu North subcounty contrary to narcotic and psychological substances control law before resident magistrate Jean Ndengeri. Some 18 plants of bhang were uprooted from his farm on December 6. Njogu pleaded for leniency, saying he has never been arrested, held or convicted with any other offense and that he will never repeat the crime he had committed. He also argued that he was the sole breadwinner to his family and if, jailed it would suffer a lot. The magistrate said she had considered his mitigation of being a first offender and his repentance and because he did not waste the court's time. Since he did not secure the fine, he was taken to Embu prison. The court was told that police officers at Kibugu police post were given a tip-off that the convict was growing bhang in his farm and laid an ambush.
