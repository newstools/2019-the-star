The number of visitors to the Hell's Gate National Park in Naivasha has dropped by 30 per cent in the last four months. The drop has been attributed to the closure of a popular gorge following the deaths, by flash floods, of seven people four months ago. The Kenya Wildlife Services is however optimistic that this will change once all the safety measures are put in place and the gorge reopened early next year. KWS Central Rift assistant director Aggrey Maumo said among the safety measures taken include the creation of escape routes, early warning systems and sirens to warn visitors in advance. “We have also embarked on training of all the tour guides on how to study weather patterns as the last incident was caused by floods after rains in areas upstream,” he said. Maumo told the Star that other parts of the park remained open to visitors mainly during the festive season when the number was expected to rise. “Apart from rock climbing, we have horse and bicycle riding and camping around the park which are are very popular,” he said. A Maasai community leader Jackson Ole Senchu said that due to the closure of the gorge close to 80 tour guides and traders had lost their jobs. Senchu said that the community fully supported the ongoing safety measures being put in place because the deaths of the seven had left them shaken. “Among those who lost their jobs were men and women involved in selling traditional wares to tourists and we hope all will be well once the gorge is reopened,” he said. The accident came seven years after a similar incident left seven youths from PCEA Nairobi dead. The youths were also swept by the floods while on an excursion in the same gorge.
