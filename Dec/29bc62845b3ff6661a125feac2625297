Public service vehicles in Nanyuki town and its environs have maintained normal fares to various destinations in and outside Laikipia county since the start of Christmas festivities. A spot check at various bus stages in the town indicated that the situation remained unchanged, possibly because there were only a few passengers traveling from the town. Nanyuki Cabs, Nanaiso and Nyakati Sacco matatus operating from Nanyuki to Nairobi charged Sh500 and Sh450 respectively. The 4 NTE Sacco which is a major passenger transport service along the Nyahururu-Nakuru highway charged Sh450 to Nakuru town and Sh350 to Nyahururu town, while fare from Nanyuki-Meru was retained at Sh300. At the same time, passengers headed to Karatina paid the usual Sh250. Meanwhile, business activities in the town remained low on Christmas Day, but on Thursday normal life began returning slowly with an increased number of people and vehicles within the town. Some of the shops which remained closed on Christmas Day opened but the number of customers remained low.
