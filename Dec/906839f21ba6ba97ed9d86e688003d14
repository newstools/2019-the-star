Former students of the collapsed Kenya Institute of Science and Technology in Kisii have sought government help after they failed to graduate. They suspect the proprietors conned them out of their money and time after enrolling them for courses. The 100 students said they had even paid for their graduation days to a planned ceremony in 2017, only for the college to close up shop. They filed complaints with Directorate of Criminal Investigations offices in Kisii with the hope that they will get justice. They held a street demo before addressing journalists and demanding that those behind their plight be punished. Gladys Samuel told The Star that they had been in the dark since. She said nobody picks their calls when they seek answers. They have also learnt that the college had no partnership with the University of Eldoret as had been claimed. "When we joined this college, we were told the institute had a collaboration with the university," said Peter Gichana, who studied Business Management. Samuel added, "We stayed duped all through and we fell into a warped story only meant to con us," Samuel said. Efforts by The Star to get comments from former administrators were unsuccessful. They did not return calls or respond to text messages. Kisii county police commander Martin Kibet said detectives will carry out investigations. (Edited by F'Orieny)
