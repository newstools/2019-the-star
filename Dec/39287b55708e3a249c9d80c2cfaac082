Toyota Kenya Limited has handed over three new vehicles to Radio Africa Group in a new partnership. The vehicles included two Rav 4 new models and a Suzuki Swift all worth Sh11,720,000. All the vehicles were manufactured in 2019. Toyota Kenya managing director Arvinder Reel said that each of the Rav 4s costs Sh5,010,000 while the Suzuki Swift is worth Sh1.7 million. “Thank you very much, we are humbled to be in this partnership with Radio Africa Group,” Reel said. Reel spoke during an event to hand over the vehicles to Radio Africa Group’s CEO Patrick Quarcoo at the Toyota Kenya showroom along Mombasa Road on Friday. Quarcoo was accompanied by Radio Africa Group radio presenters Maina Kageni, Andrew Kibe, Kamene Goro, and Ndhlovu. All the vehicles were branded with KISS 100 logos. They will be used by the radio station. Reel lauded RAG for choosing to do business with Toyota Kenya. “It’s a great opportunity for us, thank you very much,” Reel said. Quarcoo said that Toyota Kenya had made it easier for Kenyans to own new vehicles. “With Sh35,000 you can have a new car from Toyota Kenya.  The company has made cars more accessible,” Quarcoo said. He added, “Thanks for partnering with us, it is a great honour to work with your exciting team and wonderful products.” Quarcoo said he first interacted with Suzuki Swiss in India where he enjoyed using its cabs. “I asked who owned this thing and was told to go to Toyota Kenya. Kenya needs brand new things. We will move forward with you to promote new cars,” he added. Reel said that Toyota Kenya is running a promotion where clients will get a Sh100,000 discount on any car bought. He said the Christmas offer applies to all their cars on stock which includes Rav 4, Rush, Fortuner, Swift, Vitara, and Ertiga. Other offers, he said, were a full tank of fuel and 95 per cent financing from NCBA with one-month comprehensive insurance.
