Wazee meet Wanachopa in the first semifinal of the seventh edition of the annual Sir Charles Oppong Buchere tournament in Khwisero, Kakamega County today. In the second, Simba lock horns with defending champions Leeds at the Emulunya Primary School grounds. Wanachopa, comprised of motorbike riders, cruised to the semis after beating Corinthians FC 3-1 on post-match penalties after the encounter had ended as a goalless draw. Leeds reached the last four through a fourth-minute strike by Peter Mukono while Wazee progressed after a 3-1 win over tournament favourites Misango Red Stars. It was a dominant display by Wazee, who put their opponents to the sword with their menacing striker Brandon Okiru capping in a fine performance by hitting a brace in the 34th and 54th minutes after a Charles Besaâ€™s rasping strike had given them an early lead. The stunned Misango Red Stars could only manage a late consolation with Joseph Milimu sliding one into the net from a rebound. Simba booked their spot in the semifinals after seeing off their bitter rivals Kisa All Stars 4-3 on post-match penalties after playing out to a barren draw in normal time. The final will be staged on Wednesday.
