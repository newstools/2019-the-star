Eighty youth groups in Embu county will benefit from pressure car washing machines to reduce unemployment, Woman Representative Jane Wanjuki has said. The machines will be provided by the National Government Affirmative (NGAAF). Wanjuki, who was presenting the first 20 such machines at Kairuri in Embu North sub-county on Saturday, said the equipment will be distributed equitably in the four sub-counties. The beneficiaries will be boda boda taxi operators who are expected to employ at least one person to operate the machines. Each of the machines cost Sh50,000 and do not require electricity to operate. The provision of car washing machines idea is Wanjuki's brainchild. She said she was saddened to see many school, college and university leavers wallowing in poverty. She said hand-outs to the youths from politicians did not help in poverty reduction, adding that finding income-generating projects for them was the way out. “After thinking hard and seeking views from my advisers and the local people l found it fit to 'enable the youth to fish' by providing them with these pressure car-wash machines instead of 'giving them fish'  (handouts) which are of no long-term benefit,” Wanjuki said. The woman rep was concerned that many small-scale traders worked in the open without shelter and promised to initially provide 150 shelters. She has been giving out avocado seedlings to farmers for both domestic use and income generation.  She promised to provide 120 youth groups with chicks. Another of her income-generating proposals is the provision of local self-help groups with tents and plastic chairs for hire.
