A week after ruling the Nyaribari Masaba cross countr, Dickson Simba and his wife Teresa Omosa are now targeting top honours in the Safaricom Kisumu 10km road on December 15 in Kisumu City. The Kisumu event was scaled down from marathon due to reduced sponsorship. Simba and Omosa who spoke from their training camp at Mochenwa Camp in Nyamira County, however, admitted that the Kisumu race will be tough. Simba who has a personal best of 61:36 in half marathon and 27:16 in 10kms said: “This has been a good year for me. I ran my best times in 10km and half marathon. I want to crown the season with a win in Kisumu. The Kisumu course will be a bit challenging because it's flat and I train on a hilly high altitude area.” He will, however, face his nemesis Edwin Mokua who finished second in the Nyaribari Masaba race. “I traveled to Kisii on Sunday and arrived at 1 am but next week, I think my body will be in good shape and I hope to win in Kisumu,” said Mokua. On her part, Omosa said she will use the Kisumu race to prepare for road races in Italy next year. “It will be my second race after returning from maternity. I'm happy my body is responding well since I participated in the Getacho race on Monday. I'm looking forward to a challenging race on Sunday,” said Omosa. At the same time, organisers have announced the prize money for the race. Winners in both categories will walk home with Sh100,000 while runners up will get Sh50, 000. Top ten athletes will also receive cash awards
