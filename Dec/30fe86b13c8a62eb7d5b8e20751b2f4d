It’s a double victory for former Citizen TV reporter Hussein Mohammed after he received a Presidential award on the day of his graduation. The journalist received the Moran of the Burning Spear award on Friday. He also graduated with a Masters in Diplomacy and International Studies from the University of Nairobi. Individuals who receive presidential awards are recognised for outstanding or distinguished service rendered to the nation in various capacities and responsibilities. Awards are made by the president upon the advice of a National Honours and Awards Committee in the president’s office. Among other notable people who won state awards are Citizen TV sports reporter Mike Okinyi. Also on the list of recipients of the Head of State commendation is Zighe Joyce Msafwari, better known as Bi Msafwari, a key figure on Citizen TV’s Nipashe Wikendi show. The official list was published in a Gazette notice dated December 20.
