The FKF National Super League (NSL) enters the first round penultimate stage with runaway leaders Nairobi City Stars going neck to neck with Administration Police at Camp Toyoyo. With two matches to go in the first leg, City Stars under Sanjin Alagic remain the only unbeaten side in the league after 17 games and are favourites to win against 15th placed Administration Police. City Stars sponsored by the Jonathan Jackson Foundation will conclude their first-round games next weekend against Bottom of the table Kibera Black Stars. Alagic was tasked to ensure the club returns to the top-flight league. Last weekend City Stars saw off St Joseph’s Youth while AP drew 1-1 with Talanta. Fourth-placed Vihiga United will seek to close the gap on the top three teams when the Geoffrey Okoth charges travel to Kianyaga stadium to tackle Fortune Sacco. Ushuru will be away at Serani Sports Club to play struggling Modern Coast Rangers while Kibera Black Stars and Talanta will clash at Camp Toyoyo in a late kick-off. Administration Police Service Bomet will entertain Paul Ogai’s Coast Stima at Narok Stadium with St Joseph’s Youth hosting Murang’a Seal at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru. Tomorrow (Sunday) Shabana FC will play fifth-placed Migori Youth at Gusii Stadium targeting to arrest a poor run of five games without a win. Shabana coach Andrew Kanuli has been away the whole week attending to his sick mother. In his absence, former defender Vincent Nyaberi has been training the struggling at Cardinal Otunga High School, Mosocho. Second-placed Nairobi Stima and fourth-placed Bidco United will square it out at Karuturi Sports ground in Naivasha.
