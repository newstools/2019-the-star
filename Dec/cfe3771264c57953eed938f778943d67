Close to eight players are considering ditching National Super League side Murang'a Seal, according to coach David Mahira. The coach said the financial quagmire the club finds itself in is the reason most of their players have set their sights on moves elsewhere. The coach was, however,  unwilling to name the players until a final decision has been made. “The truth is we cannot keep players here if we have nothing to offer them in terms of payment yet they need to take care of their responsibilities. I can confirm eight of our key players have revealed their intention to leave and there is nothing we can do to hold them back,”Mahira said. The club has punched above their weight in their maiden season in the NSL but Mahira was now worried that they may struggle to maintain their current status if the circumstances remain the same ahead of the  transfer window. “We have to adjust our target for the campaign to just retaining our place in the NSL. Losing key players in this tough league is not something easy,” he said. “If things don’t change in terms of availability of funds, we will have to look for players locally (Murang’a) who may not need financial incentives because it will be easier for them to focus on football. But as you know, that will mean we settle for diminished quality to compete in the NSL,” conceded Mahira. Seal are eighth in the NSL table with 26 points from the first leg which ended with their 4-1 win over free-falling Administration Police.
