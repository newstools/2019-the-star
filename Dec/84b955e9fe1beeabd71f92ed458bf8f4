Vihiga Bullets have set their sights on a strong finish as they target promotion when the National Super League resumes in January. The upstarts dodged a bullet over the weekend when they came from two goals down in the first half to share  spoils with Mount Kenya United. “We had a shaky start to the match but we improved in the second half. Had we taken our chances, we could have emerged victorious,”observed assistant coach Milton Kidiga. Bullets are 12th on the NSL log with 21 points and face Migori Youth next in Awendo this weekend. Kidiga said the return of coach Edward Manoah to the bench after a period out convalescing bodes well for the team. “We lost our way a little bit when the coach (Manoah) was away recovering from illness. Since he returned, our results have been good—three wins and two draws. We hope to maintain this level for the rest of the campaign and see where it leads us,”said the former Mahakama and Chemelil Sugar striker. Unbeaten Nairobi City Stars continue to lead the standings with 43 points after their 3-1 drubbing of our of sorts Administration Police on Saturday. Anthony 'Muki' Kimani produced a man of the match display assisting all the three goals for the NSL leaders scored by David Gateri, Oliver Maloba and right back Kevin Okumu.
