A 15-day vaccination campaign against Rift Valley fever in Wajir targets up to 500,000 animals. The drive being undertaken in Wajir South, Wajir West, Eldas and Wajir North subcounties is a collaboration between the county and Save the Children. Livestock and Agriculture executive Ahmed Bulle said the exercise will protect the animals agiainst the disease and safeguard household food security. Bulle spoke on Wednesday in Habaswein subcounty, Wajir South when he launched the vaccination drive. Recent heavy rains were welcomed by the farmers but have left a trail of destruction and losses including of livestock. The CEC said that the campaign is part of disease preparedness and lesson learnt from last year outbreak after the rains. Herders lost hundreds of their animals. Some of the diseases that come with the rain include foot and mouth disease, Rift Valley fever, anthrax and contagious caprine pneumonia. Bulle said the county heavily relies on livestock as a major source of revenue hence the exercise is key. Livestock farmers sell beef, milk and hides. “Livestock is the backbone of our economy. We will do everything possible to make sure that our farmers do not incur losses,” Bulle said. He said animal health service delivery is a key component of the livestock sector which greatly contributes to the local economy. The CEC said a team of vets have already been dispatched to the four subcounties and urged farmers to take their animals at the nearest vaccination centre. Last week, Governor Mohamed Abdi urged livestock farmers to take think of their occupation as serious business. Abdi said that despite the ever-changing weather patterns that pose a risk to farmers, the county will continue providing assistance. “ My administration has seriously invested in this sector because we know what it means to our people. We have bought enough drugs and facilities to test and treat these diseases,” the governor said. (edited by O. Owino)
