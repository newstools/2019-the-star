Kenya representatives Serani High School stormed the semi-finals after running over Botswana in the quarters in the second edition of the Copa Africa cup tournament. Kenya was beaten  3-1 in the opening match by Zimbabwe but an assured 3-0 display against Mozambique in the second match saw them proceed to the quarters. The prospect of retaining the title, home advantage and the crowd behind the team saw the hosts grind the all-important goal and meet Tanzania today in the semi-final. Kenya fielded the same line up that started against Mozambique with the attacking trio Okuku Leonard, Mwinyi Nassoro and Joel Elisha as coach Daniel Lenjo made his intentions known early in the match. Onyango Fredrick, Mohamed Mbaruk and Bilal Kibwana bossed the midfield as Imael Tobe guarded the post. Lenjo got his backline examination right with centre back paring Odhiambo Marcos and Aden Mohamed leading by example.  Hamisi Hamisi and Geofrey Baiba filled the fullback positions in a preferred 4-3-3 formation. Kenya's Onyango and Botswana's Busang Manson were booked for unsporting behaviour. Wanjohi Philip replaced Marcos in the only Kenyan substitution. Elsewhere, high-scoring pre-match favourites Uganda were eliminated by Tanzania after suffering a 6-2 loss. Uganda had scored a total of 15 goals in two matches prior to the match. The neighbours had beaten Namibia 11-2 and 4-0 respectively in a home and away format. Zambia and Zimbabwe will meet in an all-Southern Africa side in the semi-final  after winning their quarter-final matches in regulation time. Zambia demolished Angola 8-1 with striker Kuse Sifuwe scoring five goals. Mwansa Kennedy, Sawaisha Devis and Nkhoma Innocent were also on the score sheet. Zimbabwe got the better of Namibia with 3-1 victory. Lenjo will be happy with the result but a stern test awaits. Kenya should fancy their chances after Uganda was eliminated.
