Charity organisation HAART said it would sue the Kenyan government over failure to provide five women trafficked from India and Nepal for sexual exploitation with appropriate care after they were rescued. HAART Kenya said a decision to make the three Nepali and two Indian women rescued from a Nairobi bar in August stay and testify against their alleged traffickers had caused them psychological harm. After four months, the victims want to go home. They have become deeply traumatised and suicidal and some have been hospitalised. As this is going on, some crafty Kenyans have converted message parlours as porn dens. Young girls in Mombasa are being recruited to be paid a very small amount of money to do unholy things to men on live videos as the owners collect dollars from those people. Let the government investigate this and bring to book all those found culpable. The parents of these girls should also be found to explain what their underage daughters are doing out of school.
