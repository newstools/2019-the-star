Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has appealed against a decision to acquit Nakuru West MP Samuel Arama of charges of  illegal acquisition of land. Senior prosecutor Joseph Riungu told the High Court the magistrate erred in law by not considering the overwhelming  evidence on record. "The magistrate erred in law and fact by failing to properly consider the weight of the charges as against the evidence adduces," said Riungu said. He said in finding that the evidence adduced by the prosecution was insufficient to establish a case against Arama, the magistrate made an incorrect ruling. The DPP says the magistrate ignored the primary evidence of prosecution witness number six who testified that he never owned land in Nakuru and disowned the purported sale  agreement presented  by Arama who claimed to have  purchased the land from him. The state says the magistrate failed to consider that the prosecution had discharged its burden of proof by establishing its case beyond a reasonable doubt. On November 22,  Milimani anti-corruption chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti  acquitted Arama of graft charges for lack of evidence. In his ruling, the magistrate freed the legislator and two others saying the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the corruption charges against them. "I hereby acquit the three accused persons under Section 210 and order their cash bail of Sh1 million deposited in court to be refunded to them," Ogoti ruled. In June last year, the MP was charged with several counts of abuse of office, fraudulent acquisition of land in Nakuru and conspiracy to defraud a businessman. Arama is said to have conspired with four others to defraud Ahmed Muhammad Nisar by means of dispossessing him a plot of land between August 3 and August 11, 2015.
