The burial of the victims of landslide and floods in West Pokot county will start next Tuesday, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa has said. Addressing Christians at Immaculate Cathedral during a Kitale Catholic Diocesan fundraiser before heading to Pokot,Wamalwa said the government will fund funeral expenses. The cabinet secretary who was accompanied by Sigor MP Peter Lochaks said the Government has already bought iron sheets for each family for the construction of the new houses. "We want to ensure that immediately after the burial, the families should start construction of the new houses," Wamalwa said. Two weeks ago, the landslide and floods killed more than 43 people in the county. Lochaks said his constituency alone had 21 victims that died from the accident with seven being from the same family. He said the number of those who died might be higher than what was given by the government because some families are yet to get their loved ones. Wamalwa said his ministry has allocated sh.20 Million to construct Dykes around River Sabwani in Kwanza and another allocation has been earmarked for the same for River Malakisi in Teso. He said proper measures have been put in place to contain floods in Budalangi.
