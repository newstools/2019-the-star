Joseph Irungu alias Jowie who is facing a murder charge has sued the state and the commissioner of prisons for treating him in an inhuman way. In an application filed under urgency on Friday, Jowie asked the court to order the Commissioner of Prisons to escort him to Kiambu police station to report the incident where he was assaulted by prison officers. Jowie also wants the court to stop the state and the commissioner of prisons from subjecting him to inhumane and degrading treatment. He also wants to be escorted to Kiambu hospital for medical examination and filing a P3 form in respect to his assault. In court documents, Jowie says he was threatened to be killed by a Mr Lekulal who physically assaulted him with other officers at Kamiti maximum prison. There have been reports that Jowie was being transferred toÂ Manyani Maximum Security Prison in Voi. According to a senior officer who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, Jowie was transferred from Kamiti to Manyani prisons last Friday after he was found with contraband during a random search. Jowie will be spending his second Christmas behind bars as the court is set to rule on his bail application on February 13, 2020. Jowie was arrested on September 25 last year and spent Christmas in remand. In June 18, 2019, the High Court declined to grant Jowie bail for the second time. He and his former fiancee, Jacque Maribe, a former TV journalist are facing trial for the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani.
