Motorists within Central Business District can now breathe a sigh of relief as City hall has obeyed court orders and reversed parking fee charges from Sh 400 to the previous of Sh 200. In a notice dated December 9, it states that the changes will take effect as from Wednesday. Motorists in the CBD have been paying Sh400 as from last week despite a court order that stopped the increase until a case filed by the Consumer Federation of Kenya (Cofek) is determined. Director of Parking Tom Tinega on Tuesday said the county received the court order on Monday and changes were effected. “We instructed our  software providers and ICT department to adjust the parking fees from Sh400 to Sh200 daily as per the court order,” he said. Cofek had threatened to sue the county government once again for contempt of court. As directed by High Court Judge James Makau, the case will be heard on January 21, 2020
