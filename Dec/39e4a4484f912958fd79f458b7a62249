Kenya Cup have announced changes to kickoff times for tomorrow fixtures. According to a statement, five matches which were scheduled to start at 4 pm and the Ngong Road Derby which was set for 6pm will all start at 3pm. This means that the Eric Shirley Shield matches will start at 1pm. The changes are due to the heavy rains being witnessed in the country. The Kenya Cup match pitting Nondies and Nakuru which was to kick off at 4pm at Impala Club has also been moved to Nondies homeground-Jamhuri Park. “As a result, Saturday’s Kenya Cup and KRU Championship fixtures will all kick off at 3pm while the Eric Shirley Shield reserve league fixtures will now be played at 1pm,” read the statement. Last weekend's top-of-the-table clash between champions KCB and Kabras was temporarily halted due to torrential rains and KRU want to avoid a similar scenario. The match, in which Kabras beat KCB for the first time event in a 19-6 margin, had to be stopped in the 60th minute, with referee Victor Oduor calling it off altogether,  a decision accepted by both teams.
