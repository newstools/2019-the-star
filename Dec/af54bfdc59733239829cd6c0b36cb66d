Both national and county government representatives joined the family members at the home of the late vice-chairperson of the NCIC Fatuma Tabwara to pay their last respects. Tabwara who passed away on Sunday while attending a relative's wedding was buried on Monday at Kombani in Matuga, Kwale County. In attendance were NCIC commissioners, county commissioner Karuku Ngumo, Governor Salim Mvurya, Matuga MP Kassim Tandaza among others. On Sunday, President Uhuru Kenyatta described the late NCIC Vice-Chair as a great national leader and role model who was an outstanding champion of the rights of women and the girl-child, especially in Kwale County. Uhuru said Ms Tabwara will particularly be remembered for the role she played in the formulation of the sexual harassment policy in Kwale County. Mvurya recognised Tabwara as a great leader and an icon to the Kwale county community. Tabwara collapsed and died from a heart attack in her way to Diani Beach Hospital. She has left behind four children. The late NCIC vice-chairperson died at the age of 57. According to Ngumo, Tabwara is a peacemaker and has devoted her life in uniting the Kwale communities. Ngumo said she has known Tabwara as a hardworking woman. He said her selection as NCIC vice-chairperson was in no doubt. "To be honest the President of the Republic of Kenya didn't make a mistake by appointing her as a commissioner, because she really deserved it, " said Ngumo. Tandaza said the deceased had attended his son's wedding on Saturday morning and her death shook him by surprise. He said they had a long chat with Tabwara where she spoke about her new role. Mvurya told the local residents to embrace Tabwara's spirit of propagating peace and unity. He said to keep her legacy alive everyone must use harmony as a shield for prosperity. "It is hard to admit that she has gone but the most important thing is to fulfil her last wish and that is living peacefully as people and under the common accord, " said Mvurya.
