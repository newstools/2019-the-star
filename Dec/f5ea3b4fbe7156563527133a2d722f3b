Teachers marking Business Studies KCSE exam papers on Tuesday briefly downed their tools over low pay. The Star has learnt that the rates paid for marking the particular subject were lower compared to that of other papers prompting the standoff. The standoff involved markers at Machakos Girls High School and those at Starehe Girls where business Paper 2 and Paper 1 are being marked respectively. The standoff was however contained by mid-morning after an agreement to raise the marking rates from Sh46 to Sh57. However, sources indicate the teachers are still in contention over the agreement since it was verbal rather than written. On Tuesday, Mercy Karogo- - Kenya National Examination Council CEO told the Star the matter had been resolved amicably and the marking process resumed. KCSE exams came to a close on November 27. This year, 699,745 candidates sat for the KCSE. The exams started on October 21 with practical papers, while written papers began on November 4. The exams will be marked in about 20 marking centres in Nairobi.Some 26,997 examiners are expected to mark this yearâ€™s exams. Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha said the examination results will be released before Christmas celebration. Last year, KCSE results were released on December 21.
