A G4S guard who had just finished his night shift at Bank Of Africa on Saturday morning was hit by a motorist as he made his way home. A few metres from his work station on Karuna Close, a car making a turn off from Waiyaki Way swerved on to the curb and hit the guard as he was walking towards the bus stop. The car ended up in a ditch near St Mark Church. A witness who requested anonymity said, "It was around 6:30 am when Thomas Momanyi was leaving work when the car that was turning onto Karuna Close in high speed, cut the corner and couldn't brake fast enough and the motorist lost control and hit Thomas who was walking on the curb." The car, a Subaru was being driven by a man who was in the company of a woman. Momanyi's colleague, who also works for G4S, swung to action and ensured their colleague was rushed to Medanta Clinic for medical attention. He was later referred to Kenyatta National Hospital. Police from Parklands and Kabete stations arrived at the scene later. Momanyi reported the incident at Spring Valley police station under OB16/14/12/19/ at 11.20am.
