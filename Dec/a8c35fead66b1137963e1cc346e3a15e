Two wanted criminals were on Tuesday arrested by DCI Detectives following a tip-off by members of the public in Mombasa County. They are believed to have been terrorising residents of Likoni area. The two are Abdallah Rashid and Brian Ochieng, both 18 years of age. "They were nabbed in a raid when detectives received information that a group of six armed youths had assembled in an incomplete building in preparation to wreak havoc to members of the public," the DCI said through a tweet. DCI detectives recovered two pangas, two slashers, one sword and one metal bar upon a search of the said building. The suspects are to be arraigned today as the search for the ones who escaped continues. Last week, a suspected criminal was killed by police at Bamburi, Kisauni subcounty, and another by a mob in Likoni. The suspect was shot dead on December 3 after police ambushed a gang of eight with pangas. “This is the festive season and if we don’t do that, crime goes up. Mombasa has many visitors we don’t want our people to suffer,” subcounty police commander Julius Kiragu said
