Kwale chiefs have been ordered to take legal actions against parents who will not take their class eight candidates to form one, by the third week of January. Speaking on Thursday, while presiding over the Jamhuri Day celebration in Mkongani ward in Matuga, County commissioner Karuku Ngumo said the government is determined to achieve 100 per cent secondary school transition. He said no school-going children should be seen loitering around when the first term commences. Ngumo said parents should live up to their responsibilities and offer children the best education. “The only legacy you can leave behind for your sons and daughters is knowledge, so please make sure you have given your all," said Ngumo. He said if guardians can’t afford to enrol students to distant schools, they should consider registering them to nearby ones, he said. “The excuse that your child is remaining at home simply because he or she has been called for a boarding school that you can’t manage should stop and register them as day scholars in nearby institutions they are cheap and affordable,” he said.
