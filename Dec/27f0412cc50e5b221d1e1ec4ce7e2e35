Struggling Kenya Rugby Union Championship side Kisii will on Sunday celebrate their 10year anniversary at the Kisii Sports Club. The club, founded in 2009, had their best season in 2016-2017 — when they played in the Kenya Cup league before being relegated the following season. Club captain and team manager George Sagini said: “The main agenda will be celebrating 10 years since the club was founded. However, we shall also fundraise and as well conduct a membership drive.” The club has introduced a yearly membership fee of Sh1, 000, according to Sagini. “We hope to raise funds that will steer the club in the second leg, which starts in January. We have failed to honour three matches due to financial constraints. We are appealing to well-wishers to help us honour all our second-round games,” added Sagini. Following the walkovers, the bottom-placed club was docked six points to remain with just three from nine matches. Club treasurer Mogonchi Steve said: “We are in a tough financial situation at the moment. Our special appeal goes to well-wishers to help us honour our second leg games.” The club’s problems were compounded by the withdrawal of sponsors Resolution Insurance. Recently, club chairman Adrian Ongwae and Secretary Joseph Okong’o resigned to throw the club into further turmoil. Club coach Eric Bosire said failure to honour the three matches and lack of consistent training has affected the team’s performance. “We struggled in our last game against Northern Suburbs due to lack of match fitness,” said Bosire. Bosire now targets to win all the club’s home matches in the second leg in order to avoid relegation. “At the beginning of the season, our target was a playoff place but now that is not achievable. We now hope to avoid relegation,” added Bosire.
