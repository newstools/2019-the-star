Mwanaisha Chidzunga has started a YouTube initiative called Dada 2 Dada Uncensored. She told Word Is on Saturday, “Dada 2 Dada Uncensored will be focusing on women empowerment, motivation, mentorship and entrepreneurship. 2020 will be amazing for the Kenyan woman. Also, my hospitality business is doing very well and I thank God." Her move comes weeks after she left K24. “It was an amazing year. I worked for Mediamax for four years and I finally got an opportunity to say thank you and start doing my other things. My contract ended on November 1 as it was for four years from 2015," Chidzunga said. "I had a decision to renew it or not. So I had already made a decision not to. It’s just a matter of time. For me, life has to go on. There is more to life than just TV. I mean, there is the Internet, YouTube, all these things. “Then I’m always prepared. When one door closes a gate opens for you. For me, I’m always ready for the next opportunity. For me, it’s no big deal.” Chidzuga presented the Best Actor in a Film Category gong at the Kalasha Awards on Saturday. “There’s a lot of opportunity for Kenyans. Upcoming artistes and filmmakers should take advantage of the technology that we have. We need to shoot movies that can showcase what Kenya has to the world. It's a beautiful place to shoot movies.”
