Political leaders from Kisii and Nyamira counties yesterday said last month's census report was doctored and failed to reflect the current population of the region. In Nyamira, North Mugirango MP Joash Nyamoko said the report was not factual. "Looking at it from any standpoint, it doesn't add up," said Nyamoko. In Kisii, Bomachoge Chache and Nyaribari Masaba parliamentary hopefuls Abdalla Nyagaka and Dr Laban Chweya respectively also described the report as lacking truth, and possibly cooked up. "How does a constituency like Nyaribari Masaba register 2,000 people in census growth in an entire decade, I suspect there is something amiss in this," said Chweya. Abdalla too told the Star on phone that the report may had been cooked by census officials to deny the region resources. County Senator Prof Sam Ongeri, however, said the report showed exponential growth in the regions' population, and thus the need for more representation. He said across the two counties, two or three constituencies should be carved out to expand representation. "My strong opinion is that we still have constituencies with staggering populations like Bobasi in Kisii and Kitutu Masaba in Nyamira that should be be should halved into two each for broad representation," he told the Star on the phone. Bomachoge Chache MP Alpha Miruka said more resources should be channeled to the regions in the face of burgeoning population to help in development. He also said the region has now come of age to burgain for the national cake. Kisii registered 1.2 million in population growth according to the report. It added 200,000 people. "If we join hands as leaders from this region, we can influence national decisions," he said. In Nyamira, the population shot up to 605,576 people, an addition of about 8,000 people.
