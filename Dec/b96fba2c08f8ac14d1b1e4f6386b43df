Nondies centre Oscar Dennis has been ruled out of the Cape Town sevens slated for this weekend. Dennis suffered a broken jaw in Dubai while playing for Kenya in the preliminary match against England. Dennis will be out for two months recovering from the jaw and will most certainly miss the Hamilton and Sydney Sevens in late January as he recovers. Dennis will be replaced by Kabras back-row Dan Sikuta for the event in Cape Town. Shujaa arrived in Cape Town on Monday and had a light training session  yesterday as they step up preparations for the opening match against Samoa tomorrow. Team manager Eric Ogweno said the team is upbeat about the chances in Pool 'D' where they also face Australia and Ireland. “It's a chance for us to regroup and look at winning two games in the pool and ensuring we qualify for the quarterfinals,”added Ogweno. He termed Samoa a physical outfit who will play to their strengths.  "The pacific Islanders reached the semis last weekend in Dubai and are expected to be formidable. Australia and Ireland are smart tactical teams and we have to be at our best to match them,” he added. Shujaa picked four points from the opening leg in Dubai last weekend, winning one match against Scotland in the classification match for 13 and 14 position. Ogweno admitted that the new format where the Challenge trophy has been scrapped, qualification to the main cup quarters has become competitive. “There are no easy teams and teams are using the world series for the Olympics next year. As a team, we have to reduce our errors and execute well in both attack and defence,” added Ogweno. Ogweno said Shujaa have adjusted to the hot conditions in both Dubai and Cape Town. "The team has adapted well to the conditions and we are relishing the challenge of playing this weekend," he added.
