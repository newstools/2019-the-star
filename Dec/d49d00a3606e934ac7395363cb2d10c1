The government has been urged to use talents among youths to fight social evils and promote peace and national cohesion. Dynamic Youth Mentorship Group chairman Macharia Muraguri said talents can be used to fight violent extremism, alcoholism, drug abuse and crime. DYMG is an organisation that mentors youths. This, Muraguri said, can be done through the use of music, acting, modeling, art and fashion design, among others. The talents, he noted, can also be used as a way of income generation for the youth. Muraguri spoke during a youth’s talent show dubbed Imarisha Vijana Mtaani in Othaya town on Saturday. "Though young people have various talents, they lack forums and opportunities to showcase them, have not gotten a chance for the past few years to show what they can do," he said. The event brought together about 500 youths from Othaya subcounty, with 70 exhibiting various talents. “There are very innovative people who have prepared work of art but lack a forum to showcase and even market their work. We plan to be holding such an event annually to enable them to tap and even help them nurture the talents,” he said. “We also want to give those who have nothing to showcase morale so that if they think they have a  certain talent, then they can have the courage and morale to try and showcase what they can and do better the next time,” he said. After the competitions, the youth were given various awards with the climax of the event being the crowning of Mr and Miss Othaya.
