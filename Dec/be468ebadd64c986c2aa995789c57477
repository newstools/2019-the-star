 Pharmaceutical quacks are behind the stealing of drugs in public hospitals which they later sell in their private chemists, the Kenya Pharmaceutical Association has said. KPA secretary-general Peter Mogere asked the public to ensure they buy drugs from registered and licensed chemists to reduce theft of medicine from hospitals. "Kenyans are getting poor services because of corruption and many pharmaceutical quacks on the ground who steal and dispense the drugs without instructions," Mogere said. "Make sure you know the name of the pharmacist and confirm with the working certificate placed on the wall." Mogere asked county governments to work with the Pharmacy and Poisons Board to ensure Kenyans get quality healthcare services. He decried employment of quacks by counties, saying they were causing health hazards and hindering the realisation of President Uhuru Kenyatta's Big Four agenda.
