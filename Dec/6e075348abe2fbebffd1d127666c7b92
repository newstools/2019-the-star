Harambee Starlets players Janet Moraa, Ruth Ingotse, Dorcas Shiveka and Annette Kundu are expected to play a key role for Eldoret Falcons in the inaugural Eldoret seven-a-side soccer tournament today at Hill School, Eldoret. Goalkeeper Kundu, who kept goal as Starlets romped to the Cecafa women's title in Tanzania, without conceding a goal, will be among the main attractions alongside her international teammates of striker Moraa and midfielder Ingotse . The tournament dubbed 'Mental Wellness' will see 30 teams compete for six titles in various categories as they celebrate Jamhuri Day in style. Falcons chairman Joshua Ariko said the team is well prepared following their second-place finish during the Malkia tournament played last weekend in Kilifi. “We played very well in Kilifi and we want to replicate the same at home. Playing at home gives us an opportunity to gauge our players ahead of the new season,” said Ariko. In Kilifi, Falcons finished second behind Moving The Goal Post after going down 2-0. “ We learnt many lessons from the event and we hope to perform better this time," he said. Falcons finished in 10th position in the Premier League that was won by Vihiga Queens for the third time in a row. Out of their 26 matches, Falcons won six, drew five and lost 15  for accumulative  30 points.
