The Kenya National Paralympics Committee wants government to increase funding for Para-sports in a bid to accommodate upcoming talent for posterity. KNPC president Agnes Oluoch said the future of para-sports in Kenya is not certain given that most of the upcoming sportsmen and women who are unclassified are never factored in in overseas trips. She said classification is everything when it comes to international competitions and without that talents will always go untapped. "In our (para-sports) case, athletes have to be classified by each sports' international federation and if we do not present them at the world competitions they will never be categorised. Consequently, they will never showcase their talent out there," she said. “If we do not enter them in international events where they will be classified, we will continue to have the same faces over the years and a vacuum will no doubt be be created when they retire,” said Oluoch. The official also said they will get down to discovering more talented girls and boys in 2020 as long as they are given the opportunity to get classified. “We will go to the grassroots to discover and tap raw talents and attach them to various teams and coaches for development. We have good athletes but we lack the right and adequate equipment for training,” added Oluoch. She particularly pointed out the lack of the right wheelchairs for racing and basketball. Oluoch said there are other sports disciplines like para-rowing and canoeing which in addition to equipment, accessing facilities is difficult for competitors.
