Hulda Adhiambo Serro, well known to many by just Serro, has released a love ballad called 'Aheri', a tale about a relationship riddled with broken promises. “A lot of relationships change after two people have been together for a while,” she said. "It‘s easy for partners to start focusing on things like children and forget about each other, but there’s always hope if they choose to work on rejuvenating the romance they once had." She is famed for her song "Kasyoki wa Mitumba" and is set to debut her album 'Kuwe' in 2020, a collaborative project with Mutoriah. Her trademark is Benga and Jazz-meshed Afro-soul sounds, laced with traditional Kenyan folk instrumentation.
