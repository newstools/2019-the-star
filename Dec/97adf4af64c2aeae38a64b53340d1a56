@OmbimaPatrick. Vihiga Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi has said that some clauses in the BBI report should be amended to favour both the political class and the public at large. He said though they fully support the report, the public should be given the power to decide who to lead them. His remarks are targeting the part in the BBI report which states that the governor should be deputised by a person from the opposite gender. “Let’s not be conditioned on who will be your running mate, just give free space for those contesting to choose their deputies based on the political muscles they have,” Saisi said. He spoke to the press yesterday morning in his office. Saisi said women should fight for their positions and create their own ground to serve the public rather than being imposed on the public. "We have seen powerful ladies who have made it in politics. They have even rattled men so badly in politics. These women include Charity Ngilu [Kitui Governor], Anne Waiguru [Kirinyaga Governor], Martha Karua [former MP and ex-minister], among other powerful women,” Saisi said. He added that even nominations should be done on merits and value addition to a particular party. “Most cases parties just nominate people on a friendly level without considering those who fought for the party,” Saisi said.
