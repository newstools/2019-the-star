Eric Omondi's ex-girlfriend Chantal Grazioli is back to the country for Christmas after they announced that they had broken up months ago. "Don’t kill yourself or physically hurt people because you are separating or can’t be together anymore. It’s never really that serious," Omondi advised on Instagram. "The people you meet in your life are precious, they may leave today and be back in the future or never at all. "Chantal and I were the best of friends before anything else and that will never change."
