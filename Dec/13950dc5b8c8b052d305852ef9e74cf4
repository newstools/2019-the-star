Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o wants collective efforts to reduce global warming effects. Prof Nyong’o expressed concern that the country is faced with serious global challenges, including global warming, which requires the attention of all nations. He said a multi-agency approach was crucial in handling the rampant effects of global warming and be able to make the country and the world food-sufficient. “The adverse effects of climate change continue to virtually affect literally everybody in the world in increasingly severe ways and I urge for the involvement of all nations to reverse the trend,” he said. The governor added: “Climate change is a reality and its effects are already here with us. The extent of each consequence depends on our collective choices, making it one of the most urgent issues facing humanity today.” Speaking in Kisumu, Nyong'o announced of plans by his administration in partnership with the National Government to construct a four kilometre dyke along river Nyando as a lasting mitigation measure to the recurrent floods menace. “The county government will also undertake other short-term interventions including de-silting and erecting embankments along river beds in flood prone areas,” he said. Other efforts the county chief said included the creation of a county disaster coordinating team to ensure a more harmonised response structure. Others include distribution of food and non-food items, organised medical camps, as well as creating awareness to sensitise locals on what they need to do when faced with the menace. So far, more than 10,000 families have been affected, with four lives lost as a result of the flood water.
