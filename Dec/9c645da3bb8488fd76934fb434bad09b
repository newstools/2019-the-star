A 25-year-old security guard was charged on Monday with defiling his sister-in-law at his rented house in Kiambiu village, Eastleigh, Nairobi. Lazarus Nyasaka, an employee of Hatari Security firm, is accused of sexually assaulting the minor on December 8 after his wife left him with her siblings. He was also charged with engaging in an indecent act with the minor. Nyasaka denied the charges before Makadara senior principal magistrate Angelo Githinji. The court heard that he took advantage of his wife’s absence to commit the offence. The victim and her younger brother had been left in his custody. According to a police file, Nyasaka sent the girl to a nearby butchery before telling the brother to leave him the house. Upon return, the victim found Nyasaka alone. He sent her to warm tea for him. He then accosted and dragged her to his bed where he defiled her. The brother-in-law returned and knocked on the door while he was still in the act. He immediately let go of the girl and proceeded to open the door for the boy. The girl sat outside the house until her sister came back. She informed her of her ordeal. The matter was reported to the police, investigations initiated and Nyasaka arrested. He was granted Sh500,000 bond. The case is set for hearing on April 15. (Edited by F'Orieny)
