A 27-year-old man who had gone to harvest sand in Gimini village, Budalang’i constituency, was buried alive on Thursday afternoon after a quarry caved in. The incident that occurred at Abwoga sand quarry. This is the third incident in a span of one year.  Barely a week ago, a middle-aged man died when he was buried alive while harvesting sand at the same site. Sand harvester Andrew Abwoga told the Star Klegan Otieno from Bondo subcounty in Siaya county, defied advice not to resume sand harvesting after the rains stopped. Abwoga said they had spotted some cracks at the site. The drive to retrieve the body, led by  former councillor Samuel Juma Magoba and the coordinator of Bunge Charles Goma, lasted over an hour. Leaders from Bunyala subcounty have urged the government to take effective steps to prevent deaths resulting from sand harvesting.
