Over the last five years, cycling has gained traction on the streets of Nairobi and its environs. The Grand Nairobi Bike Race on Sunday was a boon to cyclists, ranging from children, recreational and professional cyclists, who took to the streets of Nairobi. The event encourages participation from cyclists through corporate teams racing, as well as serving as an opportunity for elite, professional, amateur and recreational cyclists within the sport to compete against some of the best cyclists from the region.
