AFC Leopards' branches have been asked to raise a minimum of Sh20,000 in a bid to bail out the financially struggling club. Leopards alongside their traditional rivals Gor Mahia were rendered sponsor-less in August after betting firm SportPesa closed shop in Kenya, citing unfavourable business environment. Gilbert Andugu, head of AFC Leopards' branches chairmen, challenged fans through their branches to adopt the ‘Mission Possible Initiative’ and raise funds to cater for the players’ salaries. The club recently parted ways with their Rwandese centre-half Soter Kayumba due to lack pay and on Monday, reports emerged that versatile midfielder Wyvonne Isuza was also keen to follow suit. “We want to maintain all our best players who are all good. However, this will only work well if we support the team with whatever little we have. “ I am so grateful to our fans who supported the team in our recent matches against Bandari and Nzoia Sugar. It’s a sacrifice and such support cannot go without appreciation. “We are optimistic of better days ahead and we would urge each and everyone to remain patient including our players. We are aware of what they are currently going through and we are glad this has not affected the performance,” he said. He urged each and every individual to come out and support the team including all the leaders, saying the team requires their support if they are to maintain good performance. Andugu, who is also the chairman of the Mombasa branch, revealed that the current crop of players in the team have blended well and need to be maintained.
