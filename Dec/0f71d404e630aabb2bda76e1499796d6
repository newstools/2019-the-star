The families of two G4S Security Company staff will usher in the New Year with their loved ones after they spent the Christmas holiday behind bars. Mombasa senior principal magistrate Vincent Adet declined to have Wyclife Ngava Wambua and Ogero Robin Mogaka detained by the DCI after spending five days in police custody. The duo was arrested on December 23 after they were caught on camera breaking into and stealing computers from the Kenya Ports Authority Accounts office inside the Mombasa port. Wambua and Mogaka are guards at the KPA Accounts office where six Lenovo Central Processing Units (CPUs) and two HP laptops were stolen following the break-in. On Friday, the prosecution sought to have the DCI detain them for a further seven days to complete their investigations. But the suspects, through their lawyer Lucy Hakika, opposed this, saying the application lacked merit as the police had sufficient time to investigate. Prosecutor Ngina Mutua made the application arguing that the suspects were arrested towards the Christmas celebration and investigating officer Joel Mwaniki had no time to complete his investigation due to the festivities. The court, however, ruled against detaining the guards, saying it would be a violation of their constitutional rights after spending five days in police custody. Instead, Adet released them on a cash bail of Sh30,000 with an alternative of a Sh50,000 surety. He said the two should report to the Mombasa port DCI office on January 3. They will take plea upon completion of the investigations.
