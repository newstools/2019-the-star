The Sh90,000 rent arrears case against former Lang'ata MP Joash Olum has been withdrawn. The company that sued him on Tuesday withdrew the case, saying he had cleared the rent arrears. Olum had been charged in a Kibera court with failing to pay Sh90,000 rent. Olum, the prosecution says, on 30 September at Sedco Constructions Limited in Kileleshwa gave out a cheque for Sh90,000 but the cheque bounced because his account had no money. It was meant to settle rent owed to Sedco Constructions Ltd. He denied the charges before Kibera senior principal magistrate Boaz Ombewa. The magistrate had earlier cancelled his police bail after he failed to appear in court. His lawyer requested the court to lift the warrant. On Tuesday, the former legislator came to court with the company officials and withdrew the case. The company made an application to court to be allowed to drop the case, saying Olum had managed to clear the rent arrears.
