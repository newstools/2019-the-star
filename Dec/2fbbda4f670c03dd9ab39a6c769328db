 Health services in Kisumu have ground to a halt after the county government failed to honour a return to work formula it signed with doctors in June. The doctors had issued a 14-day strike notice on November 21 through the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union. The notice ended on Friday. The medics' grouses with their employer include promotions, NHIF cover, non-remittances of statutory deductions and study leave. The doctors, through their Nyanza branch chairman Kevin Osuri, at the weekend accused the county government of playing games and being dishonest. Osuri said the document signed in June gave the timelines for their promotions and pay increases. This is the second time in a year that the doctors have resorted to strike action. They resumed work in June with mere promises and nothing on the table. The county government had in the return to work agreement announced that it had allocated Sh250 million to spend on promotions, an exercise that was to be concluded by  September 1. Osuri said they will not resume duty until the Collective Bargaining Agreement addressed conclusively. Two weeks ago, their branch secretary Omweri Lameck accused the county of failure to respond to their October 28 demand letter on the pertinent matters. “The union is right in her assertion that the county government of Kisumu is a hostile employer engaged in illegal subversion of workers' rights," he said. Last week, the union sued the Governor Anyang' Nyong'o-led government for failure to adhere to the CBA. The matter is set for mention tomorrow (Tuesday) at the Labour Court. Kisumu clinical officers are on their third week of strike.  The doctors' work stoppage further puts health services in jeopardy. Several people died due to lack of medical attention when the caregivers went on strike mid this year over the same issues.
