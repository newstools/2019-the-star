Singer Vivian says she was conned by a music producer after he refused to do the work he was paid for. "It happened as part of being in the industry. There is a Kenyan producer that is really popular," she said. "Three years ago. We paid him to do a song and a deposit for the next song. He called us and said he wasn't going to do the song, neither was he going to send back the money." Adding, "I thought maybe he has a mental condition because who does that? I didn't think about taking him to the police, I thought about finding him help." Vivian said this on the 'Janjaruka' series.
