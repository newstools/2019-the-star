TheÂ  Presbyterian University of East Africa (PUEA) will be issued with a charter after undergoing a rigorous accreditation process. The Commission for University Education said the charter will be awarded soon. Grace Njoroge who is in charge of administration and finance at CUE said the private institution had met all the requirements. She spoke on Friday at PUEA during the university's 10th graduation ceremony when 647 graduands were awarded degrees, diplomas and certificates. Nominated Senator Beth Mugo who was the chief guest said, "I want to commend PUEA as one university that has a very inspiring story since its inception to this far it has come. You have fought battles and won. You have made tremendous strides and I am sure this will culminate in the issuance of your university charter in the very near future." PUEA chancellor Julius Mwamba said the institution attracts students at both undergraduate and graduate levels. It maintains an ecumenical Christian tradition, where acquisition of knowledge and skills is guided by Christian values. Vice chancellor John Mungania said that the population of students in the university had steadily grown to 2,500, half of them government-sponsored. He assured the graduates that their degrees would be recognized and challenged them to join the labour market as ambassadors of the institution. Mungania said that the university had applied for the charter after meeting all the requirements as stipulated in the Education Act 2012 and was now waiting for the CUE to fully accredit it. "We have gone through all the processes and are now waiting for accreditation and the issue is now in the hands of CUE and as you well know, you can not accelerate the process, hence we have no option but to wait," he said.
