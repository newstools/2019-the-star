Food hawking in Kisii town has been banned to avert disease outbreak. Those caught violating the directive risk being fined between Sh3,000 and Sh5,000 or two months in jail. Kisii County Municipality director Mengo Ochwang’i warned that those who will violate the directive risk arrest and prosecution “We are going to take stern action against those who cook and hawk food. We have taken the step to avoid an outbreak of diseases,” Ochwang’i told the Star in Kisii. The director said county’s enforcement officers have launched a crackdown on hawkers to enhance sanity and hygiene in the town. The crackdown will extend to next year. “The hawkers have no medical certificates or food licenses. Many of them have no uniforms and cook and sell food in unhygienic conditions,” he added. Municipality Public Health Officer Hezron Omayio said hawkers found culpable will be fined between Sh3,000 and Sh5,000 depending on the counts or be jailed for a month or two. Omayio said some hawkers cook food at home and sell it to unsuspecting consumers. Others cook in the streets. “Every corner has been reduced to an eatery. Consumers are not aware of the dangers they are exposing their lives to since they do not know how the food is cooked,” Omayio said. He appealed to consumers to eat at licensed eateries, adding that this will help them complain in case of food poisoning. Ochwang’i also said vegetable vendors sell their wares along roads and streets, which endangers their lives in case of accidents. He also warned residents against constructing kiosks on top of the drainage system. “It is unlawful to construct kiosks on drainages. It clogs them, hampers the planning and movement of people. I have given them a week to demolish and remove the kiosk or the county demolishes them,” the director said.
