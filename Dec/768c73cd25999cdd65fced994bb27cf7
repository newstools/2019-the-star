More than 5,000 people who had illegally settled in Kirisia forest, Samburu, have volunteered to vacate. This is after a community bordering the forest at Tamiyoi area through their forest association worked with Kenya Forest Service to persuade and convince people out of the forest through several meetings with elders. The illegal settlers asked the government to support them so they can acquire tree seedlings to replant parts of the forest that were destroyed. Some of the families have left, while others are demolishing their houses as they transport property to their previous homes. They have given themselves up to Saturday so all can relocate. Kenya Forest Service county enforcement commander Geofre Okeyo said his office will support the community to punish those who would have flouted the community's directive. "Even after the community has made that decision, you will find someone saying they can't vacate the forest. The community will arrest them and we, as the KFS, shall charge them in court according to the law," he said. Kirisia Community Forest Association chairperson Doglous Leboiyare said communities that live within forests have been given space along the boundaries. "As a community forest association, we've sensitised wananchi and they have agreed to leave the forest. They say they don’t want to be forced out of the forest as was witnessed [in other areas],” Leboiyare said. Tyson Loldepe said, "Nobody is forcing us out of the forest. We're leaving voluntarily because of the community. They have made us understand the importance of this forest."
