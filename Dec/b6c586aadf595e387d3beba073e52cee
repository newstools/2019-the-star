Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga on Monday lauded the National Government and the World Bank for their contribution in the desilting of Miruka (Bondo) and Adhiri (Rarieda) dams. The projects, whose cumulative cost is Sh17.2 million, were co-funded by County Government of Siaya and are set to boost food production, water supply and aquaculture farming in the county. Speaking while inspecting the two projects, Rasanga said he was  happy with the progress, particularly because the public was engaged in the development. “We have lobbied funds for these projects to ensure sustainable agriculture through irrigation. As we encourage our farmers to embrace diversification, we hope to realise high-value crops and vegetable at the household level to boost food security,” said Rasanga. According to the county department of Agriculture, the administration is looking forward to wooing farmers to more onside horticulture and aquaculture given that the areas surrounding the dams constitute fertile lands fit for agriculture. The Adhiri and Miruka dam projects are being implemented by Climate-Smart Agriculture Programme with an end goal plan to install solar pumps that will assist in upstream water uptake. Speaking at the same function, Agriculture Executive Elizabeth Odhiambo rallied support for the governor's approach of investing in dams. She said this is a guarantee to transforming the livelihoods of Siaya residents. “Water is a great resource whose use should be maximised. We will also be introducing fingerlings in the dams for residents to reap the benefits fully," added Odhiambo.
