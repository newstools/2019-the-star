The appointment of ballot rejects to state corporations aggravates youth unemployment, young people in Meru have said. They criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta for bypassing qualified youth and appointing election losers and retirees to parastatal and government jobs. The youth expressed themselves during a talent search at Kauthene in Nyaki West ward, North Imenti constituency. Performances included spoken word, comedy, rap, journalism exploits, poems and songs. The contestants criticised the Jubilee government for not fulfilling its 2013 and 2017 promises to empower the youth and create jobs for them. Doreen Mwendwa recited a poem composed by her elder brother Kayfar Mureti. The piece was about corruption scandals dogging politicians entrusted with safeguarding public coffers. “The year of politics comes, like madman in the city, they shout at the top of their voices, lika a newly married couple, they make promises even to the youngest member, driving in Land Rovers, so us to reach the remotest part of the country, the D-day arrives, like sheep to slaughterhouse, citizens move in masses to vote them…two years down the line, the country remains the same, looting they start, making us poor, in Ranges they drive, since Land Rovers are not their class,” Mwendwa recited. “They get ministers as political rewards, political menopause they reach, but still glued in government seats, same happens to their children.” My Voice Communications director Caroline Kathambi, who organised the Talanta Mashinani search, said drug and alcohol abuse are a great setback to the youth. Kathambi said the search will proceed to the other five wards in the constituency and urged area leaders, none of whom turned up despite invitations, to pitch in and help talented youth.
