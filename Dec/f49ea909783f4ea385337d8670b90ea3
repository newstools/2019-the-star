Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology assistant coach John Asila insists they are ready to give Strathmore Leos a run for their money when the two unbeaten sides collide in a KRU Championship highlight encounter of the weekend in Kakamega. “Strathmore has been in Kenya Cup for the last 10 years so they are an experienced team. However, it will be a tight, competitive game. Our target is to win the game,” said Asila. “So far the league has been very competitive. You can't write off any team.” Leos' newly-appointed coach Louis Kisia also vowed to win his first game in charge. “MMUST is a good team but we are heading there for maximum points. It will be a closely contested match. We want to maintain our winning ways,” said the former Mwamba RFC assistant coach. “My target is a quick return to Kenya Cup but first I want us to finish in top two positions so that we get a home semi-final fixture. In two years, I'm aiming at winning Kenya Cup honours.” Last weekend, MMUST narrowly defeated former Kenya Cup winners Mean Machine 18-16 in a tight game while Leos walloped USIU 38-3 to consolidate their lead. Struggling and bottom of the table Kisii RFC will welcome Mean Machine at Gusii Stadium. Kisii has dished out two walkovers and are staring at relegation in case they miss a third. USIU Martials will be up against impressive Northern Suburbs in Roysambu while Egerton Wasps host Mombasa RFC at Egerton University in Njoro, Nakuru County. The University of Eldoret host a doubleheader. In the early kick-off, Eldoret face South Coast Pirates with Eldoret coach David Wachie hoping for a win. “We decided that we must win all our home games come rain or sunshine,” a bullish Wachie said. In the second game, University of Eldoret's Trojans will take on the Catholic Monks. Trojans have had a poor run of four consecutive losses and coach Kelvin Otieno will go for a win against Monks.
