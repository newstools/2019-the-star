Three senior employees of Oilibya ordered the breaking into a service station on Juja Road and stole property worth Sh1.5 million, a witness said yesterday. Ben Mbako, a KK security guard, said Joyce Nekoye Wanjala (territory manager), Nancy Waeni Mutune (retail manager) and Antony Mugo Muraya (network manager) gave the order. “I was the security guard at the station…I confirm that these employees asked for the breaking of the OiLibya office door along Juja Road,”Mbako said. In June, four senior employees of Libya Oil Kenya Limited including Stanley Njoroge Marete (a contractor) were charged with breaking into a building at Juja Road service station and stealing property worth Sh1, 530,000 on June 7, 2017. They were accused of stealing 10 units of CCTV system cameras worth Sh400,000, digital video recorders valued at Sh200,000, gas cylinders worth Sh200,000, lubricants valued at Sh500,000, car wash vacuum cleaners worth Sh30,000 and fuel estimated to be worth Sh200,000 — property of Maced Limited. The four appeared before principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot and pleaded not guilty. The court directed them to deposit a cash bail of Sh100, 000 each. The criminal case was reopened in June, a year after a magistrate court had closed the file. High Court judge Chacha Mwita declined to stop the fresh prosecution of the four as recommended by the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Justice Mwita observed that while the criminal case had been terminated lawfully, the DPP was not barred from preferring the same charges against the accused.
