There are no regulatory frameworks around assisted reproduction and that affects not just those seeking services but also the providers of those services. One, for those who are Kenyan nationals it is not clear how you, for example, register births for assisted reproduction. If you are foreigners, how do you leave the country with a child born through surrogacy for instance? Like any healthcare service, some assisted reproductive services are expensive and, therefore, out of reach for many people who need them. The regulation should also deal with the question of cost. For example, whether that service can be part of what is covered by the NHIF. One of the things that have to be addressed in the regulations is the question of access and affordability so some services can be availed to people who cannot afford it. But even for those who can afford it, it is very expensive and financially eroding in efforts to have a child. Countries that regulate assisted reproduction have provided varying ways or rights for all the parties involved, including surrogates. There are countries where surrogates are entitled to limited engagement with the child and the family and in some, upon birth, contact between the surrogate, the child and the parents ends. Kenya should address these concerns and our unique position on the rights of surrogate mothers. Surrogacy is a service; upon the birth of the child, the parents have the greatest gift. Rules should, therefore, be made to prevent the surrogate from going to court to blackmail them or to insist on having greater rights to the child than the parents. In South Africa, there is no commercial surrogacy. For example, the law allows compensation or payment for relevant services, for example, treatment or food. Surrogates may only claim pregnancy related expenses. Just like any other service, women involved should be given reasonable support to enable them to support families to get children.
