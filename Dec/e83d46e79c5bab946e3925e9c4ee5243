Fish farmers from South Imenti subcounty have lamented extortion by traders of feeds and a lack of market for meagre returns from their produce. They have also blamed Ameru culture and beliefs on poor fish-eating habits which hamper sales. The farmers have urged Governor Kiraitu Murungi’s administration to help them secure markets for fish or directly buy from farmers. Nominated MCA Gacheri Muthuri who spoke on behalf of the group said most of the fish farmers are not engaged in any meaningful employment. Gacheri said that a lot of farmers in Meru were willing to venture into fish farming but are discouraged by lack of market. “We want to reach out to the county government to support us get to other markets and sensitise Meru people on fish-eating habits,” he said. Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi praised the group's efforts and committed to supporting their initiative. Kiraitu spoke in Nkubu on Friday during the Neema Bridge Builders fish-eating dinner. The governor, Jesus House of Praise Bishop Kiogora Magambo and Eldoret Based Bishop Mike Bitok were guest speakers. Kiraitu said that Meru has received a grant of Sh1 billion for fish farmers, which will be used to develop the sub-sector for eight years. He challenged Meru women to entrench fish-eating culture by cooking it in their homes. “Women have control over food and I am calling on Meru women to cook fish in their homes and their husbands will have no choice but to eat it,” Kiraitu said.
