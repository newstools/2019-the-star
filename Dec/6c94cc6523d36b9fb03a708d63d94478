Asked what the secret behind her good run is in the 72 hole event, Engström quipped, "Striking the ball very well and keeping it in the fairways." She added: "Today was that good as I was unwell and made some mistakes on my ball striking. I managed to make some birdies which is good. I hit the waters in the eighth which wasn't that good. But all in all I have been hitting the ball well and really relied on my ball striking this week. I just hit a bad shot in the eighth and got into the waters but good quite tired towards the end as I was not feeling well."
