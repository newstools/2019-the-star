Births registration officers in Kwale have been warned of stern action after the office was termed the most corrupt. Some of the senior officers were accused of soliciting huge amounts of money from citizens applying for birth certificates. County commissioner Karuku Ngumo on Jamhuri Day confirmed the allegations saying he had received complaints. “I have got various phone calls from people crying that registration officers are demanding facilitation fees,” he said. Ngumo condemned the act and said necessary measures have been put in place to scrutinise the office and arrest the culprits. He said getting birth certificates is free except for the late registration in which case the office normally charges Sh150 as a fine. “Get me properly: application for newborns is exempted from any charges unless you have delayed, that is when some little fees must be applied,” he said. Ngumo called upon MCAs to join him and help identify corrupted individuals. He said they would be of aid "since some residents fear government offices". The administrator decried that birth certificates were piling up in offices as owners were not picking them up. “The birth certificates are now lying in dust. Please come for them if you applied before because they are ready." He commended some leaders for submitting the challenge to Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i when he toured the region.
