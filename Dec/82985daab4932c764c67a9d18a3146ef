The absence of midfielder Roy Okal, who has been drafted in Harambee Stars preliminary squad for the Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup, is a course for concern for Mathare United. Okal, will miss their next match after he was sent off for two bookable offences against Kakamega Homeboyz last Friday and coach Salim Ali has rued the dismissal as it will deprive the Slum Boys of one of their crucial players. “We will definitely miss Okal. He is a key component of this team but we have depth in that position and I know we will be fine,” said Ali. “To be sent off is part of the game and there is nothing we can do about it. On the flip side, it will give him the much-needed rest as he is one of the few players in this team to have been present in each and every game so far,” he added on the clubs official portal. A second loss in three matches has now curtailed Mathare's rise up the Kenyan Premier League ladder, further heightening Ali's worries. According to the coach, the loss to Kakamega Homeboyz on Friday in Machakos was down to a lack of concentration among the players. The disappointing 3-1 loss came after Mathare had lost their unbeaten start to the campaign at the hands of Sofapaka. That sequence of results that was interrupted by a big win away at Chemelil has left Mathare with 17 points, down in 10th place, eight points adrift of league leaders Gor Mahia. “It was a bad day in the office where nothing really went our way,” Salim said after the game. We struggled throughout the game which was all down to a lack of concentration across the field,” said Ali on Mathare's official portal. “Homeboyz are a good side and we played into their hands with our naivety. Also, our key players, whom we normally rely upon, failed to turn-up and against a team like Homeboyz you will be made to pay for any slackness.” Mathare's next outing is a tough trip to Nakuru to take on AFC Leopards on Sunday.
