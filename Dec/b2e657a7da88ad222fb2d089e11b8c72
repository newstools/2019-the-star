Six vehicles and a motorcycle were on Wednesday evening swept by floodwaters in Kayole, along Kangundo road in Nairobi. Kayole police boss Wilson Kosgei said the vehicles included two buses, one mini-bus, two saloon cars, one pick-up and a motorcycle belonging to a bodaboda rider. “The incident resulted from flooding of the road, people spent their nights on the highway following our security advisory,” Kosgei said. The police boss who spoke to the Star on Thursday said that the police officers also spent their night on the road at the most affected Chokaa area in an operation that started at around 8.00 pm to 5.00 am. “We stopped vehicles from moving on the road due to poor drainage and risky waterways, this led to heavy traffic snarl-up,” Kosgei said. Kosgei, however, divulged that there were no casualties as speculated by some netizens. He said all those who were in danger of drowning or being swept by the floods including the occupants of vehicles and motorcycle were rescued. “All motorists and passengers plying on the rout waited until the waters subsided on the road,” the police boss said. Kosgei said that the bridge connecting Nairobi to Machakos County at Matungulu subcounty's Kamulu area was equally in a bad state by Monday morning. He said River Athi had broken its banks thereby locking residents in their houses. “We have rescued a disabled woman and waiting for a chopper to evacuate other residents, this is a disaster,” Kosgei said. One of the motorists said he spent on the road at Chokaa area after the bypass became impassable. “I couldn’t move, I was locked by the floods along Kangundo road at Chokaa at 8.00 pm. I was from Ruai to my house in Utawala. I spent on the road until 5.00 am,” said Nelson Owino.
