It was pomp and glamour as the Coast Woman Magazine awarded heroines in a gala dinner at the Travellers Beach Hotel. Some 23 women from the six coastal counties and from different cadres of life—from corporate level to grassroots—were feted. Faiza Bajaber, the publisher of Coast Woman magazine, commended the recipients and encouraged them to do more for the community in terms of charity, education, healthcare, sports and various forms of empowerment. The ceremony was graced by Lamu Woman MP Ruweida Obo,  Citizen TV news anchor Lulu Hassan and Maliha Mohammed, the Mombasa-based chef who recently won the Guinness World Record cooking competition. The Coast Woman Magazine is a bi-monthly highlighting the activities of coastal woman excelling in work and impacting the society positively.
