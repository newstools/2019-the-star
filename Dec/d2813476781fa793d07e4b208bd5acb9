 The government has announced an amnesty offer for the 25 youths from Kwale who have been radicalised to willingly surrender to police. Msambweni deputy county commissioner Erick Wamlevu on Saturday said the youths will be given capital and equipment to start business enterprises. “We will offer a certain amount of money and different types of machinery to assist them to establish normal lives and cater for their families,” Wamlevu said. The government is targeting radicalised youths mainly from Ukunda, Diani, Bongwe-Gombato, Kinondo and Muhaka areas. Wamlevu said those afraid of police should approach religious leaders and people they trust to help them surrender. He said those willing to surrender will be given security. The administrator asked residents to seek assistance and government intervention whenever they feel depressed rather than engaging in illegal activities. “If anyone has been offended, especially a youth, before thinking of joining any gangs please the government offices are there and you will definitely be listened to,” he said. He said people should remain vigilant and report any criminal activities to boost security. Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori warned residents against hiding criminals. He told them to enforce the Nyumba Kumi policy and report to chiefs about their visitors. “From now on, any new face must be reported to the authorities and let their whereabouts be known because we don’t want to keep people with bad intentions,” Dori said.  edited by peter obuya
