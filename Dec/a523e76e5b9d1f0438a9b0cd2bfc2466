Shujaa grew in confidence and Alvin Otieno scored Kenya second try which was not converted for a 10- 0 lead Samoa regrouped and from their first real attack of the match Joe Perez sliced open the Kenya defence to touch down with John Vaili kicking over the conversion for a 10-7 lead in favour of Kenya Daniel Taabu then scored gem of a try just before the break beating four Samoan defenders to score at the centre, Taabu kicked over his conversion for a a 17-7 lead at half time On resumption matters went from bad to worse for the pacific islanders with Losi Filippo and Phillip Luki sent to the sinbin for cynical play. Kenya took advantage with Billy “the Kid” Odhiambo scoring the fourth try with Taabu adding the conversion for a 24-7 lead. The Samoans fought back with two late tries by Belgium Tuatagaloa and Perez but Shujaa held on for victory.
