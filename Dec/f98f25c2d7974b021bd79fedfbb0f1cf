The Alcohol Beverages Association of Kenya (ABAK) has urged retailers not to take advantage of Christmas festivities to overcharge revelers. He lobby group warned unscrupulous retailers out to make extra cash that selling alcohol beyond the Recommended Retail Prices (RRP is counterproductive because it drives consumers to cheaper, harmful alternatives which Is unsustainable for their businesses. The association's chairman Gordon Mutugi lamented that, despite well-spelt out prices, that are often published in the media for all to see and adhere to, it is not uncommon to see some retailers hiking prices beyond the recommended ranges. “This exaggerated pricing does not only make it difficult for our consumers to enjoy their favourite tipple, some find it difficult to access and result to cheap and often illicit brands,'' Mutugi said. He added that there are instances where retailers were adding prices per pack to gain more profit even in instances where manufacturers haven’t increased prices. He said this tactic may push consumers to illicit drinks. The lobby also cautioned road users against drinking and driving this season. '' Consumers are strongly advised to consider the use of taxis or designated drivers whenever they indulge. Our challenge to drivers is try to remain sober on the roads and drive safe,” Mutugi said.
