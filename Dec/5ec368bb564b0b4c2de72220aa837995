Suna East MP Junet Mohamed was on Saturday rushed to hospital over suspected food poisoning. The legislator complained of stomach pains after spending the whole day distributing bursaries and touring development projects in several wards in his constituency. He was rushed to St. Joseph Mission Hospital where he was treated and discharged. “I had a little bit of complication with my stomach. I am now safely at my house after a check-up with doctors,” Junet said in a social media post. On Sunday, his personal assistant Ochieng Ogejo said the legislator has just arrived in Migori town from the day’s activity when he started complaining of stomach pain. “He was not poisoned in any way, but he had normal stomach complications. He is out of danger and we will continue with development tours,” Ogejo said.
