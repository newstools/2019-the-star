Cases of insecurity in Keumbu, Nyaribari Chache constituency, reduced during the festivies after MP Richard Tong’i intervened. Tong’i held a meeting with county commissioner Stephen Kihara following complaints by residents. Speaking to the Star in Kisii town, the MP said criminals have been terrorising residents. He singled out an incident last month when criminals waylaid a woman who was operating and an M-Pesa shop in the area, tortured her before they brutally killed her and dumped her body by the roadside. “We cannot allow situations where some individuals with bad intentions terrorise people. I call upon our security agents to be vigilant and arrest these criminals,” Tong’i said. Kihara said police will conduct daily patrols in the entire county to improve security. “We have deployed police in every corner of the county to protect people’s lives as they continue with their celebrations during this festive season,” Kihara said. He warned those who engage in criminal activities in the region that their days are numbered. Kihara said they are closely monitoring some characters whom residents have been mentioning. The commissioner urged residents to report any suspicious characters. He also advised parents to closely monitor the movement of their children to keep them away from crime, drugs and substance abuse.
