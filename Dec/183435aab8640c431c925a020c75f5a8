Mbeere North MP Muriuki Njagagua has raised concern that many boda boda riders are increasingly dying while others are being injured in road accidents. Njagagua said most of these accidents happen because the riders are not trained in driving schools. He said they unknowingly break traffic rules, easily causing numerous  accidents in Embu county. Njagagua said his constituency has not been spared and such accidents happen almost daily. “You know there have been so many fatal and maiming road accidents involving boda boda taxis and today if you go to the level four and five hospitals’ mortuaries and wards you can’t miss bodies of persons who died in accidents involving the motorcycles or are admitted in wards with serious injuries,” said Njagagua. He called for efforts to prevent such accidents saying Embu county has been losing numerous resourceful persons in such accidents. Njagagua said well-wishers should intervene and help fund training of the riders because many engage in the out of poverty. He was speaking on Saturday at the Mbeere North National Government Constituency Development Fund Hall when he handed over driving course certificates to 150 boda boda taxi drivers, who trained at Pema Driving School. Njagagua said he funds the training to support the implementation President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four Agenda on health by helping in the prevention of accidents. Some of the beneficiaries included Ferista Muthoni and Salesio Swaleh. They said they will now drive in confidence and will not cause many accidents. Muthoni said she was sure many boda boda taxi accidents’ deaths and injuries  in Mbeere North constituency’s roads will be drastically reduced. “Any time we are on the road we usually fear coming across traffic officers for lack of driving licences but now with after getting them we shall be driving in confidence knowing too well we have documents to protect us from arrest,” said Swaleh.
