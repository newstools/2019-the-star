Singer Nyota Ndogo says she wouldn't stay in a marriage that she is not happy in for the sake of money. "I can never stay in an unhappy marriage," she wrote on Instagram. "I can't stay there to show people I'm okay yet I'm not. I can't stay in a troubled marriage. If I leave, I'll get married again and again. Don't be a sad person at the end of the day." In 2016, the 'Watu Na Viatu' hitmaker and mother of two walked down the aisle with her Dannish lover Henning Nielsen. "I'd like God to keep my marriage safe for years cause I love this man," she added.
