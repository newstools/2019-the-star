Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata has blamed the country's Judiciary for the late Charles Rubia's woes claiming that they had failed him at his hour of need. Speaking on Monday during the funeral service of Rubia in Kandara Constituency, Kang'ata who was also the late cabinet minister's lawyer, revealed that the case which he filed in 2012 is still pending in court. Rubia has been seeking compensation for torture during the agitation for multiparty politics under former President Daniel Moi's tenure. Kang'ata said even after filing the case for Rubia and attending court faithfully, the former cabinet minister died without getting the justice he deserved. "We need reforms in the Judiciary. How can Rubia file a case back then in 2012 and now eight years later that case is still pending in Court? Is that fair?" he said. "If at all they can do that to Rubia, failing to have his case heard in a matter of urgency what about the so many millions of Kenyans?" Kang'ata further offered to help President Uhuru Kenyatta transform the judiciary. "I will support your effort to clean up Judiciary to ensure Kenyans get justice in court," he said. Rubia died in his Karen home on Monday, December 23 and has been eulogised by many political dignitaries. Among those in attendance at the funeral service were the President, Murang'a Governor Mwangi Wa Iria, Woman Representative Sabina Chege, Cabinet Secretaries Eugene Wamalwa (Devolution), James Macharia (Transport), Monica Juma (Foreign Affairs). Others are Senators James Orengo (Siaya), Irungu Kang’ata (Murang’a), MPs Alice Wahome (Kandara), Millie Odhiambo (Suba North), Kembi Gitura (former Murang’a Senator), Peter Kenneth (former Gatanga MP) and Beatrice Elachi (Nairobi County Assembly Speaker).
