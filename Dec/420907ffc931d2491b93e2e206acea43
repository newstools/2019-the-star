The Nyeri government has called on all residents to be on high alert during the festive season because of a possible cholera outbreak. Health Services director Nelson Muriu said in a statement that the alert was issued following three confirmed cases of cholera in the neighbouring Kirinyaga county. “Due to the close proximity and frequent interaction between Nyeri county and the affected county, there is an increased danger of cross-border transmission,” he said. The letter dated 24 December also called on members of the public to ensure they treat or boil drinking water, wash their hands properly with clean water and soap after visiting a latrine and before handling or eating food. Residents were also advised to observe proper disposal of all human faeces, safe handling of foods during preparation and storage, keeping cooked food covers to avoid contamination by flies, avoiding hawked cooked food and avoid eating in unlicensed outlets. “Any suspected cases must be reported to the office of the county director of health for further investigation and for an immediate response,” it stated. The county government of Kirinyaga announced that an outbreak of the disease had been reported in Mwea. Kirinyaga county director of health George Karoki said the cases were reported last week.
