The prime suspect in the Star journalist Eric Oloo's murder case has been detained for 14 days to allow for further investigations. Chief Inspector Sabina Kerubo was arraigned on Monday before Principal Magistrate James Ongondo of the Siaya law courts. The prosecutor Tracey Nambisia requested for 14 days for more investigations which were granted by the court. Kerubo will be locked up at the Siaya DCIO's office pending investigations. Nambisia said the suspect is a senior officer and is likely to interfere with the case hence more time to interrogate her junior officers is needed while she is in custody. According to the affidavit sworn by the Investigating Officer Joseph Kinuthia, he is conducting investigations into the murder offence which Kerubo and other suspects in custody have been accused of. Already two suspects were arraigned in court on November 21, 2019. The two brothers have been accused of killing Oloo. Oloo was laid to rest today at his Ugunja home last Saturday. The postmortem report showed that Oloo died from trauma caused by injury to his head and abdomen. Government pathologist Gabriel Juma on Sunday said Oloo died as a result of excessive bleeding. "The body had a blunt injury on the head and a severe hemorrhage intra-abdominally as a result of the blunt injury on the abdomen," Juma said.
