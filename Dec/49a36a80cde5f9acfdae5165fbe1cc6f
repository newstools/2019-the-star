The Machakos assembly has passed a motion to have the county government equip all public health facilities with anti-venom drugs. The move follows complaints by residents of Mwala subcounty that many were dying from snakebites. Wamunyu ward rep Thomas Musyoka proposed the motion during a Bunge Mashinani sitting in Kibauni ward. Musyoka said health facilities in the area have no anti-venom drugs hence people have either been paralysed or died unattended after snakebites. He said victims of snakebites travel for more than four hours to Mwala Level 4 hospital to get treated. “Snake and scorpion bites have often been reported here but there are no drugs in our hospitals,” he said. Musyoka told residents to promptly report the presence of deadly snakes to the Kenya Wildlife Services. Kibauni MCA Annastacia Nduku said cases of snakebites are increasing, especially during this festive season. Nduku urged Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua to ensure that all dispensaries and health facilities are equipped with the drugs to save lives. The motion was passed unopposed by more than 30 MCAs who attended the seating. Health CEC Ancent Kituku told the Star that 394 cases of snakebites have been reported in the last one year. Masinga has the most cases with 101 incidents reported.  Yatta subcounty had 68 while Kangundo recorded 48 cases. Eleven cases were reported in Kalama while Kathiani had 20. Kituku said he has directed polyvalent snake anti-venom be stocked in all Level 4 hospitals in the county. The antivenin is available in Mwala and Matuu Level 4 hospitals but the quantity needs to be increased to arrest rising cases, he said. "Polyvalent snake antivenom is available at Machakos Level 5, Kangundo Level 4, Matuu Level 4, and Kathiani Level 4," he said.
