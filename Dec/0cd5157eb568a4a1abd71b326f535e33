Examination results for 1,309 candidates were cancelled over their involvement in cheating this year. The number is three times lower than the 4,519 candidates whose results were cancelled for cheating last year. A breakdown from the Ministry of Education shows collusion among candidates led to the cancellation of 1,158 results this year, compared to 4,355 last year. Further, results of 101 candidates were cancelled because they sneaked in unauthorised materials into the exam room, compared to 142  in 2018. Another 47 were caught with mobile phones this year, compared to 20 in the 2018 KCSE. Results of two candidates were cancelled over impersonation, compared to one last year. The results of one candidate were cancelled this year, as well as last year, because they caused a disturbance. Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha named Kisii and Nairobi's Eastleigh area as the cheating hot spots. Other affected areas were Wajir, Garissa, Migori and Homa Bay. "In Kisii, we apprehended more than 10 impersonators who had connived with unscrupulous people to produce fake photo albums to give the impression they were genuinely KNEC registered candidates," he said yesterday. Magoha added: "In Nairobi’s Eastleigh, we collected 35 mobile phones from a single centre. There were some cases of individuals who were attempting early exposure of examination papers, among others ills." He said this year, the Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) withheld results for 658 candidates just for routine checks on small details, including accuracy of their names and registration details. "These results will be released to candidates as soon as the verification process is completed," Magoha said. He claimed there was no examination leakage detected this year. A total of 669,745 candidates sat the 2019 KCSE that began on November 4. Last year, the candidates who cheated were allowed to resit the examination this year. However, the Teachers Service Commission sacked 14 teachers accused of exam malpractice. Last year, then Education CS Amina Mohammed said some candidates were so desperate that they inserted money in the examination booklets they submitted for marking. Some candidates left up to Sh1,000 in the answer booklets. In the 2017 KCSE, Knec annulled the results of 1,205 candidates. No results were cancelled in the 2016 KCSE, with then Education CS Fred Matiang'i claiming the glory for allegedly curbing cheating. In 2015 KCSE, results of 5,101 students from 305 Secondary Schools were cancelled. In 2015, the leading cheats were in Nairobi, Meru and Makueni. In 2014, the Education Ministry cancelled the results of 2,975 candidates from all counties, except Isiolo.
