The Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji has issued a warning to Samburu Governor Moses Lenolkulal and his Kiambu counterpart Ferdinand Waititu. Haji said the two governors who were released on bail will be arrested if they disobey court orders by opening parallel offices in their respective counties. Senate Deputy Speaker Kithure Kindiki ruled on Wednesday that the two can deliver on their roles without stepping into their offices. After the senate's decision, Waititu threatened to open a parallel office by Friday and hold a cabinet meeting. While issuing Sonko's arrest orders on Friday, Haji warned the Senate from interfering with court orders adding that his office will not allow such acts. "The senate's action to disregard court orders and urge Waititu to open a parallel office well aware that the High Court has pronounced itself on this question is worrying," Haji said. Kaimbu deputy governor James Nyoro has been in charge of Kiambu county affairs and had earlier said that he will step aside for Waititu once the court clears him from graft charges. Governor Lenolkulal is also facing four counts of abuse of office and conflict of interest leading to the loss of Sh84.6 million public funds. He is accused of using his company-Oryx Service Station-to supply petrol and diesel to the county.
