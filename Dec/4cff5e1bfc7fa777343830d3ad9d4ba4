Sixteen landslide victims have not been found and West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo has called on the government to provide sniffer dogs. Speaking on Wednesday after receiving donations, Lonyangapuo said the dogs will detect buried bodies and hasten the recovery mission. The landslide occurred two weeks ago. The official death toll from several villages is 52. “We have used all means within our reach to find those still missing but we have not been able to recover their bodies. Residents have been digging in the mud using jembes without success," he said. Lonyangapuo said the government has been slow to respond to the disaster and asked ministries to shift their focus to the county. Major bridges have been cut off and transport is crippled, he said. “The army should help set up temporary bridges but now it’s two weeks and they have not helped," the governor said. Two bridges along Marich Tamkal road had been washed away and residents were not able to move. “Pokot Central subcounty has been cut off for two weeks. Residents cannot access clean water since roads are impassable," Lonyangapuo said. Victims of the landslide have also condemned the government for its slow response, saying they are bitter they will not be able to accord their beloved ones a decedent send-off. “Many people have not found their loved ones and the government is not helping us in finding the bodies,” William Lokapel said. Lokapel said that the government directed a lot of effort in the Solai Dam and Mombasa ferry tragedies and asked why they have been ignored. On Tuesday 15 patients were discharged from Kapenguria County Hospital. A memorial service will be held on Tuesday next week. (Edited by V. Graham)
