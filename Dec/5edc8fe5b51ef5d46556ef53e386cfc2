Two boys who went sailing on a canoe in Masinga dam drowned after it capsized due to strong wind. Nicholas Matembei and David Muriuki, both 10 years old, drowned in the hydro-electricity mega dam in Embu County on Saturday after they reportedly went to entertain themselves by travelling in one of the canoes used by the locals for fishing across the dam. Riakanau Location chief Kimeu Musyimi said one of the boys was from Kagio area of Kirinyaga County. He had visited his grandmother when he met the other boy and both decide to have fun at the dam. Musyimi said he was informed by witnesses that a fierce wind swept across the dam and overwhelmed upon the boys and the canoe before it capsized. He said the boys reportedly tried to swim to the banks but were unable and they drowned. Musyimi said locals tried to use other canoes to rescue them in vain. They also tried to retrieve their bodies but gave up. He said they resumed the search on Sunday when they recovered the bodies and took them to Mwea Mission Hospital Mortuary. “It was unfortunate that the two boys drowned and thus I urge parents and guardians to keep an eye on the movements of their children owing to the many risks out there that they put themselves in especially in places with rivers and dams,” said Musyimi.
