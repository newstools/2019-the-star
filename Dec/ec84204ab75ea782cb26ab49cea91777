Nairobi county assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi has ordered formation of an ad hoc committee to investigateÂ  alleged mismanagement of the Nairobi County Public Service Board. A petition on the matter by two residents, Jackson Oduor and Benson Waweru, was presented to the Speaker by nominated MCA Millicent Okatch. To be investigated are claims that various decisions of the board are not implemented. The petitioners question how the board handled the nurses strike and recruitment of staff for the county. Elachi directed majority and minority whips June Ndegwa Peter Imwatok to form a nine-member ad-hoc committee to look into the petition. "The accusations are weighty and I saw it was best, and with the direction of the County Assembly Standing Order 2015, that an ad hoc committee be formed to look into the matter. Such a petition cannot be taken lightly as it comes from residents of Nairobi who have raised reasonable queries," Elachi told the Star yesterday. "The timing is however a bit off because the assembly is breaking for long recess next week until February but I shall ensure that the matter is looked into." The Speaker said the chairperson of the Labour committee will be part of the ad-hoc since the matter touches on labour and welfare issues. The committee shall look into measures, if any, being put in place to fast track pending recruitment , re-designations and promotions and timelines for the same. The County Public Service board consists of Abdihakim Mohamed (chairperson), Consolata Muthoni, Thomas Mweu, Sharon Mirella and Aisha Wanjiku. The board has only been in office for five months. It was vetted and approved by the assembly in June and gazetted in July. Some of the functions of the board include establishing or abolishing offices in the county public service and appointing persons to hold or act in offices of the county public service.
