Disarmament will be carried out in East African countries once the amnesty period expires, Rift Valley regional commissioner George Natembeya has said. The countries are Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and South Sudan. Natembeya said they are in talks with neighbouring countries to conduct forced disarmament as soon as the amnesty given to surrender illegal firearms expires. "A few weeks ago, we had a meeting in Mombasa with commissioners from Uganda and agreed to carry out forced disarmament. Ethiopia and South Sudan are also planning for forced disarmament to confiscate illegal firearms in an effort to stamp out cattle rustling," he said. Natembeya spoke during a three-day visit to insecurity hotspots of Loima subcounty, Kibish in Turkana North and Kapedo in Turkana South. He said members of the East African Community have discovered that illegal firearms in the hands of civilians hurt development. Natembeya said 203 illegal firearms have been collected in Turkana during the amnesty, and they are still expecting more to be surrendered. "We gave amnesty to residents to surrender any illegal guns to the government and so far we have only recovered 203 firearms which is below our target," the administrator said. He said amnesty would not last long and if forced disarmament starts, those found with illegal firearms would be arrested and taken to court to face the law.
