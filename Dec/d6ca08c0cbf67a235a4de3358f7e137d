Surprisingly, in this year’s KCSE exam results, most top candidates in the region came from public school, challenging the dominance of private schools candidates. Public schools in the region have witnessed a mass exodus of teachers due to terrorism, lack of infrastructure, limited reading materials, unfriendly environment amongst other challenges. Abdiqani Abdi from Garissa’s County High School also scored an A-, while Issack Alio Issack from Mandera Secondary School got an A- topping the border county.
