Despite finishing last in the first round of Kenya Cup matches, Kisumu RFC coach Brian Makalama is confident of helping the team avoid relegation. “We are positive about keeping our Kenya Cup status. That was our target when the season started,” Makalama told the Star in an interview. The Kenyan-born Ugandan said they are in the process of bolstering the team ahead of the second leg. “Recruitment of new players is ongoing and we expect the new players to join us in training on January 2, 2020. The main challenge has been quality depth and playing unit consistency in both playing and training,” said Makalama. He said they are targeting at least five players including a hooker, flyhalf and fullbacks. Despite winning just one match in the opening round, Makalama said his players gave a good account of themselves. “First round had its ups and downs. Both the coaching and playing units learned a lot from each other. The experience we gained will come in handy in the second round. This is the first time for the boys are playing in the Kenya Cup league,” he added. The club sit bottom of the 12-team table with five points, having shipped in a whopping 435 points. Kenyatta University’s Blak Blad are 11th with eight points. Kabras Sugar closed the year on top of the standings with 40 points, a point and place better of defending champions Kenya Commercial Bank.
