  Wolves are on their best unbeaten run in the top flight since 1972 after seeing off West Ham with strikes from Leander Dendoncker and Patrick Cutrone at Molineux. Nuno Espirito Santo’s side are back up to fifth in the Premier League after the Hammers failed to reproduce the kind of display that helped them to a shock win against Chelsea. It has been quite a turnaround for the Midlands side, who failed to record a win in their first six games but have now not lost any of their past 10, a run that began after their 5-2 home defeat by Chelsea on September 14. Spanish winger Adama Traore has played a key role over this period and was excellent again on Wednesday, but the goals came from Dendoncker and substitute Cutrone. The Belgian defender gave Wolves the lead when he poked in from Joao Moutinho’s corner in the 23rd minute, before Cutrone found the corner with a low drive, two minutes after replacing Raul Jimenez. West Ham’s best chances fell the way of Pablo Fornals and Robert Snodgrass. Fornals forced a good save from Rui Patricio with a curling shot, before Snodgrass’ heavy touch allowed the Portuguese keeper to snuff out the danger. The Wolves supporters were singing Traore’s name within the first 20 minutes of the match. Praised by manager Nuno for his performance in the side’s 2-1 win against Bournemouth last month, he followed that with another excellent run-out against Sheffield United on Sunday. On Wednesday, the former Barcelona player gave Aaron Cresswell and Fornals a workout right from the first whistle. The 23-year-old has always been lauded for his great pace, but his crossing has improved noticeably this campaign. He provide two great balls from the right in the opening quarter, one of which needed a headed clearance from Fabian Balbuena to prevent Jimenez from nodding in.
