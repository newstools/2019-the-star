Arsenal have confirmed that defender Kieran Tierney faces around three months on the sidelines after suffering a dislocated right shoulder in last Monday’s Premier League win at West Ham United. “Kieran will undergo surgery next week and will rehabilitate for around three months,” the club’s website said on Saturday. The 22-year-old Scotland left back was substituted just before the half-hour mark in the 3-1 derby win at West Ham after falling badly and used his shirt as a makeshift sling as he left the pitch. Arsenal are also without Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka after he suffered concussion in the head at West Ham and defender Hector Bellerin with a tight hamstring.
