A Baringo based GSU officer is among three suspects arrested over the abduction of a 36 year old Safaricom employee in Mombasa. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations on Saturday said two men and a woman were nabbed while on the run from Malindi on Friday night. "Constable Kelvin Komora, alongside two civilians were last night arrested by DCI Detectives in Mombasa after abducting a 36 year old Safaricom employee who works in Malindi, in a suspected loan recovery mission," read a tweet by the DCI. According to the DCI, the female victim had allegedly taken a loan of Sh500,000 from one of her abductors identified as Grace Wairimu but failed to meet the agreed payment deadline. Wairimu allegedly sought the assistance of the police officer and another manÂ  by the name Omar Mwanguze to get her payment. "The three had ambushed and forced the victim into a private car before driving off from Malindi," DCI said. Upon receiving a tip of possible abduction, DCI Detectives made pursuit of the suspects' vehicle. Realizing they are cornered, the suspects drove into Central Police Station in Mombasa where the victim was rescued safely and the trio arrested. DCI has launched an investigation into the incident.
