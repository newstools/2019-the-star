Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria  has said the only solution to a peaceful country will be the retirement of ODM leader Raila Odinga from politics. "The only solution to ensure peace in this country is to have Raila going back home in Bondo. Izi zingine ni story(all these other things can't foster peace," Kuria said. He spoke during  a fundraising drive at Ndagaini Catholic church, Tharaka Nithi on Saturday afternoon. Kuria said he went through the BBI report but couldn't find solutions in the book  on how to counter violence during elections. "Nimesoma hiyo kitabu yote na sijaona mahali inazungumzia juu ya vita(The book doesn't give solutions on ending electoral violence)," he said. He called for swift deliberations on the BBI report by March 31.

Kenya will see the return of the position of Prime Minister if the Building Bridges Initiative Taskforce proposals are to be implemented in full. The report proposes that Kenyans continue to elect their President who remains the Head of State and Government. The report also says that the Deputy President should remain the principal assistant to the President and will be the running mate. The President will then appoint an MP from the largest party or coalition in Parliament as Prime Minister who will take up the position after being approved by Parliament. The report adds that the Prime Minister shall have supervision and execution of the day-to-day functions and affairs of the Government.
