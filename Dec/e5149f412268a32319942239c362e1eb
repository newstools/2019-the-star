A Nairobi court has dismissed an application filed by the Director of Public Prosecution seeking orders to trace and seize assets belonging to two companies associated with businessman Humphrey Kariuki. "The DPP and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations obtained an earlier order to trace the assets of Wow Beverages Limited and Africa Spirits Limited in breach of the law," magistrate Elector Riany ruled. The DPP had obtained the orders from Milimani Resident Magistrate Caroline Nzibe on August 9. Kariuki and the two companies filed an application seeking to reverse the court orders saying it erred in granting the seizing of properties of Wow Beverages Limited. Through his advocate Benjamin Musyoki, the businessman argued that the orders have the effect of shutting down, crippling and thwarting the business of Wow Beverages Limited. The businessman said that the orders were obtained in bad faith. He argues that the order is an attempt by the DPP to usurp powers vested in him and is an abuse of a court process, contrary to the Constitution.
