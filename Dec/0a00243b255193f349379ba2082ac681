@ManuelOdeny  Police have arrested a man and his two wives after rescuing his daughter who underwent FGM in Ntimaru, Kuria East constituency in Migori county. Kuria East police boss Benjamin Rotich said the minor was already circumcised when police officers were alerted of a family celebration. The Bwirege clan of the Kuria community is currently conducting circumcision with locals resisting attempts to arrest its officials. “We arrested the man and his two wives for allowing the girl to be circumcised in their homestead without alerting the police about illegal activity in their home,” Rotich said. He said the minor was rescued but that the suspects will help in arresting more accomplices. As of Tuesday, about 35 girls were said to have escaped female genital mutilation and were being housed at Tarang’anya Girls Boarding School under the sponsorship of Gosese, a non-government organisation. The NGO's chairperson Susan Mutinde said most of the girls have been hidden by their mothers at the center while others were afraid of disrupting their education with the imminent threat of forced early marriage after the circumcision. “We realised we don’t have a rescue center in Migori county and we needed to shelter the victims on meager budget,” Mutinde said.  edited by peter obuya
