Daystar University students have distributed free sanitary towels to inmates at the Langa'ta Women's Prison. The students led by Cepha Mwenda and Esther Wangari distributed the pads to the inmates during a visit on Thursday last week. They were accompanied by Girl Up Umoja, Girl Foundation Kenya, Smiley Foundation, Mc_Cepha Event Solutions, Autism Lights Through Hope Kid, Yellow York, AIESEC and Lee Trends.   "We were seated with two inmates when I asked one of them for how long she would be in prison and she told us she was sentenced for life. Everyone went silent because nobody knew what to say next," she said. "I am a parent and I feel very challenged by this group of young people who have come to visit us today. It shows a lot of humanity and humility. It gives us a lot of hope," an inmate said. Mwenda thanked the students for their contributions and authorities at the correctional facility for allowing the to visit the inmates.
