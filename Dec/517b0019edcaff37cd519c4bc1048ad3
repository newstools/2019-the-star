Wazalendo coach Fidelis Kimanzi thinks his charges will need to have cohesion if they are to deliver on international stage. In their match against visiting Exchequers of Ghana, who they drew 2-2,  the tactician said his players lacked teamwork and proper build-up.  The Kenyans allowed the Ghanaians back in the after a 2-0 lead at the break. The coach said he believes his side has what it takes to win matches but they need to be consistent in their style of play. " The Ghanaians played to a particular structure and maintained it throughout and that is how they snatched a pointed," he lamented. Wazalendo were the most entertaining team in the league this season with a huge junk of possession but have struggled to break down the opposition. He said their invaluable experience gained from their friendly match will come in handy next season. “The most important thing was not the result but the technical and tactical set up of our opponents," he noted. "Their identity was evident all through and I was impressed with how they managed the game. We need a winning mentality and a killer instinct inside the D in order to put teams to the sword," noted Kimanzi . Exchequers week-long exploits in the country came to an end yesterday after playing six matches with local teams and Kenya Select side.
