President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday congratulated UK's Prime minister Johnson Boris after win. Johnson's party, Conservatives, had a resounding victory win in the United Kingdom's General Election held on Thursday. By Friday morning in Britain, the Conservative Party had secured a majority of the 650 seats in the House of Commons. The result handed Johnson his first national election victory but also delivered a dramatic blow to his main competitor, opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose Labour Party suffered heavy losses. Uhuru underscored the strong bilateral and historical ties between Kenya and the United Kingdom. "...I assure the PM of my commitment to continue working closely with his Administration for the mutual benefit of the people of the two countries," Uhuru said in a tweet on Friday. In August 2018, the President left his delegates chuckling after he forgot Boris Johnson's second name. While addressing Kenyans during a live press conference, Uhuru forgot Boris's name calling him 'the Bicycle guy'. The President was answering a question from a journalist who asked him what he felt about British leaders not coming to Kenya for more than 30 years. â€œLast year if you recall the Foreign Secretary then, Boris...erm...Boris...Boris Johnson...the bicycle guy was here," Uhuru said amid laughter in the crowd.
