KRU Championship enters this year’s penultimate round with second-placed Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST) taking on fourth-placed debutants Northern Suburbs. “We are hopeful that we will bounce back from last weekend’s loss against Leos. In a game, you win some and lose some but we are heading to Nairobi with a positive mind,” said MMUST coach Ochieng Ahaya yesterday. Last weekend, MMUST lost their first game succumbing to 19-10 to Strathmore Leos in Kakamega. Suburbs coach Simon Jawichire said he expects  tough and physical duel against MMUST but remained confident that his boys will deliver. “It’s a critical game for us because cross over games are key to determining a team’s chances of playing in the playoff which is our target,” added Jawichire. Log leaders Strathmore Leos will welcome struggling and bottom of the table Kisii RFC at Madaraka, seeking to extend their lead on top of the log. Leos who were relegated last season from Kenya Cup,  lead the log with 33 points, —eight clear of second placed MMUST on 25 points.  Kisii coach Eric Bosire is aiming to win the game. “We are in a bad position at the moment and our two games before the break are very critical. Financial problems have seen us dish out two walkovers. Our main objective now is to remain in the league,” said Bosire. Third-placed Mean Machine also relegated from Kenya Cup last season will host seventh placed University of Eldoret’s Trojans at the University of Nairobi. United States International University faces a tricky encounter against South Coast Pirates at St Joseph’s School in Ukunda while Mombasa will be at home to Eldoret at the Mombasa Sports Club.
