The annual edition of Sir Charles Oppong Buchere football tournament enters the quarter-final stage today at Emulunya Primary School in Khwisero, Kakamega County. Wazee FC lock horns with Misango Red Stars in the first quarter and usher in a derby treat between Simba FC and Kisa All Stars in the second. Wanachopa FC meet Corinthians FC while defending champions Leeds FC battle it out with Olympia FC. Simba FC earned bragging rights against Wazee FC in a Boxing Day fixture, beating them 2-1 in an exciting Group 'C' match played at a fully-thronged Emulunya Primary Grounds. Although both teams had qualified for the quarter-finals, top spot was still at stake. A Eugene Muka’s cross-like shot in the 18th minute was misjudged by the Wazee FC goalkeeper and sailed to the corner of the net. Bernard Omoth capitalised on another defensive mishap between the goalkeeper and his defenders to tap the ball into an empty net in the 38th minute. Wazee FC managed a consolation in the 69th minute courtesy of a Richard Mwashi’s belter. The Buchere family from Emulunya village in Kakamega County has been organising the annual event since December 2013 in commemoration of the late Charles Derrick Buchere, a former footballer. A total of 16 teams took part in this year’s edition which will conclude on January 1, 2020.
