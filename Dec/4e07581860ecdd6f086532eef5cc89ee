Speaker Justin Muturi and Lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi on Tuesday exchanged words on Twitter over BBI. On Monday, the National Assembly Speaker said politicians will mutilate the Building Bridges Initiative proposals to suit their interests if it is brought to Parliament. Muturi explained that the report cannot be brought to Parliament in its current form. The speaker said that the process was initiated by the Executive and can only be brought to the House through a bill or a policy for adoption. But in a Twitter post, Ahmednasir said if Muturi was an average lawyer, he would take his reading of the Constitution 'very Seriously'. "...fortunately no one has ever taken the foolish risk of relying on his interpretation of the law..."  he said. But in a quick rejoinder, Muturi asked Ahmednasir to stop being personal in everything. "Stop being personal and be civil," Muturi said. Ahmednasir did not relent and instead continued to argue with the speaker openly. "I am civil Sir...it is fair to state Sir as I have done that your tenure as Speaker Sir is defined by a total subversion of the constitution..." he said. He continued "...that is your record Sir...that is your legacy Sir and Mr. Speaker Sir..you can never run away from that...Sir." Muturi told him to show which parts of the constitution he had subverted. The speaker said that not a single constitutional amendment has been passed in Parliament since 2013 and doubted if BBI will sail through. The report, launched last  Wednesday by President Uhuru Kenyatta, has made a proposal to change the country’ governance structure. In particular, the report recommends the introduction of a prime minister to be appointed by the President. Politicians are, however, divided on how the report should be implemented. Those allied to President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga want the report implemented through a referendum.
