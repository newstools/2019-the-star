Political leaders in Tana River, Isiolo and Marsabit counties have called for the revocation of Gazette notice 150 establishing Isiolo county as an adjudication zone. Leaders meeting on Monday deplored the way the notice was issued, saying there was no public participation and leaders were left in the dark. They met as the Tana River, Isiolo and Marsabit (TIM) Forum. The notice was issued by Lands CS Faridah Karoney in August. The leaders included 18 MPs and senators. Marsabit Governor Mohamud Ali said the national government was imposing the process on the people of Isiolo and said they suspect foul play. “The process was against the spirit of the Constitution in which the public should be engaged before such decisions are approved,” he said. He said the content of the Gazette notice disregarded the interests of pastoralists. Saku MP Dido Raso, who chairs the TIM  Forum, said total adjudication brought about by the Gazette notice was unacceptable, adding all the region’s leaders demand revocation of the notice to allow for consultation by the Isiolo people. He said that any attempt to subdivide the land was opposed in pastoralist areas as herders could not graze their animals. Bura MP Ali Wario said the leaders sue if Lands CS Karoney doesn’t revoke the Gazette notice. They called for peaceful coexistence among communities competing for pasture and water. The leaders supported the Building Bridges Initiative either in Parliament or through a referendum. Isiolo Woman Representative Rehema Jaldesa thanked the national government for donating food and supplies to the people of Iresaboru and Gafarsa areas in Garbatula subcounty. Hundreds of families were displaced after the Ewaso Nyiro River overflowed and isolated the two villages. (Edited by V. Graham)
