Gospel singer Kambua gave birth through Caesarian section. The Rauka show host said she’s still recovering from the surgery, adding it takes time for the scar to heal. “This is me thanking God that I can fit into one of my pre-preggers dresses. My body has changed alot and I am embracing it all. I stretched in ways I never knew were possible! Isn’t God amazing? And then went through a CS (story for another day). Recovering from it is not a joke!” she wrote on Instagram. “I have chosen to be kind to myself. Giving myself the time I need to heal, and also to nurture my toto. I haven’t even told you about the edges I’ve lost because of breastfeeding! But I have no regrets. It’s all been worthwhile. Next year I will think about diets and workouts. (That baby pouch will need to go). But for now I’m counting my blessings, enjoying the chubby cheeks and snug clothes lol.” Addressing body-shamers, Kambua said, “Please be kind to your friends postpartum. There’s so much pressure to “snap back”, without considering that being alive after birthing a child is a miracle in itself. Watu wa, “umenona”, please have several seats over there...”
