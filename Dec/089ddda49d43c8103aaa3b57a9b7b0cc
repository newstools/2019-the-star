Former Sports CS Hassan Wario and other sports officials charged in Sh55 million Rio Olympics scandal have a case to answer, a Milimani court has declared. In her ruling, Anti-Corruption magistrate Elizabeth Juma said that after considering the evidence brought before her it emerged that the accused persons indeed have a case to answer. The ruling by the magistrate comes after 28 witnesses testified in the case where Wario faces six accounts of abuse of office. In October 2018, Wario denied the charges preferred against him. Also charged was Haron Komen, who was the director of administration in the ministry, and former finance officer Patrick Nkabu. Wario is accused of improperly facilitating six individualsâ€™ travel expenses to Rio Olympics, causing loss of public funds worth Sh5,846,346. The individuals include Adan Enow and James Singh, who are said to have pocketed Sh1,506,391. Others are Richard Bura and Monica Sairo, who allegedly got Sh918,391. Eunice Kerich and Samuel Njuguna are said to have taken home Sh498,391 each.
