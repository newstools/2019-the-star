Madrid’s San Silvestre Vallecana 10km once again offers world-class line-ups in both the men’s and women’s races tomorrow, exactly one year after race records were shattered at this Gold Label road race. At the 2018 edition, Jacob Kiplimo and Brigid Kosgei produced spectacular performances as they sped to 26:41 and 29:54 course records. The downhill nature of the course (5.5m per kilometre) meant that Kiplimo’s performance couldn’t count as a world record, but was still a notable run as it took 13 seconds off the previous race record set by Eliud Kipchoge back in 2006. For her part, Kosgei obliterated Gelete Burka’s previous course record by a full minute. Ruth Chepngetich will start as the woman to beat. The reigning world marathon champion is enjoying a brilliant 2019 after opening with an impressive 2:17:08 win in Dubai which places her fourth on the all-time world list. She then kept on with several half marathon victories topped by a 1:05:29 effort in Istanbul on 7 April. Tuesday’s will be the 25-year-old’s first outing since her Doha triumph and she’ll be keen to improve her 31:12 personal best. She’ll face stiff opposition from Ethiopia’s Helen Bekele Tola, who smashed her 10km best with a 30:47 run in Lausanne on 27 October. The 25-year-old has shown fine consistency over the marathon distance this year, clocking a 2:21:01 PB for second in Tokyo in March and 2:21:36 for fourth in Berlin in September. In the men's race, Turkey’s Aras Kaya, fresh from a silver medal at the European Cross Country Championships three weeks ago, should be tipped as one of the favourites. The 25-year-old is an accomplished cross country runner, with the 2016 European title and the 2018 bronze medal under his belt. He has not raced over 10km on the road yet but has a 27:48.53 personal best on the track. The Ugandan contingent will be headed by Mande Bushendich, 22, who finished third last year in 27:24. His set his 10km season’s best of 27:56 in Brunssum in March. He’ll be joined by compatriot Moses Kurong, who brings 59:50 half-marathon credentials to the line. While his quickest time on the track is 27:22.33, the 25-year-old has yet to dip under 28 minutes on the roads. The third Ugandan in contention will be Boniface Sikowo, a 3000m steeplechase specialist with an 8:25.91 career-best, who’ll be making his 10km debut. The 20-year-old competed at the World Championships in October but didn’t advance to the final. The in-form Belgian Bashir Abdi will also be a factor. The 30-year-old broke the Belgian marathon record in Chicago in October clocking 2:06:14. Abdi set a 15km PB of 42:29 in Heerenberg earlier this month and has a 27:36.40 career-best on the track. Toni Abadía, Fernando Carro, and Abdessadam Oukhelfen will carry Spanish hopes for a top-five finish. Abadía finished third here three times (2014/2016/2017) and holds the Spanish 10km road record of 27:48. Carro is the Spanish 3000m steeplechase record holder thanks to an 8:05.69 performance in Monaco last July while Oukhelfen, 21, arrives on the heels of a bronze medal in the U23 race at the European Cross Country Championships. The fight for the minor place on the podium should be fierce between Spain’s Carmela Cardama, Poland’s Katarzyna Jankowska and the Portuguese armada of Jessica Augusto, Salomé Rocha and Catarina Ribeiro. Cardama, 23, who is based in the US, broke the national indoor 5000m record in Boston earlier this month with a 15:25.41 performance. Meanwhile, Rocha clocked a 2:24:47 lifetime best at the London Marathon in April and was tenth at the European Cross Country Championships. Ribeiro, 29, finished runner-up here two years ago in a lifetime best of 32:41. The 38-year-old Augusto, the winner here in 2010, will also be in contention along with Jankowska, who brings 15:37:31 (5000m) and 32:31:40 personal bests to the line. The point-to-point course begins alongside Real Madrid’s Santiago Bernabeu stadium before finishing on the pitch of another football team, Rayo Vallecano, in Madrid’s southern suburbs. Forecasters predict a mild night on Tuesday with temperatures ranging between 8-10C and no rain expected. The mass race, which begins two-and-a-half hours before the main event, has drawn 40,000 entrants.
