The task of turning around the fortunes of National Super League side Talanta Fc has fallen squarely on coach Ken Kenyatta. Kenyatta, who parted ways with Ushuru in July this year, is known for his record-breaking performance in 2013 that led to the promotion of Ushuru to the Kenyan Premier League. Speaking in a meeting with the players and the club management led by Kenya Academy of Sports Director of Talent Development Douglas Ratemo, Kenyatta said he was ready for the task ahead promising to turn around their season. “I have a wealth of experience since my days as a player to my coaching days and I promise to work hard to help the club improve on the rankings,” he said. He, however, called on the players to work hard and give their all in order to help improve the performance of the club. “We are ranked 14th on the log with 18 points, 25 points off the league leaders. That means we have the daunting task of winning the next eight games to be back in contention for promotion. That will require a lot of sacrifice and hard work from all of us,” he said. On the upcoming transfer window, Kenyatta said he was not keen to bring in new players but hopes to use the available talent to move the team forward. Ratemo assured the players and the coach of his commitment to support them on and off the field to ensure they post good results. “We have a lot of confidence in coach Kenyatta and the entire playing unit and we are sure that with dedication and commitment, our performances will improve. Our desire is to see FC Talanta competing in the top league and we believe you have what it takes to get there,” he said. FC Talanta are winless in their last 10 matches, with their last win being in September, against Police FC, who are two points above them. The Communications Authority-sponsored club next host Shabana, who are four points above them (at 11th) on December 15.
