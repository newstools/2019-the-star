Former Arsenal striker and Danish international Niklas Bendtner said he was considering hanging up his boots for good after FC Copenhagen ruled out extending his four-month contract. Bendtner, who was convicted of assaulting a taxi driver last year, has scored only one goal in 17 matches. “Now I want to have a good think about my future and decide if I should try a new adventure in football or quit and start some new adventures in life,” Bendtner said in an FC Copenhagen statement. The 31-year-old, whose colourful personal life was covered in full by the tabloids, played for Premier League club Arsenal from 2005-14 and has represented Denmark 81 times. Bendtner joined FC Copenhagen from Norwegian side Rosenborg in September in an attempt to revive his career after unsuccessful stays at Serie A side Juventus and German side Wolfsburg. Bendtner was convicted of assaulting a taxi driver and sentenced to 50 days in jail in November last year by a court in Copenhagen.
