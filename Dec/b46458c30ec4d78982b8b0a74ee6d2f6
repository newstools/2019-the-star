The court has directed the DPP to file submissions in an application where City lawyer Assa Nyakundi is challenging his murder charge at the High Court. Justice Daniel Ogembo gave the Director of Public Prosecution more time to file the submissions and appear in court on February 25 for highlighting. Nyakundi, who is out on Sh300,000 bail, had been charged with manslaughter on April 26 but the DPP wants the charges changed to murder. Through his lawyers, the lawyer has opposed the move by the prosecution to have him charged with murder insisting that he had already been charged with manslaughter. He says the DPP cannot amount to two parallel prosecutions and that they should choose manslaughter which is still pending before a Kiambu court. Nyakundiâ€™s wife Lydia has also opposed the new charges saying as the victims, the family was not consulted by the DPP when they instituted new charged against her husband. Through her lawyer Dunstan Omari, she maintains that she is a victim in the matter and not a witness as had been alluded by the prosecution. However, the prosecution claims that she already recorded admissible evidence against the husband and they regard her as a witness. On May 2, a Kiambu court allowed the DPP to review manslaughter charges against Nyakundi. Nyakundi sought orders seeking to quash plans to withdraw the manslaughter charge. The lawyer is alleged to have killed his son Joseph Bogonko Nyakundi on March 17 in Nairobi in an incident which the lawyer termed as an accidental shooting. Nyakundi said he was trying to holster his firearm when he accidentally fired, shooting his son. Edited by R.Wamochie
