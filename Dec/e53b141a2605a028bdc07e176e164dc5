Nairobi City Stars coach Sanjin Alagic is seeking to beef up his squad in January in a bid to make their return to the Kenyan Premier League after three years in the cold. City Stars finished at the top of the National Super League first leg which came to an end last weekend. Alagic said the club had in the last four months scouted some players and hinted on axing those deemed surplus to requirement to pave way  for fresh blood. “We have to re-tweak the squad and add a few more players in certain departments,” added the Bosnia Herzegovina under-21 coach. Alagic admitted that despite amassing 43 points from 18 matches, the first leg was tough. “We achieved some targets and we head to next year with seven points ahead. There's quality opposition in the league but it’s all about proper planning and motivation that has kept us at the top," added the coach. He attributed the team's good show in the first leg to a seven-week pre season, quality and structured training as well as important build up friendly games in Kakamega and Kisumu. The tactician added: "This is a project that started in July and together with the office, we came out with a plan that began with signing quality players. When the season kicked off all the pre-planning began to show." City Stars lost their first match of the season over the weekend, after succumbing to a 1-0 defeat against Kibera Black Stars at Camp Toyoyo. “We missed lots of chances early in the game and this came back to haunt us as we scored once in the second half to win the game. We will take lessons from the loss, reflect over the holidays, and come back better for the second leg next year," the coach concluded.
