A minor accused of killing a Form 2 student in Naivasha two weeks ago using a knife is fit to stand trial following a mental assessment. The 17-year-old has been in custody for two weeks. He will be charged with murder at the High Court sitting in Naivasha. The suspect was arrested following the brutal attack on Valerie Njeri, 16.  According to the postmortem report, the girl was stabbed 17 times. She had been stabbed in the back, front and her throat slit. Traces of blood were found in the accused's room. The body of the girl was found dumped on a feeder road in a Naivasha estate. Njeri went missing the previous day from the parent’s posho mill, which she had been manning only for her body to be discovered the following day. Lawyer F I Mburu, representing the accused, sought to have him detained at Naivasha police station before taking a plea. “Since he was arrested, the suspect has been held at Naivasha police station, and we are seeking that he remains there until he takes his plea,” he said. In her ruling, Naivasha resident magistrate Esther Mburu directed that the minor remains at the police station until December 17, when he will take a plea. “As per the investigating officer, the mental and age assessments have been conducted and the accused can now take plea at the High Court,” she directed. The girl was buried last week, with leaders calling on parents to monitor the behaviour of their children during school holidays.
