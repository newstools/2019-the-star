Security has been beefed up in Northern Kenya with President Uhuru Kenyatta expected to open a military barracks in Garissa on Friday. This will be the first military barracks in the North-Eastern part of the country. The move is set to play a key role in improving security in the region which has been hit by attacks from the Al Shabaab militia. This comes a week after the militia killed at least 10 passengers who were traveling in Medina bus en route to Mandera. They flagged off the bus which had 56 passengers before separating the locals from the passengers. Among those who were killed were eight police officers who were reporting back to their work station in Elram in Mandera. Eleven suspects have been arrested in connection to the attack and are assisting the police in narrowing down to the attackers. The President will also reopen the Immigration offices in Garissa which was closed in 2015. The immigration center in Garissa will improve service provision to Garissa residents and those residing in other towns in northern Kenya. The locals have been traveling to other immigration centers located kilometers away to seek for passport processing and other services. Uhuru will also launch the new Garissa Solar Power Plant, sitting on 85 hectares of land and consisting of 206,232 solar photovoltaic panels. The solar plant has an installed capacity of 54 MW and presently generating 50 MW. The President will be accompanied by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i and other officials, including National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale who is Garissa Town MP.
