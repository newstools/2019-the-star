It was finally a sigh of relief for Kenyans as South Africa agreed to host the men and women's  Africa wheelchair basketball qualifiers for Tokyo Paralympic Games   from March 4- 14. The qualifiers,  which were initially planned for January during the-now-cancelled All Africa Para Games, was moved forward after Morocco declined to host the showpiece last month. With International Wheelchair Basketball having given a timeline of between January 15 and March 15 for the qualifiers, SA picked dates closer to the deadline to have an ample time to prepare. In the meantime, Kenya men's wheelchair basketball team is working on the shooting skills, especially for the sides' low pointers (classification) players. Assistant coach Sarah Onzere said their preparation is on the right track and they continue to fine-tune their game in all departments. "We are going on well with our training programme and I'm glad to say they are physically fit. However, we have our work cut out in terms of shooting prowess for the low pointers (ones and 1.5 classifications). Other areas that we need to put on more work are three-point shooting and screening," reported Onzere. Kenya were  fourth at the 2007 All Africa Games behind winners Algeria, silver medalists Egypt and third placed Morocco.
