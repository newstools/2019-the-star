A family from Thuura sublocation, Imenti North, is seeking justice after their daughter’s mysterious death two years ago. According to the family, Diana Mumbi who was a first year journalism student at Multimedia University died on November 18, 2017 at Kenyatta National Hospital but to date her killers have not been brought to book. Margaret Ayubu, an aunt of the deceased, said the family had made many visits to the DCI headquarters but they were told investigations were still being carried out. Ayubu pointed out that since the death of her niece, the family has not experienced peace of mind as they want the culprits arrested. Mumbi’s father Peter Mwangi said the family was shocked to learn of her death after trying to look for her for several days after she failed to respond to phone calls. “Our daughter is the last born in a family of four and had visited her sister in Nakuru after the university closed indefinitely. We are told that someone called her to Nairobi where she rushed leaving her personal effects at her sister’s place. That is the last time she was seen alive,” Mwangi said. Mwangi said that he was informed the daughter was brought to Kenyatta National Hospital unconscious by unknown persons and admitted for nine days. He made a report at Ongata Rongai police station about a missing person and was advised to make a similar report at Nakuru police station. He said when police tried to track his daughter’s phone, they found that she was in contact with one Ahmed said to be in Mariakani, Mombasa. He said police investigating the matter have been telling him that they were still pursuing the case although the said Ahmed was yet to be arrested.
