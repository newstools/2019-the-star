Trade CS Peter Munya and  Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung'wa on Friday engaged in a war of words on Twitter over the plight of milk farmers, which culminated in the former accusing the MP of rent seeking and speaking on behalf of Deputy President William Ruto. The tweet, which the CS later deleted, hit out at Ichung'wah over his criticism of the dairy sector. Ichung'wah had started by commenting on an article by the Daily Nation which said farmers in Nyandarua were pouring their milk over low prices and lack of access to markets. The article said market access had remained difficult because roads are impassable due to heavy rains. Milk prices have gone down, reaching as low as Sh17 per litre due to oversupply, a farmer was quoted as saying. Ichung'wah tweeted the photo and said, "These farmers will need school fees in January. They depend on their produce for the same. After the floods, there’s likely to be a drought. This produce could save lives then." The MP went on to tag Munya as well as Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa in his tweet. Munya shot back at Ichung'wah, accusing him of rent seeking. He also told Ichung'wah to direct his comments at the Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri. The MP hit back, telling Munya to keep his feelings out and address the matter at hand. KOT also reacted, accusing the politicians of failing to resolve the issue. Kenyans asked the two leaders to use their positions to create better terms for farmers.
