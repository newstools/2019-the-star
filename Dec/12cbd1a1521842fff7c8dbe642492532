WCB singer Queen Darleen tied the knot this week with her one-year lover Isihaka Mtoro as the second wife. "He is a Muslim man, even if I would have been married as a fourth wife, it wouldn't be a big deal. We have agreed, so there is no problem. I knew he had a wife," she said. However, Darleen and the man's first wife are not close. "I don't know whether the first wife knows me. He has never introduced us," she said. She said the marriage was rushed after her hubby paid her dowry.
