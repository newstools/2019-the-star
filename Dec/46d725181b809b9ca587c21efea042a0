A man was on Friday arraigned for attempting to use a stolen identification card to steal Sh200,000 from Kenya Women Finance Trust Bank. Belington Asirigwa was arraigned before Kibera senior resident magistrate Boaz Ombewa. The charge sheet says Asirigwa committed the offence on April 24, 2014 in the Kenya Women Finance Bank offices in Kawangware, within Nairobi county. Court documents say Asirigwa went to the bank and made an inquiry concerning the account number 1002715xxx belonging to Juliana Mangoki. He had the woman's ID card. The teller, Nancy Kawira, demanded to see the woman whom the accused said was outside and unwell. Asirigwa called in a woman who pretended to be unwell after being asked to give her mobile number with other information. On suspecting that the accused person was not genuine, she alerted the management who called the police and arrested Asirigwa. He was later arraigned, charged and was released on bond. The case was pushed to next month to allow the prosecution to align the witness who will testify in the mater.
