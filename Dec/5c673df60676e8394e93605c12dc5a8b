A section of leaders from the Rift Valley want the country to go to a referendum by August 2020 to amend the Constitution in line with proposals of the Building Bridges Initiative. Their counterparts from Western Kenya, however, say they are yet to decide their stand  on the matter. The Rift Valley leaders said an all-inclusive forum, bringing together political parties and stakeholders including religious bodies, should first be established. They said the forum would then establish a committee of experts which will spearhead the Constitution amendment process. “The CoE will then facilitate the collection of signatures and oversee the presentation of a constitutional amendment Bill to the relevant bodies including county assemblies ahead of the national referendum,” they said in a statement issued after a meeting in Kajiado county. The Rift Valley leaders included Governor Alex Tolgos and legislators Joshua Kutuny, Paul Sang, Naisula Lesuuda, William Kamket, Silas Tiren, Gladwell Cheruiyot, Raymond Moi, former Governor Isaac Ruto and former MP Nick Salat. As they made the announcement, 14 MPs from Western met at a hotel in Nairobi and said they will make their stand known at a later date. Nambale MP Sakwa Bunyasi who read out the statement said issued raised in the BBI report required further discussions and participation. “We will remain actively engaged in determining what is best for this country. We will not give any details at this juncture,” he said.
