The Muthaiga Golf Club leg of the 2019/2020 Safari Tour Golf Series earlier scheduled for December 14-18 has been postponed indefinitely. Making the announcement, Kenya Open Golf Limited (KOGL) director, Patrick Obath, said the decision was occasioned by the condition of the Muthaiga Golf Club course following the rains being experienced in the country in the past few weeks. “Due to recent rains, the Muthaiga Golf Club has received 284mm of rainfall over the last 10 days; leaving the course in a condition that is not suitable to hold a Safari Tour Golf Series event,” he said. He added: “This decision has been reached after careful deliberation and in consideration of both players’ safety and the tournament’s integrity and standards. A new date for the event will be communicated in due course.” The 2019/2020 season of the Tour has so far featured six competitions across Kenya and Uganda and in the process produced five different winners among them Greg Snow, Madalitso Muthiya, Tonu Omuli, Jastas Madoya and Dismas Indiza,who has won two tournaments.
