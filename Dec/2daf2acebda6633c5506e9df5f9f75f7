Cabinet Secretary of the National Treasury and Planning Ukur Yatani has urged the public to adopt the revised Georgetown agreement that appreciates the strides made since the signing of the Georgetown Agreement in 1975 that established the ACP Group. "The vision of the ACP Group remains solid in becoming a leading trans-continental organization propelled by pursuit for increased solidarity to improve the living standards of its peoples," Yatani said. He also stated that during the 8th ACP Summit held in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, our leaders identified three key areas that were expected to accelerate the benefits of our relations and partnerships, from equitable and sustainable development for ACP Countries and Peoples, enhancing the Role of the ACP Group in Global Governance for Development and peace, security and stability as essential elements for sustainable development. "Indeed, for Africa, it’s also an encouraging reminder of how far this continent has come, how much progress Africa and its partners have made together, how much distance we have bridged noting the pessimism that dogged the continent for decades and now the believe in the imminent growth, success and prosperity of Africa and it’s people," Ukur said. Ukur added that the 110th Session has a duty to consider and adopt the revised Georgetown Agreement which is expected to keep the vision of its founders alive and aligned to the current global trends. "As a country, we remain at the forefront in deepening and widening regional integration including the participation in the formation of various preferential trade areas, the latest being the African Continental Free Trade Area. We remain committed to multilateralism within the framework of World Trade Organization and the United Nations system," he said. He further stated that it's his sincere hope that everyone shall continue engaging in a stimulating exchange of ideas, and undoubtedly strike on broad solutions for the realization of shared prosperity of the people.
