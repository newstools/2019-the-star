A Ugandan court has awarded controversial activist and academic Stella Nyanzi 50m Ugandan shillings ($14,000; Â£11,000) for being stopped from travelling out of the country. Kampala high court on Monday awarded Nyanzi the money for violation of her right to movement, Uganda's Daily Monitor newspaper reported. Ms Nyanzi was blocked by the immigration department from leaving the country on 19 March 2017 to attend an academic conference in Amsterdam. She then sued for the infringement on her rights, and the loss of money she spent on visa fees, an air ticket and a hotel. In the judgment delivered on Monday, Lady Justice Henrietta Wolayo found the state in breach of Article 24 of the Constitution, which provides for respect to human dignity and protection from inhumane treatment, the Observer newspaper reported. Ms Nyanzi is known for her frequent anti-government posts on Facebook, some of which take the form of poems, and which are often laced with profanity. The activist is currently serving an 18-month sentence for insulting President Yoweri Museveni. During her sentencing in August, she attended via video link, against her will, and exposed her breasts in protest.
