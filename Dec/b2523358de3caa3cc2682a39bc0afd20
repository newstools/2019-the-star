Olympique de Marseille beat Girondins de Bordeaux 3-1 at home on Sunday to claim their sixth consecutive victory in Ligue 1 and consolidate second place in the table. Marseille prevailed thanks to second-half goals by Jordan Amavi, Morgan Sanson and Nemanja Radonjic after Bordeaux had gone ahead courtesy of a thunderous effort from Yacine Adli. Marseille have 34 points from 17 games and trail leaders Paris St Germain, who beat Montpellier 3-1 on Saturday and have one game in hand, by five points. Lille are third on 28 points as Bordeaux slipped to fifth on 26. Marseille’s Dario Benedetto was absent after he suffered a back injury in training with Valere Germain starting up front at the Stade Velodrome. Adli opened the scoring in the 31st minute with a 25-metre shot to reward Bordeaux, who made the better start. Marseille went close to equalising before the break but were denied by Bordeaux keeper Benoit Costil, who pulled off a couple of great saves. Three minutes into the second half, however, Amavi headed home from Dimitri Payet’s corner kick and Sanson gave the hosts the advantage on the hour with a fine curled shot. Substitute Radonjic wrapped it up with an effort from 10 metres that was deflected into his own net by Aurelien Tchouameni a minute into stoppage time to end Bordeaux’s five-match unbeaten run. Elsewhere, Nantes beat Dijon 1-0 to move up to sixth on 26 points while St Etienne suffered their second defeat under coach Claude Puel when they lost 3-1 at Stade de Reims. St Etienne are eighth on 25 points, one point and one spot ahead of Reims.
