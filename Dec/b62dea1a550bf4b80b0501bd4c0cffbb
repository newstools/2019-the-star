We don’t want new infections," he advised. Oyugi urged parents to monitor their children to prevent them from engaging in "social evils" that ma lead to unwarranted pregnancies and infections. He said lavish spending may also keep parents from properly catering for their children when schools open next year. “Parents should stay with and closely monitor their children, especially girls...
