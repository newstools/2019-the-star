As year 2019 draws to a close in three days' time, some of the most talked-about issues remain the war on corruption, the Building Bridges Initiative report and the Uhuru Kenyatta succession. But it is the war against corruption that has caught attention, not so much the subject but the dramatis personae involved. None other than Treasury CS has been dragged to court for alleged graft. So have several governors and captains of industry. We have long stopped being awed by millionaires. Being a billionaire is the in-thing. These are the people scared of sharing potholed roads with the hoi polloi and instead fly helicopters and executive jets to harambees and church functions to offload their ill-gotten wealth. President Kenyatta has certainly triggered a difficult to stop crackdown against graft.  As a result, there has been a lot of political noise from the mouthpieces of the merchants of graft. Some of them say the war is  "just a PR stunt" to lie to Kenyans that the war on corruption is gaining traction. All said, Kenyans expect convictions. They expect that the prosecution has watertight cases to send the thieves to jail for a long time and their ill-gotten wealth confiscated. This is our 2020 wish.
