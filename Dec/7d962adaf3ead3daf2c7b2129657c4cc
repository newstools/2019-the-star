Tinderet OCPD Christine Kola said the distilling equipment included six, 200-litre drums. The county has been experiencing days of downpours. Two of eight cows were rescued; the were among the eight swept away by mudslides in the Kapsimotwo area, Tindaret subcounty. On Tuesday, Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembea asked residents living along the escapement in Nandi county to move out to safe areas after many areas were cut off by raging floods. Natembea also said settlements in the Chepsangor hills and Kiptega villages were disasters waiting to happen. “People should stop cultivation and settling on these dangerous hills because they are prone to landslides,” Natembea told residents. He spoke after meetingh county commissioner Kutswa Olaka, six sub county commissioners and police commanders in Kapsabet. (Edited by V. Graham)
