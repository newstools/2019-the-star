Deputy President William Ruto left worshippers chuckling in a light moment when he advised men to address their wives using sweet nothings if they want to avoid problems in their homes. "I have heard a number of speakers up here addressing their wives by the term 'Mama'...that term can mean she's a mother to children... I think that's just a weakness of people from our area; we are a bit too modest," he said. Ruto continued, "Pastor, when introducing your wife, you should have said, this is my dear wife. Even calling her sweetheart is fine." He referred to Bishop Kosgei mentioning earlier that his wife is not amused when he fails to introduce her and added, that he would avoid such problems if he not only called her his wife, but rather his sweetheart. Ruto spoke at Chepngobob Methodist Church in Kericho county. After attending the service, Ruto took to Twitter to quote a Bible verse saying, "You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord’s coming is near. Don’t grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged. The Judge is standing at the door! ~ James 5:8-9."
