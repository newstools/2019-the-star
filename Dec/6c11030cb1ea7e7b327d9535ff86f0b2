Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) has sent two officials ahead of Athletics Kenya seminar set for between December 4 and 7 in Eldoret. With 112 marathoners and road runners set to start their meeting tomorrow, will be joined by a further 164 track and field athletes on Thursday for the four-day invite-only conference. According to Athletics Kenya Nairobi chairman Barnabas Korir,  there will be two IAAF’s Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) officials namely Aditya Kumar and Brett Clothier, who will specifically deal with anti-doping sensitisation. The A.K executive member said that most banned Kenyan athletes are marathoners and road runners and maybe that's why the AIU had to have a special day for them. “AIU selected the marathoners who will be taught on the first day and we are expecting them to get quality information on the anti-doping matters. And the event is mandatory for the invited athletes as well as the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games probables,” said Korir. Apart from the world-renown marathoners, junior road race runners like Norah Jeruto, Brilliant Jepkorir, Rodgers Kwemoi, Rhonex Kipruto among other juniors have been invited to the seminar. “These young athletes are the potential top runners in the future and they have to be imparted with knowledge before it's too late. We have to ensure that we groom them at a tender age,” added Korir. He added that some of the young runners are probables for 2020 Olympic Games and it will be good if they are well equipped with information on the dos and donts. “The young runners invited will most likely be in Tokyo for the 2020 Olympic Games and we have to nurture them today for a better tomorrow,” concluded Korir.
