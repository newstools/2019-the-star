Newly-promoted Orange Leonas will look to surpass Lakers' achievements in the just concluded Premier League season when the new one begins on February 29 next year. Leonas gained promotion to the top tier after finishing second in the Super League with 28 points, behind Wolverines, who had 32. The KHU development side has been challenged to outperform Lakers, who finished fourth in their debut season in the top flight. Lakers lost only three matches but gave the likes of 22-time champions Blazers a run for their money with a 2-2 draw before the 10-time African Cup of Club champions narrowly won 2-1 in the return fixture. Leonas were equally impressive in their division, losing just twice and winning eight matches in the eight-team league. Coach David Omwaka said they will need to finish in a respectable position and that his charges have what it takes to compete with the top teams. "Nobody expected Lakers to do what they did and that is the spirit of a team that means business. They were a well-oiled machine and played some good structured hockey and their fourth-place finish is no mean fate," said Omwaka. "We need to start on a high note and possibly perform better than they did. We do not want to suffer from 'first-season syndrome'.Â  The girls know what is expected of them and will be up to the task." Omwaka, who played for Parkroad, said they will look to add firepower in the attack in order to tear opponents apart. "The squad is good but two additions in the striking department will come in handy. We have identified a pair of players who will give us a solution and as well add the quality that the team already possesses," added Omwaka. While Lakers have been tipped to challenge for the title, Omwaka said his side are not yet ready to win the trophy.
