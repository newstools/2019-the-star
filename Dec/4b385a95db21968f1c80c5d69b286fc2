SIXTEEN media houses will battle for bragging rights in the third edition of the annual Betway Inter-media tournament this Saturday at the Moi Stadium Kasarani. The event, organised by the Sports Journalist Association of Kenya (SJAK) in collaboration with the betting firm, will see the teams muscle to scoop awards in five disciplines; a five-a-side football tournament, tug of war, sprints sack and egg races. The teams will be drawn into four pools on Thursday with each comprising four teams.  Among the competition rules proposed by SJAK, each media house will enter a maximum of ten participants. The tournament is open to all journalists from sports, business, political and feature desks, with an emphasis on gender representation. Podium finishers in each discipline will be awarded prizes. Additionally, top performers in each event will earn points for their respective teams. At the end of the tournament, the points will be tallied to decide the winning media house. Betway have injected Sh 850, 000 into the organisation of the one day tournament. The firm's country manger Leon Kiptum lauded the contribution of sports journalists in the developing sports through publishing the success and plight of sportsmen. “We are glad to be part of the event this year. We appreciate the input of sports journalism in the development of sports. You have done a tremendous job in your responsibility to tell the story not only those that touched on our brand but many that have gone to shape the narrative of what sports represents in our country,’’ he said. SJAK president Chris Mbaisi said: “I thank Betway for coming on board as this is a sign that they appreciate sports journalists and what they do. We look forward to having a great and fun day. "
