Flood victims in Muhoroni subcounty, Kisumu, have received donations worth Sh575,000 from well wishers for Christmas. More than 1,200 people displaced by floods in Achuodho village benefited from food and non-food items on Thursday. Items worth Sh350,000 were donated by West Kenya Sugar Company in partnership with the Kenya Sugarcane Growers Association (Kesga). The company donated cooking oil, sugar and bar of soap to the victims. They also gave out sanitary pads worth Sh25,000 to female victims. The association secretary general Richard Ogendo said they set up a medical camp costing Sh200,000. "We came to stand with our brothers and sisters who were affected by floods. They still need more support," Ogendo said. He appealed to well wishers to continue supporting those affected. He lauded the company for the donations. Many victims were left homeless following heavy rains witnessed in Kisumu and across the country. Ogendo said victims were still living in pathetic conditions and asked the national government to aid in building houses. He further urged residents in flood-prone areas to move to safer grounds and evacuation centres. Ogendo asked the national and county governments to find a permanent solution to perennial floods. "We want urgent building of dykes along the rivers in Kisumu," he said.
