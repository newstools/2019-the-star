The United States of America ambassador to Kenya Kyle McCarter has promised to  collaborate with Kenyan government to improve sports in the country. While on a  tour of Global Sports Communication Training Camp in Kaptagat, McCarter said the two nations can be sporting giants if they work together. “National Basketball Association will be visiting Kenya to check on the sport and see how they can help improve and make it better. Basketball is becoming big sport in Kenya and we shall have NBA delegation visiting the country to try  and see how we can work together in terms of improving the sport,” said McCarter. McCarter also met with Olympic and world marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge. “This was a private visit and I wanted to come and have a feel of where the athletes train for them to be successful. We wanted to meet Kipchoge not because he is a world record holder but because he is a good example to the future generation,” said McCarter. The ambassador promised to continue supporting Kenyan athletes in a bid to boost integrity in sports. Only last Sunday, Kenyans Titus Ekiru and Margaret Muriuki won the Honolulu marathon with course records and McCarter admitted that the country had produced world leading athletes. He cited Kipchoge as an example to many runners both in Kenya and the rest of the world. “At this time, I must say that Kipchoge serves as the best example to many athletes. He has shown some leadership skills,” said McCarter. Kipchoge said it was a privilege to host the ambassador who wanted to see where he has been training with his colleagues. “It’s an honour to receive the envoy in the camp because he wanted to know where we reside as we train and we are grateful,” said the Olympic champion.
