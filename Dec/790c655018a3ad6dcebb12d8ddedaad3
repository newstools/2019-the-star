West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo has said he cannot pay for work not done. He castigated acting Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani for releasing a report without getting the real situation on the ground. Governor Lonyangapuo asked Treasury CS to apologise for releasing a misleading report. “The CS should come out clearly over the report since you cannot compel counties to pay for projects that are not genuine,” he said. Lonyangapuo said most of the projects that were undertaken by the former regime were marred by corruption, inflation of figures and were not completed. “My government will not pay for some projects since I don’t want to violate the Constitution. Most of the project work done is not equivalent to the sum of money allocated to the project” he said. He vowed to go to court and challenge the report, saying the county government won’t pay for anything whose end product can’t be seen. He urged government officials residing in Nairobi to visit counties and get a true picture of things on the ground. Lonyangapuo gave an example of a contractor who was supposed to build staff houses in Masol for Sh5.8 million. He said nothing has been done. “I visited the site and the contractor has done nothing and you expect my government to pay for such projects. My government doesn’t condone corruption and I will not be forced to pay for such ghost projects,” he said. He asked government officials to allow EACC to carry out its constitutional mandate and stop compelling counties to pay for ghost projects.
