At least two people have been confirmed dead following the collapse of a six-storey residential building in Tassia Estate, Embakasi East constituency. Nairobi county regional commissioner Wilson Njenga on Friday said the exact number of people who died has not yet been established since rescue operations are still ongoing. The building caved in at 8am and the number of people who were inside at the time is still unknown. Njenga clarified that the number of houses in the building was 57 and not 46 as earlier reported. The bodies were taken to City Mortuary. "So far, we can confirm the safe evacuation of eight people who have been rushed to Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital and bodies of the two deceased taken to City Mortuary, " Njenga said. Kenya Red Cross posted on Twitter that it had rescued 11 people from the rubble. "Specialised search and rescue teams continue with operations. Psychosocial support services and a tracing desk have been set up a block away from the incident," Red Cross tweeted. In the morning, the Kenya Defence Forces led a rescue operation assisted by local residents. Embakasi East MP Babu Owino lauded reinforcements by the government, particularly KDF soldiers .
