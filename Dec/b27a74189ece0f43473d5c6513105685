Kimilili-based Rangers men’s handball team are targeting maximum points in the second part of the season when they resume their matches in January. Rangers have been in sensational form with nine wins and one loss in ten matches. The youthful side has collected 18 points to rank fourth in the 25-team league, behind Strathmore, Black Mamba and National Cereals and Produce Board NCPB. Around this time last season, the self-sponsored outfit were unbeaten after 12 matches. Strathmore and Boomerang have also lost once while seasoned Black Mamba, NCPB and Ulinzi remain the only unbeaten sides. Rangers inflicted league leaders Strathmore with their first loss of the season and suffered a surprise defeat against inconsistent Saint Paul’s University. Rangers boast a pool of players drawn from Kimilili and Chesamis Boys High Schools. Other members of the team have been acquired from Masinde Muliro and Kibabii universities. Coach Gerald Juma insists the team will fight for the national title but indicated that a top-three finish will not be a bad performance either. Rangers finished fifth last season with 33 points from 22 matches. The team needs only 16 points to surpass that tally. He said the improvement in the league will instil belief in his charges to outperform themselves in every match. Rangers play once a month due to inadequate funds to travel to Nairobi on a weekly basis and Juma hinted at intensifying their style of play as well as making a few adjustments on their right-wing players.
