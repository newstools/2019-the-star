The Embu council of elders are studying the Building Bridges Initiative report  to guide members and prevent political influence. Chairman Andrew Ireri on Saturday led officials from all the subcounties in going through the report’s proposals clause after clause. Speaking at Majengo mosque hall in Embu town Ireri said they had decided to read the report together and compare it with the Constitution to find out where the report needs to be changed. After discussing the report they will later meet with all members and come up with a common stand. Ireri said the officials will form a committee to collect views from members of the council before presenting their views to the task force  appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. Ireri said they will not rely on politicians whom accused of always misleading citizens to take a stand that benefits them to cling to power. “We resolved that we shall not wait for the politicians to guide us on the report because they usually come to confuse and mislead  the public to do things that will enable them get seats or cling to power, claiming that is what the common man wants leaving him to suffer,” Ireri said. Council officials regretted that after the report was read politicians took different stands depending on their selfish interests. They blamed the local leaders for having rushed to issue a press statements on their stand on the BBI report without even seeking the views of the people.
