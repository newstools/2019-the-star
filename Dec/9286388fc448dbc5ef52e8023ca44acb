The Teachers Service Commissionâ€™s plan to transfer 7,000 principals, their deputies and head teachers ahead of school re-opening in January should consider their age, marital status, health conditions and other social concerns. CEO Nancy Macharia defended the policy saying it will improve teaching administration in schools as head teachers will not serve in their home counties or be in the same school for more than nine years. Macharia said teachers with medical conditions and those aged above 56 will not be transferred under the delocalisation policy. Critics observe that tutors above 50 years should be left at home as they plan to exit the service as most of them are preoccupied with homesickness and see it as punitive. Transfers should not separate families.  Keroka
