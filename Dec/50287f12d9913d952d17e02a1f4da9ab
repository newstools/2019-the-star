A suspect shocked a female magistrate after he touched his manhood for at least two minutes while standing in the dock. It was not immediately established what pushed the suspect to do so but the magistrate decided he shouldn't continue doing that in her courtroom. The suspect, before prolonging his hand to the valley of mangoes and oranges, initially raised his hand for some seconds and quickly changed his tact and touched his ‘property’. “Wewe toa mkono hapo, unashika nini? [Hey, you! Get your hand off your groin. What are you touching?)" the magistrate asked. The magistrate then told him to leave the dock immediately and go call his lawyer. This was after the suspect said he was in the dock to wait for an advocate, who was to represent him. “Where is your lawyer, toka hapo kwenda umuite. Enda, tafadhali," the magistrate said. If remarks by an investigating officer at a Nairobi court are something to go by, then all men with female police officers should know that their wives are ‘well’ at their workplace. This after the officer told his colleague that a "female police officer is a male police officer's property". At first, it wasn't clear what the officer meant by the word property until he said ‘far wife’. “My wife is far but you know female officers are like my saviour bana, changamka,” the officer joked. His colleagues broke into laughter that was cut short as soon as the magistrate entered the courtroom. A suspect clicked and attempted to quarrel with a Nairobi magistrate over a delayed case. He asked why key witnesses have failed to appear and testify, thus delaying the matter in court. The man who seemed composed told the magistrate that he cannot keep on coming to court daily and the small girl and his mother are at home "planning how to come to this court and kill me". “Ongea tu vizuri tunakusikiliza, sema sasa? the magistrate said. The magistrate gave a near date for his case to proceed.
