The Senate is trying to get Kenya to sell its coffee to America directly to boost farmers' earnings. Speaking in Embu on Wednesday, Senate Agriculture Committee chairman Njeru Ndwiga said he led a team to the US two weeks ago to start a Kenyan Coffee Auction in America. Ndwiga, who is also the Embu Senator, travelled with deputy Senate Speaker Kithure Kiindiki and several other members of his committee. He said the reserve price put forward for Kenya’s coffee was four and a half dollars per pound, which translates to 9.9 dollars per kg. "The main problem facing Kenyan coffee is that roasters in America keep on looking for the coffee but it’s never available because it’s very expensive," Ndwiga said. "Despite it being costly in America and other countries, when it comes to the farmer, he gets almost nothing and is poor." The senator said they are looking at the issue. They have started from the market and want to go down to the society to unlock hurdles that contribute to farmers getting poor payments for their coffee. Ndwiga said when the coffee leaves the society in parchments, it goes to the millers, who are also the marketers and collude with buyers to make very big profits, leaving the farmer with very little profit. He said tea has also been hit by a crisis because nobody asks the Kenya Tea Development Authority anything since the Kenya Tea Board was removed. Ndwiga said KTDA controls everything in the subsector, including the payments, and that the farmer is given what is available and nobody can ask a question. He said already, the Senate has passed a law to bring back the tea board, saying he doesn’t know how far it has gone at the National Assembly. Ndwiga said the Senate wants to ensure there is somebody who can be accountable when things in the sub-sector go wrong, when farmers cry over poor prices.
