National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale has lashed at Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua after claiming his life is in danger. Mutua had earlier on Monday said Duale and Elgeyo Marakwet Kipchumba Murkomen had threatened him for 'fighting' Deputy President William Ruto politically. But Duale did not take the claims lightly as he hit back at Mutua saying that he is an attention seeker. "Governor Mutua is at it again seeking attention with the most fictitious allegations that can only fit in his failed Cobra Squad TV show, you will not gain relevance by shouting the names of leaders who have achieved more than you can ever do. Focus on Machakos, Mutua," Duale said. Via Twitter on Monday, Duale said Mutua cannot use his name to increase his dwindling political shares in the village. "The truth is, attention seekers are looking for validation. They want to know they are worthy... We play a different league. Wacha vindiyo, cinema na vipenderee," he said. This comes an hour after Murkomen also hit out at Mutua over the claims. The Senate Majority Leader said Mutua is writing another episode of his 'cobra squad series'. "Having failed spectacularly as a leader he turned himself into a Joseph Goebbels of his county government," Murkomen said. The Machakos County boss who also accused Ruto of threatening him added that his threats have been linked to his ambitions to vie for the presidency during the 2022 general elections. Mutua is one of the politicians who have expressed the ambition to challenge Ruto for the State House race in 2022.
