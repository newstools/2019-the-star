A cholera outbreak has been reported in Kirinyaga county just as locals were preparing to celebrate this year's Christmas. County director of Health Dr George Karoki said the disease was discovered last week in various parts of Mwea. In a public notice dated December 20, Karoki cautioned residents against eating hawked foods along the roads and drinking dirty water. He has also said residents should use latrines, observe hygienic standards and ensure they boil water before drinking. “We are appealing to anyone showing signs or symptoms of this disease to report to the nearest health facility for testing and management before it is too late,” Karoki said in the notice. Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri, however, downplayed the outbreak maintaining only three cases had been detected within the outlying areas of Mwea and had been managed. “It’s true there is a reported outbreak of cholera in our county. The situation has since been managed. Three cases were positive,” he said. Speaking at Kimbimbi market during the opening of a drug rehabilitation centre, Ndambiri blamed the recent heavy rains which raised the water table and submerged pit latrines in Mwea. “You see we have high water tables in Mwea and due to the excessive rains, all the pit latrines were submerged and the water thrashed out the filth which has since caused the outbreak,” he said. Ndambiri, however, declined to comment on the uncontrolled food hawking in the towns and markets in the area that stakeholders in the hospitality industry blame for the outbreak. “You find a hawker retailing sausages, samosas, chapatis and kachumbali right in front of your eatery in total disregard of all the public health hygiene requirements as the county enforcement department turns a blind eye on the matter,”  James Mwai, a hotelier at Kagio town said. Ndambiri said all measures to contain the deadly disease have been put in place and that there are enough drugs in all health facilities in the area.
