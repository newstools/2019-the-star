President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday launched over 8000 housing units for United Nations staff in Machakos as part of his agenda on Affordable Housing. Habitat Heights at Lukenya in Machakos County— one of the Strategic Partners’ projects— will deliver 8,888 units. Habitat Height is the first project developed under the Memorandum of Understanding between the State Department for Housing and Urban Development and UNOPs in September 2018 to develop 100,000 housing units. The project is being undertaken by AFRA Holdings Limited through its local subsidiary Singapura Developers LTD (Kenya) in conjunction with Housing Finance. Speaking at the launch, Uhuru said the government is committed to increasing home-ownership in Kenya. “The delivery of the houses promoted under the Affordable Housing Programme initiative demonstrates the government’s commitment to delivering affordable housing which is one of the Big 4 Agenda priority areas,” Uhuru said. He added that the government has spent the last 18 months to lay the groundwork for affordable housing by addressing some of the systemic issues that have made housing unavailable and unaffordable in urban areas and ever-growing peri-urban areas. The Affordable Housing Programme is an initiative by the Kenyan Government as one of the pillars under the 'Big 4 Agenda’, which ensures that low and middle-income households have access to decent and affordable housing. Under the Programme, the government is set to enable private developers to construct 500,000 housing units to meet the latent demands for houses in the low and middle-income category. Developers and potential homebuyers under the Affordable Housing Programme are set to enjoy various incentives including tax breaks as stipulated in the Financial Act 2019.
