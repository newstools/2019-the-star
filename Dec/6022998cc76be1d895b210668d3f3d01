Tyler Mbaya, popularly known as Baha in the former TV drama series 'Machachari', is set to celebrate with less privileged children at the Makimei Children's’ Home. The actor will also be holding a Tyler Mbaya Christmas fans Meet and Greet at the TRM this weekend. This will also double up as a pick-up point for foodstuff and clothes in support of a children’s home close to his heart. In the Christmas spirit, he urges his fans to bring what they can in support of this noble cause. Tyler will be supported by his fellow influencers like Foi Wambui, Shaq the Yungin, Joyce Maina, Martin Kimathi and Anita Nderu. This comes just after a win at the MachaWood awards. This initiative is in partnership with his Management Company Moonsun Pictures International.
