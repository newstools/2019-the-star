Budalangi traders have appealed to the Busia county government to open a toilet at the market that has been closed to the public or else they will stop paying levies. Former market chairman Albert Okuku who operates a welding workshop at the centre said the county government had ignored their calls to open the toilet that has been closed for three years. Okuku spoke to the Star at Budalangi trading centre on Sunday. The traders said the closure of the public toilet at the Sh2.7 million bio-centre facility has forced them to use a filthy public toilet constructed by the defunct Busia county council. “This toilet is stinking hence the fear of a cholera outbreak,” the former market chairman said. Okuku appealed to the county government to construct permanent stalls for traders to cushion them from huge losses whenever it rains.
