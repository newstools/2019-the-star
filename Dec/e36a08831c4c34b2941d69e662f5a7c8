The historic Fort Jesus Museum has reported a low guest turnout despite the festive season nearly reaching its peak. This December, the museum has received 11,121 guests compared to 13,711 last year. The difference of the 2,590 guests, which was expected to be much higher, has been blamed on harsh economic times experienced in the country. The museum has decried a major decrease in local guests who mostly surpass international visitors. Speaking to the Star in her office in the Museum on Tuesday, chief curator Fatuma Twahir said, “This year, it is not as busy as it was last year and a reflection is being seen on local visitors." Twahir said many have given priority to basic needs over travel and comfort due to the harsh economic times. Last December, the museum received 11,262 local tourists against this year's 8,835. International tourists have, however, increased from 501 last year to 668 this year. The reduced numbers have also affected businessmen around the area. From selling artefacts to clothes and different types of foods, the traders complain of a downfall to their businesses. Some have been forced to double the prices of their products to meet their daily target. Ahmed Mnito who owns a cafe said it is challenging this year. “We restocked handsomely, therefore, at the moment we have got plenty of stock but business is down and many are complaining that they are preparing for January to take their kids to school,” he said. Mnito said they have laid down many catchy offers of reducing prices "but visitors are still not flocking as expected". Swaleh Mohamed has blamed low turnout of visitors on the SGR monopoly. “SGR has destroyed the Mombasa economy, many have been sacked. Almost 50,000 people here have lost their jobs who have families so they have been forced to relocate,” the trader said. To mitigate the losses, however, different entertainment events have been organised for Christmas Day and New Year's. Edited by R.Wamochie
