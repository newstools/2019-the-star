The Tunza Family Health Network last Wednesday celebrated 10 years of providing quality affordable health care to all. The network was established in December 2008 to serve the vulnerable and underserved populations. It has 415 member facilities in 42 out of the 47 counties. When it was launched, family was the flagship service. With funding from donors, Tunza, a social franchise under Population Services Kenya, has supported more than 10 health areas with more focus on reproductive health and promotive health. With the support of the Health Ministry, more than 3,500 healthcare providers in 1,200 private facilities have benefited from a wide range of comprehensive training in areas of family planning, cervical cancer, HIV, safe motherhood, hypertension, diabetes, tuberculosis and integrated management of childhood illnesses.
