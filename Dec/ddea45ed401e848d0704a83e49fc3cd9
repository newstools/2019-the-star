The Busia Beach Management Unit (BMU) Network has offered to sponsor 214 form one  students. The money is from the proceeds realized from the Fish Cage Investment support they received from Busia County Governor Fisheries Department. Speaking after meeting to deliberate on how best to plough back profits, the Network chairman  Sylvester Kaiywa said the recipients of the sponsorship will benefit licensed fishermen's children. "Each student will receive a scholarship of Sh7,000 upon proof of being a child of registered fisher and production of form one admission form," he said. The meeting resolved to set aside 50 percent of the returns from the cage investment to be used towards education scholarships. Priority will be given to students are those joining Form One next year with the BMU executives of all the 20 Beaches tasked to list all the fishermen's children. Each BMU will contribute Sh14,000 annually beginning 2020 towards supporting the scholarship program. Kaiywa thanked the County Government for the initial investment and for providing an enabling environment to fishermen operating on Lake Victoria.
