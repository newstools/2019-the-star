Chief of the Defence Forces has praised KDF troops serving in Africa Union Mission in Somalia. General Samson Mwathethe who made a visit to troops in Somalia on Sunday,noted that it was because of the soldiers’ dedication to duty that Kenya is safe. “Even when you are here, we want you to know that we are thinking of you, we can never forget you. We wish you well and success in the execution of your mandate in Somalia,” Mwathethe noted. Mwathethe told the soldiers that peace in Somalia translated to peace in Kenya. “We are in Somalia because we know that if Somalia is free of Al Shabaab and terrorism, Kenya will also be free of the scourge," he said. He asked the soldiers to ensure that they destroy the enemy. "Our actions and successes here will safeguard a Kenya, devoid of fear of terror attacks that have from time to time been launched at home,” he said. Commander Kenya Navy, Maj Gen Levi Mghalu commended them for keeping the Kenyan flag flying high through their valor and for the sacrifices they have made. “I commend you for the very good work that you are doing here. Kenya Navy will continue to assist you, to the best of our capability," he said. Last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta said Kenyan troops will remain in Somalia until al Shabaab militia are neutralised. “In pursuance of this objective and that of the international community, our troops will continue being part of Amisom until such a time that this objective has been achieved,” the President said.
