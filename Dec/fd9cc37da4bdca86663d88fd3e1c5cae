 Flood victims in Nyakach and Nyando in Kisumu county have benefitted from  Sh2 million donations from well-wishers. The more than 2,500 households received cooking oil and bar soaps worth Sh1.5 million from Pwani Oil Products Limited in partnership with Pramukh UN Environmental Goodwill Ambassador, Soko Bila Waste Foundation and Kisumu Community Response Team. Lake Victoria South Water Works Development Agency also made donations worth Sh500,000. The agency's board chairman Erick Okeyo handed over the items to the response team for distribution. Pwani Oil donated more than 5,000 liters of cooking oil and over 3,000 kilograms of multipurpose bar soap to the victims. Pwani Oil Commercial director Rajul Malde said beneficiaries were in Nyamaso, Ombaka, Ogenya, Ayweyo, St Aloyce Gem Rae, Sango Buru, Sango Rota, Achuodho and Abwayo areas that were heavily flooded. Each household received two liters of cooking oil and one kg of bar soap. “Our hearts go out to everyone affected by the floods. Through the donation, we hope to somehow alleviate the distress experienced by the victims. We pray for their safety and well being,” Malde said. The donations were handed over to Soko Bila Waste Foundation founder Suzanne Owiyo and response team for distribution. Owiyo lauded Pwani for their humanitarian support. “We are grateful to Pwani for coming on board to support our efforts. You have come at a time when victims are in dire need of urgent assistance. This will help put a smile on the faces of victims this festive season,” Owiyo said. Oron called for more humanitarian support. “We continue to appeal for well-wishers to join us. More is still needed especially food, bedding, and drugs,” he said. He said those displaced were living in pathetic conditions as some sleep on the floor. "We are undertaking medical camps in rescue centres," Oron said. The response team has been donating food and non-food items such as mattresses and blankets to those affected.  edited by p. obuya
