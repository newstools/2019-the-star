 Nzoia Sugar Company has been given 14 days to pay contracted cane suppliers failing which farmers will boycott supplying sugarcane to the miller. The Keny National Federation of Sugarcane Farmers on Wednesday issued a 14-day strike notice to the company, saying farmers will be mobilised for the boycott if the demands are not met. KNFSF branch chairman for Bungoma Stephen Walupi said farmers were owed Sh300 million in unpaid arrears. He said the debt should be paid before any privatisation talks start. “We have already notified the relevant authorities over the impending strike to press for farmers' payments,” Walupi said. The official asked the government to fulfill its promise to offset farmers' dues. Nzoia Sugar Company Board of Directors Chairman Joash Wamang’oli confirmed that contracted to the state-owned miller have not been paid arrears totaling Sh330 million. He cited financial difficulties caused by a lack of cane to crush and market for the product. He said cheap sugar imports had flooded the market. Wamang’oli said the miller also owes Sh120 million to over 1,000 employees in salaries for the last four months. “The management is aware of the challenges the farmers are facing and we are working on prompt payments,” he said.  edited by p. obuya
