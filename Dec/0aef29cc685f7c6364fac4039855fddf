Rapper King Kaka has continued to receive both praise and criticism following the release of his 'Wajinga nyinyi' (stupid ones) song which speaks about graft in Kenya. A few hours after the release of the song, he said he would pull it down. He took to Instagram on Saturday to say, "Taking the video down until a few things are sorted." However, the song is yet to be pulled down. On Sunday, the rapper said he needs protection following the song which explicitly mentioned top politicians alleging they were responsible for graft which was killing the country. He took to Twitter to say, "All I can say is I need protection and prayers. Please." The song also addresses the state of the economy, healthcare and poor living conditions of many Kenyans. He also took a jibe at controversial pastors. Politicians and other personalities expressed their views on the song, some praising him for boldness, while others saying there were better ways of expressing his frustration.
