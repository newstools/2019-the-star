The national Affirmative Action Fund is too little to substantively help women, youth, disabled persons and needy children, Embu Woman Representative Jane Wanjuki has said. She called it "a drop in the ocean" Wanjuki says the Sh6 million for each county cannot effectively support those groups and provide bursaries for needy children. The fund cannot cater for civic education, establish gender-based violence rescue centres, cater for talent development and emergency response, as expected, she said. Wanjuki called the fund insignificant compared to the National Government Constituency and Ward Development funds "since it targets beneficiaries countrywide". She spoke at Manyatta where she gave youth self-help groups 20 car washing machines to start income-generating businesses; avocado seedlings to farmers and umbrellas to traders operating in open places. NGCDF receives more than  Sh100million and WDF Sh20 million each year, the MP said, despite the population of beneficiaries targeted being smaller than those targeted by NGAAF. Wanjuki said women representatives face difficulties trying to explain to people their constraints in carrying out projects as many people think there are more funds. The legislator urged the government to increase the funds. She said unemployment prompted her to start a car-wash machine programme to help youth groups. Wanjuki said giving hand-outs to the youth would not eliminate poverty. “After thinking hard and seeking views from my advisers and residents,  l found it best  to enable the youth to fish rather than giving them fish." The lawmaker said the only thing that will curb high crime and immorality is to provide youth with education and other skills so they can work and give some without jobs money and equipment to start businesses. She said she will provide car-wash machines to 20 youth groups in each of the county’s four subcounties from the NGAAF funds. Edited by R.Wamochie
