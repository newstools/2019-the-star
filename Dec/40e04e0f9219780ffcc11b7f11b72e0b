Rayvanny has said his new song Naogopa is his original work. He denied claims he stole the song from an upcoming artist, saying he recorded it in 2014. "I feel that the government should help us here because it has become too much. People are suing others to look for attention," the Kwetu hitmaker told Bongo 5. "I hustled for six to seven years to be where I am. I have worked hard. [That] one stupid person may come out to destroy your brand hurts." Rayvanny said he wrote the song before he joined Diamond Platnumz's record label, WCB Wasafi. "That's my song. I recorded the song in 2014. I wasn't even at WCB. At the time, I was hanging out with Ya Moto Band. Now, it looks like I stole a song from a young artist looking for space in the industry," he said. "I can never steal a song. I can write even a hundred songs. Just a piece of advice to artistes here is no shortcut to success."
