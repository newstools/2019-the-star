Residents of Githunguri plan to hire garbage collectors and dump waste in Kiambu subcounty offices if waste isn't collected daily. On Monday, they staged a peaceful demonstration in Githunguri town demanding the resignation or immediate dismissal of county executive committee members for Water and Environment, and roads as well as the subcounty ward administrator. Resident Ann Wanjiru presented the residents' petition to the subcounty administrator's office. It was received by Francis Gitau. She called the garbage a health hazard. "There are huge piles of garbage is market areas, outside businesses, bus parks, the hospital, parking lots and in outskirts of Githunguri town," she said. "We have complained of commercial buildings releasing sewage into the drainage whenever it rains, and many children are getting sick. There is afoul smell all over with nothing being done by the authorities," Wanjiru said. Vegetable seller John Kamau at Githunguri market said the smell is foul because garbage has not been collected for more than a month. "I complained to the subcounty administrator but I was told that the garbage truck was broken and trucks in the other six subcounties were grounded for lack of petrol. Noting can be done at the moment," he said. In the petition, the residents demand daily garbage collection. If their demands are not met, they will hire private garbage collectors and dump the waste at the subcounty offices, they said. (Edited by V. Graham)
