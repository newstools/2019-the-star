Top athletes from Nyamira and Kisii Counties have confirmed their participation in the annual Gusii Sports Legends cross country  set for Friday at Kebirichi in Nyamira County. Gusii Sports Legend public relations officer, Naftali Mayoyo, said more than 300 athletes are expected to race in the event to be held at Kebirichi Primary School in Gachuba ward. The annual event is organised by Gusii Sports Legends which brings together retired and active athletes. The organisation was founded by 1972 4x400m Olympic gold medalist the late Robert Ouko. Among the top athletes expected are Dickson Simba and Edwin Mokua who are expected to renew their rivalry while the senior women’s race has attracted experienced Teresa Omosa, Lorna Nyabochoa and Nancy Kerage among others. “We expect more athletes to race at Kebirichi. This will be a perfect opportunity to close the year and prepare for the ongoing cross country season,” said Mayoyo who is currently based in the US. Mayoyo, a former athlete, said there will be four main categories  including  senior men's 10km, women's  8km for junior men and 6km for junior women. Mayoyo said the legends have also lined up more events among them Manga Cross Country which was founded by Ouko, Kebabe cross country courtesy of Gusii Athletics Legends director Alfred Momanyi and Nyanturago track and field which was founded by Olympian Dan Omwanza. “As legends, we came together and agreed to have these events as one way of giving back to community and also restoring our lost glory in  athletics in Gusii land,” said Mayoyo. He said plans are afoot to launch a sports talent academy at Kebirichi.
