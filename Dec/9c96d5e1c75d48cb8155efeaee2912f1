Former National Super League side Green Commandos has appealed to well-wishers and cooperate bodies for support as they at making history by becoming the only learning institution to play in Kenyan Premier League. While unveiling their new kits, chairman Isaac Kwoba said Green Commandos have remained one of the major sporting institutions not only in the Western region but in Kenya country and the East and Central Africa region and need support to perform to their capacity. “We call upon the community to support the team as they embark on a long and tiring journey back to the National Super League," said Kwoba. “We have a very rich history going by a large number of players we have produced not only in soccer but also in other sporting disciplines. We, however, feel that we have not achieved our goal and objectives hence the need to invest in good structures that will sustain the project.” Kakamega School Principal Gerald Orina lauded the school alumni for the unfailing support they have offered to the team over the years “Allow me to extend my special gratitude to the alumni who have come out and sacrificed a lot in supporting the team. We ask you to continue doing so and bring more friends to support the team,” Orina stated Kwoba also assured of good results in the school’s competitions next season and appealed to the fans to remain united. Green Commandos are currently featuring in Football Kenya Federation Division One league after being relegated from the NSL.
