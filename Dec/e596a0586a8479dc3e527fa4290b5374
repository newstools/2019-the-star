Three community water schemes in Busia county have received 495 meters to expand water coverage in their areas of jurisdiction. The three beneficiaries include Lugulu-Bwaliro with 176 meters, Budongi with 119 meters and Ogallo with 200 meters through the Kenya Integrated Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Project (KI-Wash-USAid). Water Chief officer Moses Weunda said the meters will help reduce the amount of non-revenue water. "Water meters are also the most convenient way of making payment since water users only pay for the water they have consumed, this will encourage people to use less water," he said. He also called upon locals to harness rainwater during this rainy season noting that most of the shallow wells might be dry early next year. Weunda's sentiments come as more than 50 homes in Budalang'i were displaced by floods in Mukhunga and Narera areas of Bunyala West. The chief officer praised the project for its four-year presence in the county, noting that their exit in next year in March will be greatly felt. KIWASH Service Capacity Building Provider Specialist Charles Gitahi said the meters will help detect water leaks in the distribution network which will help curtail water consumption. He said the meters will reduce water costs. The project has led to the expansion of Sisenye, Alema and Onana water supplies and infrastructure support for Busia Water and Sewerage Services Company (Buwassco) and Ogallo at Sh13 million, Gitahi said. He added that they also build the capacity of Buwassco staff and management andÂ  20 Wash groups. Edited by R.Wamochie
