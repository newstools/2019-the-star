Western Stima prodigy Benson Ochieng, 17, is targeting  15 goals this season. Speaking after scoring a hat-trick in the team's 4-1 win over Zoo Kericho at Moi Stadium in Kisumu yesterday, Ochieng popularly known as Omalla, said he is now ready for big stage. “I want to sound a warning to fellow strikers that I will give them a run for their money. The competition for the golden boot will be stiff,” said Ochieng. On his recent call up to the national team Harambee Stars, Ochieng said it came as a shock. “I represented Kenya during the Cecafa Under-20. Recently, I was called up to the national team though I didn't expect it,” added the student at Kisumu Day High School. Ochieng has so far scored four goals in five matches. He thanked coach Salim Babu and the Western Stima technical bench for believing in him. “They have given me a chance and I don't want to let the team down,” said Ochieng who is targeting to play in paid ranks in future. Yesterday, coach Salim Babu gave Ochieng his first start of the season. “I'm happy for him. He has scored three times on his full debut. Our striking problems have now been solved. I have been introducing him gradually in the last four games,” said Babu. In the game, Ochieng scored three times with Hamisi Salim adding the fourth from a free kick. Dennis Ongeri pulled one back for Zoo Kericho. Zoo coach Herman Iswekha admitted that he had lost against a better team. “Western Stima got their chances and utilised them. Stima are a very good and strong team. I wish them the best in their matches. We now turn our focus on our game against Ulinzi on December 22,” added the tactician. Babu was happy with the performance of the team. “I'm impressed with the way we played today. The morale of the boys is high and I want them to continue banging in goals,” he said.
