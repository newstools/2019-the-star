Nairobi MCAs have urged city residents to stay clam as they wait for Governor Mike Sonko’s bail ruling on Wednesday morning. Lead by Majority Leader Charles Thuo, the MCAs said operations are going on, despite the arrest of Sonko last Friday. He further assured that the assembly in its capacity will continue to carry its legislative and oversight mandate. “As MCAs we shall execute our role and we also expect the executive to play its role to ensure that there is continuity of services offered to Nairobians,” Thuo said on Tuesday. He further said that the public should remain regardless of the ruling outcome. “Everyone is innocent until proven guilty and we plead with Nairobi people, even those who are supporters of the Governor, not to engage in any demonstrations and to observe peace,” Thuo said.
