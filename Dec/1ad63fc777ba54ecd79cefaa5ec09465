AFC Leopards coach Andre Mbungo has quit the club . The Rwandese coach who joined Ingwe in February has tendered his resignation letter, citing lack of pay for five months. "I had highlighted my plight with the management for quite some time but they seem not to be keen to pay me. I have been patient enough but it's time to quit the club. I wish them best of luck," he said. Leopards have been struggling financially following the exit of SportPesa in August with the players and members of the technical bench going without pay since then. SportPesa stopped sponsoring events after a battle with the government over tax liability. While SportPesa said it was tax compliant, KRA said it had arrears and applied a different method in calculating dues.
