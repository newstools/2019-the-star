Equity Bank women’s team coach David Maina has admitted that injuries scare almost ruined their chances of defending the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) Premier League title. Speaking after his charges defied all the odds to upset star-studded Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) side over the weekend to retain the title, the veteran tactician said it was difficult to use only 12 players and win a championship. “I lost three players including my key performer Kananu (Betty) to injury and I did not have the back up. However, I constantly pushed my girls and urged them to keep going, ” he said. He added: “Despite the injuries scares, I was confident the team would deliver in the end and I was proved right.” A beaming Maina said he will beef up his squad when the new season starts in February by registering 15 players. “We will not register more players. We will go for only the ones we can manage well,” he said adding, “I will add two or three quality players and I have already identified the ones I want.” Equity last Friday retained their crown by beating Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) 61-51 in the play off finals Game Five at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium. Anne Rose Mandela was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) after posting a high 19 points same as Samba Mjomba and Salma Akinyi ‘Garang’. The series started in Mombasa as KPA fell 63-59 in Game One but won Game Two 56-50. The bankers went up 54-51 in Game Three only to lose game Four 69-59.
