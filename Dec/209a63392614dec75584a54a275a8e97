 A Nyamira family is demanding answers over with the death of a relative whose body was found in a thicket near a police station at 8pm on Saturday. Boaz Momanyi, 28, had been seized from his Omogochoro home by police officers from Karlo outpost in Kisii at 11am in connection with the alleged theft of a neighbour's pair of shoes. Yesterday, his sister  Alexinah Kerubo, said more than 10 officers from Karlo arrived at his house at 11am,  roughed him up and took him away. “My brother was in the house when the police came and took him away. They refused to tell us why they had been looking for him. We only found out later that some person had reported that his shoes were missing and that he suspected my brother had taken them," Kerubo said. The body was found at 8pm in a thicket near a coffee farm metres away from the police post. "As a family we want the authorities to take action against those culpable," she said. They want to know why Momanyi was not charged with the offence instead of being clobbered to death. "It is the law that apprehended suspects are charged in a court of law not killed extra-judicially. This is murder most foul," Kerubo said. Kisii county police commander Martin Kibet said the incident was being investigated. He asked the family to file a formal complaint with the police.
