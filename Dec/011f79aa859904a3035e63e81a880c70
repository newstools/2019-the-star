Baldev Singh Chager is the new Kenya National Rally champion following cancellation of this weekend’s KCB Guru Nanak Rally. The event, initially programmed for Sunday, was called off for the second time due to inclement weather. Torrential rains and subsequent flash floods have since made it impossible for organisers Sikh Union Nairobi to run the event due to waterlogged black cotton roads in Stony Athi region. Following the Kenya Motor Sports Federation (KMSF) announcement that the 2019 KNRC will count as a seven rounds championship instead of eight,  Chager becomes the new champion with an unassailable 162 points—20 ahead of second placed  Carl ‘Flash’ Tundo (142). Chager was hoping to finish in the top 10 in Guru Nanak to recapture the coveted title but not until Guru Rally was called off. The KNRC title race went down to the wire after the muddy KCB Eldoret, where Tundo swept the ground with all his opponents to keep his title defence alive. The decision to call off the event was taken by clerk of course Raju Chaggar and communicated to the Kenya Motorsport Federation. “Changes in championships due to such unforeseen circumstances are common in global motorsport and a case in point is the 14th round of the World Rally Champion (WRC) in Australia, which was cancelled at the last minute by the organisers following bush fires in Coffs Harbour last month. “The Australian organisers communicated their decision to the Federatione Il’ Automobile (FIA) who declared the WRC concluded and points earned were tabulated based on 13 instead of 14 rounds to decide the drivers’ and constructors championships. “The KMSF secretariat will compile final KNRC championships’ standings based on seven rounds after considering Article 16.3 of Appendix A of the regulations to declare the championship winners,”  said a statement from KMSF. Other champions are Issa Amwari (Division Two), Ammar Haq (Division One), Daren Miranda (2WD) and Jasmeet Chana (Group N). The 2020 calendar is already published with the first KNRC Championship scheduled February 22-23, 2020.
