The Ministry of Sports wants federations to submit their annual budget by December 31 and has warned that there will be no extension Speaking in  Eldoret during the official opening of the 7th edition of Kenya Universities Sports Association (KUSA) Games, Sports Cabinet Administrative Secretary (CAS) Hassan Noor Hassan said the federations have a few days remaining to submit their budgets for consideration. “The question of federations submitting their budget to the ministry for support should be done on time. We want them to beat the deadline of December 31,” said Noor. He said the strict timeline was meant to avoid last-minute rush and rationalise support in terms of the funding of sports. “The funds are limited in various operations. It is not an open cheque where people walk in and out freely. It is not that the funds can support all federations and teams but we have to stick to the budget,” explained Noor. “Early submission of budgets is a better way of managing resources,” he added. The CAS also waded into the doping menace and backed Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Amina Mohamed proposal to criminalise the act in the country. “The challenge we have in the sports sector today is doping which we want criminalised. Starting from the athletes to the coaches and their management,” Noor observed. He also urged KUSA to apply for funds from the ministry since they also help in nurturing talent. “We have to support and nurture talent at universities level through sports academies,” he added. In the games, United States International University (USIU-Africa) started their men’s hockey title defence on a high note following their 2-1 win over Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology(JKUAT) at Moi University Annex campus. In women soccer, USIU-A were thrashed 3-0 by Kenyatta University. Host Moi University meanwhile played out to a barren draw against JKUAT in men’s soccer.
