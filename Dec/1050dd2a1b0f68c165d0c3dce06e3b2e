I agree with sentiments expressed by some Kenyans that it is a conflict of interest to have sitting senators, or any other legislator representing a government official, especially a state official accused of a crime as counsel. Because of the principle of separation of powers, the legislative arm of government must not be seen to participate in a judicial process as counsel, as witnesses is allowed, but it's high time we revisited the laws that allow this to happen to allow justice to take its course.
