Two men have drowned in Naivasha as the rains continue to pound the country. One died in a river and the other in a dam. The disaster management committee in the area has issued a flooding alert. In the first incident, a swimming mission by a group of youths on the flooded River Malewa ended tragically after one of them was swept away by waters. Witness Jane Wambui said the youths were swimming near Olmagogo area. She said the water levels in the river that flows into Lake Naivasha has in the last two weeks risen sharply. “The youths were swimming from one end to the other and in the process one of them was swept away. His body is yet to be recovered,” Wambui said. She said efforts to rescue the youth were unsuccessful In the second incident, a 29-year-old man died after allegedly jumping into a flooded dam in Mununga village. The man is said to have quarrelled with his mother after she barred him from selling one of the cattle. An elder in the village, James Mwaniki, said the victim first engaged the mother in a heated argument before rushing to the flooded dam. “Information coming from the mother is that the victim got angry after he was barred from selling the family’s only cow,” he said. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru confirmed both incidents. He said one body had been recovered while the search for the second one is going on. “One body has been retrieved from the dam but we are still searching for the one who drwoned in River Malewa,” he said.
