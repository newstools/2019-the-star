The recovery of decomposed bodies at the Likoni crossing channel is increasingly becoming a frequent phenomenon. This is worrying to ferry users. The mother and daughter who slipped from the MV Harambee in September were not found until two weeks later. Two weeks ago, a man walked into the deep ocean from the same jinxed vessel. The state should move with speed to avert the constant deaths at the channel or risk losing more lives to the ocean believed by locals to be infested with ‘dark powers’ pulling people in for their blood. The Likoni vessels are increasingly becoming a bad omen and threat of bad news whenever the channel is mentioned. We should also pray for the channel in case the ‘dark powers’ indeed exist under the ocean.  Mombasa
