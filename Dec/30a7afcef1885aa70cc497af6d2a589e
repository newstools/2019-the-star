Kenya Red Cross held 2019 volunteer awards at The Boma Hotel, Nairobi, on Friday. The event was meant to recognise and appreciate efforts made by individuals, government and non-governmental institutions as well as corporates to alleviate human suffering. "Currently, we are witnessing flooding, which continues to cause distress to many of our citizens across the country and the Kenya Red Cross volunteers have selflessly responded to rescue families,"  Kenya Red Cross chairman Amin Sheikh said. "We are committed to ensuring that we continue to improve the conditions of our volunteers' work as well as celebrating them."
