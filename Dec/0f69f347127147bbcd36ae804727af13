Chiefs who don’t cooperate in disarmament exercises risk being sacked, says Turkana county commissioner Wambua Muthama. Muthama said since the disarmament started, they have only collected 190 firearms from the hands of civilians, who voluntarily surrendered them. Muthama spoke on Thursday during the Jamhuri day celebrations at Moi Garden ground in Lodwar Turkana county. In July, Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya announced a major disarmament operation against bandits the North Rift region but the date was not disclosed. He warned chiefs who will not support the move will be sacked. He said the exercise is still ongoing and those still in possession of illegal firearms should voluntarily surrender before the start of the planned forced disarmament. “When I reached chiefs of Turkana East on the issue of illegal firearms in the region possessed by residents, they admitted they have more than ten guns in the region. When I called them back to help government get those illegal firearms, they denied possession of illegal firearms in their villages,” he said. Muthama said recently six people were arrested in Turkana East with AK47 rifles. Three will taken to court and charged with possession of firearms without a licence while three other will be charged with mingling with those possessing illegal firearms. “I have ordered the Deputy County Commissioner of Turkana East to write a letter to chief of Turkana East to explain why they said there are no illegal firearms in their regions and at first they had admitted,” he said.
