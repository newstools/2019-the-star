The alumni of both Starehe Boys and Starehe Girls centres hosted a fundraising dinner at the Movenpick Hotel on November 29 to cater for fees for form 1s who will be joining the schools next year. All the proceeds went towards supporting the Starehe Schools’ endowment fund — the Griffin Memorial Endowment Trust. The dinner was hosted by the school director Josphat Mwaura and the Old Starehian Society chairman Raymond Rayno. Also honoured were the widow of the late Kibra MP Ken Okoth, whose brother Imran Okoth attended the event. The chief guest was former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga.
