Kwale leaders have requested the government to appoint a local to fill the late Fatuma Tabwara's position at the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC). This request comes a day after Fatuma was buried at Kombani in Matuga Sub-county. She succumbed to a heart attack on Sunday morning at a family member's wedding within the county. Speaking on Monday at her burial, Matuga MP Kassim Tandaza said Kwale had no other commissioner than the late Tabwara. He said Tabwara died with a clean record as NCIC vice-chairperson and appointing a new person within the jurisdiction she operated would be a better way of remembering and appeasing her. “It is through God’s will that she is no longer with us and having died while in the line of duty with no scandals, I think it would be fair enough for the government to return the favor by choosing someone else within her homeland,” he said. Isiolo Deputy Governor Dr Abdi Issa, however, wants President Kenyatta to appoint a woman for the NCIC vice-chairperson position. Issa said Tabwara was courageous and would prefer other Kwale women to be given equal chances to carry her legacy. National Land Commissioner Kazungu Kambi, who was also present, told Kwale communities to shun away from the habit of complaining.
