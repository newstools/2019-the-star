Following the cancellation of Day 3 schedule on Saturday due to inclement weather, Austrian driver Kris Rosenberger assumed the lead on Day Four of the East African Safari Classic Rally in Tanzania. Driving a Porsche 911, Kris had his campaign effectively sewn up when initial leader Onkar Rai ran into mechanical gremlins on CS 12, the last for the day before cars pulled into Tanga for the overnight rest. Onkar now sits fifth on the leaderboard with his brother, Tejveer Rai the top Kenyan in third behind Stig Blomqvist of Sweden. Kris has lost a total of 6.53.57.0. Blomqvist, who is 30 seconds adrift is seeking to clinch his second career title. Onkar has a steady run though, and at an average speed of 107kph, the Kabras man won the second section of the day, which was long 91km CS11 at Same. In this stage, Onkar eclipsed Ford Escort's Oman driver Osian Pryc by a mere 0.38.9 seconds. It was another bad day in the office for Baldev Chager, who again missed two stages. Chager, who dictated the pace on Day One had to contend with torsion bar problems. Earlier on CS 10, which was the day's first stage, former world champion Blomqvist produced a superb piece of driving to set the fastest time. The Swede is being navigated by his compatriot Jorgen Fornander in a Porsche 911. Meanwhile, torrential rains have made the going in this edition of the Safari Classic a nightmare.
