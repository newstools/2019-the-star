Kenya was forced to settle for fourth place at the Copa Africa Cup following a 2-1 loss to Zambia in the third-place playoff. Zambia's tormentor-in-chief, Kuse Sifuwe scored a brace for the visitors while Kenya's talisman Elisha Joel scored a consolation goal. Sifuwe scored in the third and ninth minutes with Elisha's goal coming in between from the penalty spot. Kenya has hosted all the two editions of the Pan African tournament. Meanwhile, hat trick hero and golden boot winner Paul Nyerere helped Tanzania win the title with a 6-2 drubbing of Zimbabwe. After falling to Inasio Perezzo's fourth-minute goal, the Tanzanians oozed class with Nyerere crucial to the side. He levelled matters five minutes later with a sublime finish. The pacy forward made it 2-1 in the 15th minute before Ndile Hurun and Rai Mohamed added a goal each. Nyerere completed his hat trick in the 28th minute as Tanzania led 5-1 heading into the breather. Boniface Raphael wrapped up the win with Ronald Uziyaya getting Zimbabwe's second. Nyerere scored seven goals in the tournament. And as the curtains came down on the four-day championship at the Mpesa Academy, Thika as Zambia's shot-stopper Mwamba Mathews won the golden glove.  Luke Musikiri of Zimbabwe was crowned the Most Valuable Player. “We exited this competition in quarterfinals last year and we have gone all the way this year. I want to laud my charges for the excellent display throughout the tournament. I am excited about the future of these lads. They will be a great asset to Tanzanian football,” said Tanzania coach Abel Mutweve.
