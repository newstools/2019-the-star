Diageo global Scotch brand ambassador Tom Jones has urged Kenyans to moderate their drinking this festive season. "We are not advocating that. We won't recommend anyone ever to drink to get drunk," he told Word Is recently. "You don't want to lose control but to enjoy your night with good company, with your friends, and to enjoy good quality drinks." Jones has worked in the world of spirits for 17 years. He was in Kenya to launch the new range of Singleton Single Malt Whiskies, aimed at new whisky drinkers. In addition to the 12-year-old range launched a few years ago, the new range of Singleton Malt Whisky comes in two variants, 15-year-old and 18-year-old. "We sold the 12 and it's Kenya's best sold single malt. Because it's been so successful, we decided to bring on the 15- and 18-year-old as well. You can enjoy it with anything. Anyone can enjoy it," Jones said. “Nothing gives me more joy than helping people discover more about our history and heritage." He has previously held senior management positions in the hospitality industry, worked for Diageo since 2003 and travels the world hosting events to share his unrivalled knowledge of whiskies.
