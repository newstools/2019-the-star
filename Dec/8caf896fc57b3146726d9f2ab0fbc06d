Kiss 100 presenter Andrew Kibe has brought different personalities together through an auction to help create decent toilets for pupils at Lang’ata West Primary School, where his son studies. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, he said he got the auction idea after visiting his son’s school and finding the toilets in a bad condition. “I decided to do something but I didn’t have the ability to do it at the time. So I waited for like two years and now I can make things happen,” he said. “I brought together celebrities to give me their items to sort out my son’s school. We are auctioning the items to people who need them and we can use the money to sort out the toilets. There are 225 toilets in this county.” The event will take place at the Blu Bistro, Nextgen Mall, today evening. “The problem is always starting. It has taken me two years to do this. A week ago, we decided to just do it because we have been procrastinating for too long,” he said. “We shall have an hour of auctioning at Blu Bistro and on all social media platforms. I was also overwhelmed by Quick Mart for supplying a whole year of tissue paper to the school.” This is Kibe’s way of giving back to the community. “When you go to a toilet and find it dirty, you leave there feeling worse because you have not been treated with dignity. These kids need to be treated with dignity. They should go to a toilet that has lighting, tissue paper, soap and water.” Celebrities and media personalities who have contributed to this project include Radio Africa CEO Patrick Quarcoo, Kiss presenter Kamene Goro, comedians Jalang’o and Dr Ofweneke, Churchill, Classic 105’s Maina Kageni, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, Xtian Dela, Njugush, Collins Injera, J Blessing, Mithelle Ntalami, DJ Dii, Pascal Tokodi and Shaq.
