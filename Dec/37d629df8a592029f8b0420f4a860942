The Office of the Director of Public Prosecution will from Monday set up a Prosecution Fund to collect money recovered from corruption deals. DPP Noordin Haji on Friday said the proceeds from corruption will then be restituted and be run by people of integrity who will ensure the money is returned to the government. Haji spoke at Old Moses Camp at the base of Mt Kenya where he met a group of 30 human rights activists who had scaled the mountain to raise awareness on rights violations. “We need Kenyans to see how corruption proceeds are restituted and taken back to where they were looted from,” the DPP said. He added that some of the recovered money will be used to fund human rights awareness efforts across the country. Haji expressed regrets that corruption is hindering the country’s realisation of the Bill of Rights in the Constitution adding that in the endeavour to fight the vice, the government would also ensure human rights are secured and protected. Amnesty International Kenya Director Houghton Irungu lauded the mountaineering team saying their hike to Point Lenana would inspire a third revolution in the country that would end corruption, impunity and other forms of injustices. The climb, which is part of this year’s celebrations to mark International Human Rights Day, was also meant to raise funds to put up a Human Rights Centre in Nairobi that will house victims of rights violations as well as offer legal aid. Coalition for Human Rights Defenders Executive Director Kamau Ngugi said they had so far raised Sh3.6 million towards the cause and hoped that with scaling the second highest mountain in Africa, more donations would be forthcoming. He further added that the scaling of the mountain comes amidst a backdrop of challenges by human rights defenders that range from occupational risks to persecution with little or no protection from government agencies in their fight for freedom of expression.
