Wundanyi MP Danson Mwashako has called for the revision of the Building Bridges Initiative report to factor in proposals from the youth. He said the report did not highlight any clear way of empowering the young generation, noting that the BBI team left out important recommendations. "The report only talks of tax waiver for the youth but it lacks clear recommendations of empowering them to start businesses. If we're going to support the report, there must be some revisions," the legislator said. Speaking in Challa, Taveta subcounty, Mwashako, however, said if implemented, the report will help compensate the unattended promises by the Jubilee regime. "Let us utilise this opportunity given to us by the principals. As the leadership of Taita Taveta county, we need to relook at the employment issues the Jubilee promised to deliver. It is time we use the report to restore the trust in our youth by creating jobs for them," he added. Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja promised to rally other county leaders to support the report. He said the report will rescue the county constituencies from being scrapped-off for failing to meet the threshold required as per the latest census results. “We fully support the BBI since it has shielded our constituencies from either being merged or being scrapped-off. “Before the end of February next year I will organise for a mega rally where the public will be given an opportunity to air their views on the report,” he said. Senator Jones Mwaruma termed the BBI as a solution to the high unemployment rate among youths in the country. Mwaruma said the increasing number of unemployed youth was negatively affecting the economic growth of the country.
