Police in Mombasa are investigating the mysterious death of a Kenya Defense Forces soldier whose body was found in a house in Mtongwe, Likoni. According to the police reports, Abraham Kipchirchir–a naval soldier at Mtongwe Navy base–was found dead in his rental house after he failed to report to work for three days. Kipchirchir was among the multi-agency divers' team that was involved in the search of Mariam Kighenda, 35, and her four-year-old daughter Amanda Mutheu after their car plunged into the Indian Ocean. The Toyota Isis reversed and slid off the MV Harambee ferry which midstream in October. Likoni OCPD Jane Munywoki said Kipchirchir's phone went unanswered since Saturday. When colleagues visited him on Monday at about 1600 hours, Munywoki said, they found his house locked from inside and there was still no response when they knocked on the door. "But a foul stench was emanating from inside the house." “We cannot rule on the cause of his death pending an autopsy, but we have established that the deceased had a medical history and had sought treatment at the Navy dispensary. He was under medication for an ailment yet to be established,” Munywoki said. She said the body was found on his bed after police broke into the house. "It did not have any physical injuries." The body is lying at the Jocham Mortuary awaiting an autopsy. In 2017, senior sergeant Charles Omondi, 43, was found dead by a neighbour in his house at the Mtongwe navy base in Mombasa. Omondi was found on his bed with a Bible and two phones beside him. Edited by R.Wamochie
