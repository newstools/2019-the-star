Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has urged the new National Cohesion and Integration Commission to do as good a job as their predecessors. Matiang'i met the team, being led by NCIC chairperson Samuel Kobia, at his Harambee House office on Wednesday. He said former chairman Francis ole Kaparo and his team had done great work in buildinga good culture. Matiang'i asked Kenyans to exercise a culture of tolerance and diversity. "We are never going to agree all the time. Our opinions are always going to be different but we should learn to welcome all debates and express our diversity. It is no excuse to insult one another in order to spark problems," Matiang'i said. He said the team will get full support from the government and wished them well as they start their job. Kobia urged politicians, religious leaders, civil society organisations and the media to avoid inciting and insulting others. Inspector General Hillary Mutyambai said the National Police Service is ready to work with NCIC to manage security in the country. Other commissioners are Fatuma Tabwara, Dorcas Kadogo, Samuel Ekona, Philip Okundi and Danvas Makori. The team picked Fatuma as its vice chairperson. Kobia's team is the third set of commissioners taking over from the team that was previously led by Kaparo, which exited office in August. It will serve for a term of six years. President Uhuru Kenyatta on October 22 nominated Kobia as the chairperson.
