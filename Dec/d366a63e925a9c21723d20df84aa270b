After clinching the male player of the year award during the Magharibi Michezo Awards gala, Greensharks attacker Chris Wokila has set his target on winning the Premier League title. Wokila was the top scorer in the just-concluded season with 13 strikes to narrowly beat his closest challengers, Festus Onyango of Strathmore (12) and Amos Barkibir of Butali (11). He observed that the team is prepared to break the recent dominance by Butali and Police, adding that consistency will be key. The self-sponsored outfit's best performance came seven seasons ago when they finished second. "It was a good year on the individual level but not for the team, after finishing fourth. We have everything to play for next season and the current crop of players can dream of the gong, but only if we push ourselves to the limit. We have had results against the big clubs and if we can march them, then we can lay our hands on the trophy," said the former Kakamega High School player. "Our main undoing has been a poor second leg and surprise loses against inferior opposition. We hope to address these shortcomings in the new season." Wokila opined that few quality additions will not only make the team a force to be reckoned with, but also make the exciting project stable in the wake of injuries. "The desire of every team is to have depth and few new faces will be a major boost for us. We need a mixture of experience and talent to be an outstanding team." He also harbours a dream of playing abroad but only if he accomplishes his objectives with the Victor Osiche-captained Sharks.
