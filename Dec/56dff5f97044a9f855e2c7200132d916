An advocate has filed a case seeking to stop a foreign company from trading or dealing with the Kilimanjaro bhang seeds. The Kilimanjaro cannabis sativa has been categorized as a variety of medium medicinal value but with very high economic potential due to its resilience, potency, consistency in genetic structure and cross breeding qualities. John Ochola says between February and August, he physically confirmed the actual growing areas within the Amboseli biosphere reserve during his visits to several localities on both sides of the Kenya-Tanzania border. Through lawyer George Lwande, Ochola says Hemp Passion SL has unlawfully accessed, extracted and carted away and further continues to illegally exploit, market and sell the genetic resources identified as Kilimanjaro Sativa. He says the marijuana which is derived from Kajiado county is being exploited without prior consent from the local communities, access permits or licenses from relevant regulatory agencies and without any compensation to the local communities. “Hemp's action is a continuing illegality and violates my rights and other citizens' constitutional rights,” says Ochola. He is seeking an order restraining Hemp from further marketing, advertising selling, trading or dealing with Kilimanjaro sativa cannabis seeds or any of its derivatives. He also wants court to declare that cultivation of cannabis for industrial or medicinal use is not subject to prohibition. Also sought is an order to compel the Ministry of Health to make comprehensive regulations on medicinal cannabis cultivation, production, extraction, importation, exportation and supply within the country. Hemp is a foreign cannabis seed company with a core business of developing, marketing and selling strains from genetics from all over the world. Its business practice is to obtain pure landrace plants from traditional producing areas and commercialise them.
