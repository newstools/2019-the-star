 In a dramatic fightback, German rookie Esther Henseleit smashed the course record at the Par 72 PGA Vipingo Ridge to chalk up her maiden title with victory in the Ladies European Tour’s Magical Kenya Ladies Open. The German did not just win the LET Order of Merit for 2019 but was declared the Rookie of the season on tour. The 20 year old had her campaign effectively sewn up when Swedish rookie Julia Engstrom stumbled on the dramatic last day with a disappointing round of 2 over which dipped her to third with 11 under par 277. Julia led the tournament for three days and went into the last round with a seven storke advantage. But this turned out to be a nightmare when she dropped three shots on both nines. With a scintillating round of 8 under par 64 yesterday, Henseleit savored her surprise course record and an impressive gross total of 14 under par 274. Indian Adit Ashok settled for second place on 13 under par 275 gross. Henseleit started the last round with a 7 shot deficit but surprised all and sundry with her stunning comeback which made all the difference. Henseleit: “It’s quite a good feeling when you stage a fightback with a huge deficit and come back victorious. I am chuffed to clinch the rookie of the year award and the order of merit. I just tried to play many birdies and hit many good irons so this worked out really well. The course is beautiful. I mean it played abut easier today as the greens were softer and yes, I did the best I could.” On the penultimate round, Henseleit walked off the course somewhat furious with her round of 1 under, but dramatically pulled through yesterday contrary to all expectations. “Yesterday after my round I was a bit disappointed I would say, but I just tried to do everything I could. I definitely tried to attack even though I knew it would be difficult to do so.” Henseleit added. In becoming the inaugural winner the Kenyan round, Henseleit bagged a prize money of 45,000 Euros (Ksh. 5million). First Lady Margaret Kenyatta who graced the occasion alongside Sports Minister Amina Mohammed and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho said: “I’m excited to join all and sundry on this auspicious occasion. Kenya is deeply honored to host a round of the Ladies European Tour and I congratulate the winners and every single player who participated in the historic event. This publicity from the tournament has helped position Kenya as a destination of choice as we head into the festive season.”  FINAL RESULTS AFTER 4 ROUNDS 1 Esther Henseleit (GER) (-14 ) 274 2 Aditi Ashok (IND) ( -1) 275 3 Julia Engstrom (SWE) ( -11) 277 4 Cheyenne Woods (USA) ( -6 282 5 Astrid Vayson De Pradenne (FRA) ( -5) 283 6 Christine Wolf (AUT)  (-4) 284 7 Laura Fuenfstueck (GER) (-3) 285 7 Gemma Dryburgh (SCO) ( -3) 285 9 Beth Allen (USA) 6,900.00 (-1) 287 9 Olivia Cowan (GER) 6,900.00 (-1) 287 9 Manon De Roey (BEL) 6,900.00 (-1) 287  1 Esther Henseleit (GER) GER 45,000.00 -14 274 69 70 71 64 2 Aditi Ashok (IND) IND 27,000.00 -13 275 73 70 67 65 3 Julia Engstrom (SWE) SWE 18,000.00 -11 277 67 66 70 74 4 Cheyenne Woods (USA) USA 13,500.00 -6 282 70 70 74 68 5 Astrid Vayson De Pradenne (FRA) FRA 10,800.00 -5 283 69 74 67 73 6 Christine Wolf (AUT) AUT 9,300.00 -4 284 73 71 66 74 7 Laura Fuenfstueck (GER) GER 7,950.00 -3 285 78 68 69 70 7 Gemma Dryburgh (SCO) SCO 7,950.00 -3 285 74 73 68 70 9 Beth Allen (USA) USA 6,900.00 -1 287 73 72 75 67 9 Olivia Cowan (GER) GER 6,900.00 -1 287 79 70 68 70 9 Manon De Roey (BEL) BEL 6,900.00 -1 287 72 73 71 71
