Residents of Buladima village in Isiolo have decried the increase in insecurity in the area. They called for the reintroduction of National Police Reservists to improve security. This comes after armed bandits sprayed bullets on one of the area elder’s gate on Sunday night, sparking fear among residents. Osman Dima, an area elder whose homestead was invaded, accused the police of poor response. He claimed that security officers only made their way to the scene of crime more than 10 hours after they were notified. He further stated that criminal activities were on the increase in the area following the government’s move to withdraw National Police Reservists, leaving the community members at the mercy of attackers. Residents are now calling for reintroduction of reservist firearms in the area, arguing that police have failed to assure community members of their protection. Isiolo North MP Hassan Odha said that it was unacceptable for security officers to respond to a crime incident after ten hours later, noting that Buladima village is only three kilometers from Isiolo police station. He accused the police of laxity, calling upon Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i to consider reintroducing NPR guns in the area to enable the locals to protect themselves against such attacks. Odha argued that such incidents were unheard of when the local community had two NPR guns, adding that the withdrawal of the said guns was ill advised as it only exposed the local community to attacks.
