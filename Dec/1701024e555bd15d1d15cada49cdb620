Embu's coffee is among the best quality coffee in the world, Governor Martin Wambora has said. He said the produce should fetch high prices in the external markets. "Coffee farmers should be rich farmers, best quality should translate to best earnings," he said. Speaking at the Embu Coffee Mill, Wambora saidmarketers in the United States of America had endorsed the Embu product. "It was such pleasant surprise to find coffee from Embu selling at $4 (Sh400) per cup in North Carolina", said Wambora. The county boss was addressing leaders of various coffee factories that have signed a milling contract with the newly established Embu Coffee Mill. He said the county government through the ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives and other stakeholders will seek more markets for the product. "We will extensively market our coffee in Botswana, Saudi Arabia, Colorado and other best coffee markets," he said.
