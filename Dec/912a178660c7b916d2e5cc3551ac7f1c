Kenya has been without a vibrant opposition since last year's March 9 handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. Since then, Kenya has witnessed a pocket of opposition from other leaders including ANC's Musalia Mudavadi, Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula, trade unionist Francis Atwoli, but it has fizzled out. Now, the Tangatanga group has assumed the 'official opposition' role. The gusto with which the MPs allied to it are taking the handshake government is admirable. The group is providing checks and balances to the executive in a mighty way. However, their try to criticise the Jubilee government is failing because they lack control of instruments of power. If they are to execute their opposition role effectively, the pro-DP Ruto camp should transform into a political party in readiness for 2022.  Nairobi
