Dani Alves wants to move to the Premier League in the summer. Paris Saint-Germain are getting increasingly frustrated with the Brazilian as they wait to find out whether he will accept the one-year contract extension they have offered him. And Brazilian outlet UOL is now reporting that he is holding out for a two-year deal. Alves is also waiting to see if a Premier League team express an interest in him before signing the contract. Part of the appeal of moving to the English top flight is the fact that teams from the country tend to provide more stability. The 36-year-old is thought to have been disappointed by a lack of options in the PSG squad this season. That meant he had to feature in a number of positions, and he would want the French giants to explain how they would move forward if he was to stay. Alves previously attracted interest from the likes of Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United before he signed for PSG in 2017. He even told Pep Guardiola that he would move to the Etihad Stadium before deciding to join PSG. There is no suggestion that any of those clubs are currently interested in signing him up.
