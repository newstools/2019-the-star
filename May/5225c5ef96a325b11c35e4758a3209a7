Before his appointment as IPOA chairman, he served as aÂ  non-executive director of Guaranty Trust Bank (Kenya) Ltd and Fina Bank Ltd until December 23, 2013. Macharia holds a Bachelors degree in law from the University of Nairobi and a diploma from the Kenya School of Law. He is currently the managing partner at Macharia-Mwangi & Njeru Advocates.
