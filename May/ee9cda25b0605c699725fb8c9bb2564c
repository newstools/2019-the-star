President Uhuru Kenyatta has extended KDF chief Samson Mwathetheâ€™s term for one more year effective May 6. Key sources in KDF and State House said the extension is meant to allow Inspector General Hillary Mutyambai settle in the National Security Council before the Chief Defense Forces exits. Mwathethe replaced Julius Karangi from Kenya Air Force. The KDF Act gives the President powers to extend the term of office of military chiefs for a period not exceeding one year. Mwathethe is a naval officer appointed on April 17, 2015.
