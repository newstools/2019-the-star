Big Pin is back with a love song, 'Juu', featuring Mayonde. He said he is always in a good space to work on love songs because he is big on love. That is why most of his songs are love songs, including his new one. "Every time I write a love song, I am usually in that space. When I wrote the song with Mayonde, I was in that space, but things have changed since," Big Pin told Adelle and Shaffie on Kiss. The one challenge he faced was he didnâ€™t know who he would collaborate with for this song, and after he met Mayonde, he knew she was the perfect one. He is also working on a new album, although he has a lot of songs that are collaborations. This time he has decided to work on an album because it is more of a catalogue for him as an artiste.
