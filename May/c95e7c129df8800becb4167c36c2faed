In a circular dated May 23, Chepkawai said students will only be allowed to participate in co-curricular activities as per the laid down programme. “Any principal, who hosts meetings without express written authorization from the education office, will be held accountable for any eventualities reported,” added Chepkawai. In Siaya, the tournament was to kick off on June 2 at St Mary’s School, Yala while in Nyanza South, Homa Bay School, Nduru Boys and Agoro Sare are in the process of planning their tournament.
