The Bible puts it clearly, “Those who spare the rod of discipline hate their children. Those who love their children care enough to discipline them.” I think parents have skipped a page on the parenting manual. The rate at which youths are drowning in frustrations, drug abuse, homicide and suicide is alarming. This be the generation that was pampered; receiving everything they wanted at the snap of a finger. Such a generation whose buttocks have never been touched by the rod of correction. They have never been told ‘No’ by their overprotective parents who treat them as friends. When such a child is told ‘No’ for the first time, they act out. Corporal punishment must be returned to our schools and homes to snap the youth back to sanity.
