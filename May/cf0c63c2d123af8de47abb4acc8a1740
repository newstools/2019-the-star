In an interview with a local radio station, the 57-year-old said he was unapologetic for calling for the decriminalization of same-sex relationships in Kenya and other parts of the world. “I am obviously going to be advancing an agenda that says there should be at least the decriminalization of same sexual activity. It is straight forward, I am not gonna mess around with that one. That is obviously my belief,” he said. Last week, Kenya's High Court declined to repeal sections of the Penal Code that criminalize gay sex. The photo ignited mixed reactions with many congratulating him.
