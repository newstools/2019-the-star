Detectives have launched a manhunt for thugs who broke into Bungoma Central OCPD's house on Tuesday night and stole his pistol. The unknown number of thugs made a daring robbery after they walked into the house of Chwele OCPD David Kandie while he was asleep. It was not clear how the thieves gained entry into the officer's house. The incident happened at about 5am at Chwele B village about 200 metres from the police station. Kandie reported that at about 3.30am after morning call up, he returned to bed. He said he was woken up by one of his children that he had left the door wide open. He found the house ransacked and some of his items missing including a pistol with 15 rounds of ammunition, phones and cash. Bungoma police county commander Francis Sang visited the scene of crime. He said no arrest had been made and the police operation was continuing. Sang said police were working with Nyumba Kumi officials in Chwele to recover the gun. He asked members of the community with any information that could lead to arrests to share with police.
