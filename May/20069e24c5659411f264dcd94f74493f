The tarmacking of the 172km Kibwezi-Kitui-Migwani road by Chinese firm Synohydro is facing headwinds in two lawsuits. Kitui acting county commissioner Jackson ole Chuta on Wednesday said a university don and a businessman whose storey building and petrol station, respectively, are allegedly on the road reserve have sued to stop their demolition. The building is in Chuluni and the petrol station is at Wikililye market. Chuta spoke in Kitui town after leading a team of county projects delivery and implementation committee, a team from State house and Kenha officials in an inspection tour of the Sh18 billion road project from Chuluni to Kitui town. He said many people who had erected buildings on the road reserve voluntarily removed them after being given a notice by Kenha. Kenha engineer Fredrick Ndutu confirmed the one-month notice for the removal of any structures on the road reserve and blocking the construction of the class A 9  national road expired on Wednesday. “Upon the lapsing on the notice, the government has no option but to move in and bring down all the buildings erected on the road reserve,” Ndutu said. He said save for that “small court suit hiccup”, work is progressing at a good pace and it is expected to be completed on schedule. Chuta said families had initially opposed the road passing through the place they have buried relatives. “We resolved the issue and the affected families will be assisted in having their departed relatives buried elsewhere away from the road reserve,” he said. At least 38 bodies will be exhumed between Chuluni market and Kitui town to allow the road to pass. Chuta said court orders had been acquired to facilitate the exhumation.
