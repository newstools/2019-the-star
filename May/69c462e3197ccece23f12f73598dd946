Celtic have launched a sensational move to lure Jose Mourinho as their new manager. The Scottish champions have made an offer to Mourinho, who is mulling over his next move after the sack at Manchester United last December. The 56-year-old is likely to field a number of approaches over the coming weeks, with Lyon also interested in securing his services. Roma are the latest club to be linked. The salary on the table at Celtic Park is believed to be competitive, although Mourinho is unlikely to be rushed into a decision. A move north of the border would represent an opportunity to strengthen his trophy haul, with Celtic gunning to become the first team ever to lift 10 consecutive league titles. Saturday’s 3-0 victory at Aberdeen confirmed their eight Scottish Premiership crown on the bounce. Neil Lennon has steadied the ship after Brendan Rodgers left Glasgow for Leicester City earlier than anticipated. Lennon has a strong number of admirers to reclaim the job permanently. Part of Mourinho’s decision-making process will be down to whether he believes Celtic can make meaningful strides in the Champions League after falling behind the continent’s elite. They were dumped out by AEK Athens in the qualifiers this season and then only made the last 32 of the Europa League before defeat at the hands of Valencia. Mourinho has made it clear that he would like to continue working in England but was left chastened by the way in which his time at Old Trafford ended. Celtic insist that they have not made a concrete offer to Mourinho.
