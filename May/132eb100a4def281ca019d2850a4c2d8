American superstar J Boog is coming to Kenya next month for the 'Tomorrow's Leaders Festival', a charity event of the Morgan Heritage Foundation to support youth leadership in Africa. J Boog is known with his famous song 'Let's do it again', which he released in 2013 after working with Gramp Morgan (of the group Morgan Heritage). The Tomorrowâ€™s Leaders Festival will go down at Kasarani Stadium on June 8. It will feature a formidable line-up of some of the finest African and Jamaican music and entertainment giants, such as Alaine, Jereme Morgan, Diamond Platnumz and Wyre. Proceeds of #TLF2019 will go into supporting youth initiatives, including innovation in education, agriculture, health, gender equality, leadership programs, vocational education programmes, citizenship and advocacy programmes.
