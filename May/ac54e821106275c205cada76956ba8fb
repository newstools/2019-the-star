According to the unclaimed financial asset Act, such assets include bank savings and deposits, cheques and drafts, money orders and funds held or owing under any life or endowment insurance policy or annuity contract.

Out of these, claims amounting to 166.9 million and 908,107 units of shares have been paid to 2,125 claimants. While it is not clear who owns the unclaimed assets, a spot check into the authorities online register shows that top government officials led by President Uhuru Kenyatta are some of the people besides ordinary Citizens yet to make a claim. The register shows that assets unclaimed by Kenyatta were forwarded to the authority by the National Bank of Kenya. Others are ex-vice president Kalonzo Musyoka whose assets were forwarded by Kenya Commercial Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Cooperative Bank of Kenya and Safaricom. Also forwarded by Safaricom are assets of unknown value belonging to the late businessman and government minister Nicholas Biwott. Former Cabinet minister Maina Wanjigi also has some assets to his name forwarded by Williamson Tea and Barclays Bank of Kenya. African Union Special Envoy for Infrastructure Raila Odinga also has some assets to his name through the Raila Odinga Centre. Seven years after his death, assets connected to the late defence minister Njenga Karume and forwarded by Safaricom, KCB Group and Standard Charterd. Karume was widely known for his businesses in the hotel industry and the real estate sector. Even as the rich and ordinary Kenyans shy away from claiming the billions of shillings, the agency remains to be the custodian of the assets until itâ€™s reunited with the rightful owners.
