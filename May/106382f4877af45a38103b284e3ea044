World 5000m champion Helen Obiri leads a quality field in the 3000m ahead of next month's Prefontaine Classic in Stanford, USA. Obiri, who is also the world cross country champion, is coming off a victory at the Doha Diamond League meeting early this month, where she posted 8:25.60. Obiri has a good record at the Prefontaine Classic where she set meet records at 1,500m in 2013 and 2014, then won the 5,000m in 2016. Obiri will have World U20 cross-country champion Beatrice Chebet and 2017 world cross-country bronze medallist, Lilian Kasait Rengeruk for company The Kenyan quartet faces a strong field in the seven-lap race which will be graced by world and Olympic champion 800-metres champion Caster Semenya. Although she has contested the distance in low-key domestic races in South Africa, this will be her first international 3000m race. Olympic 10,000m champion and world record-holder Almaz Ayana will be competing in the US for the first time.
