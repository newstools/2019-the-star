The High Court in Kiambu has approved Governor Ferdinand  Waititu’s application for anticipatory bail. Principal Margistrate B Khaemba said on Thursday that the affidavit presented to the court by Waititu’s lawyer Ashiolya Biko met all the requirements for anticipatory bail. Waititu was granted Sh500,000 anticipatory bail. This means that he cannot be locked up and instead shall be escorted to the nearby police station by his counsel where he will be informed of what led to his arrest. The order is to be served to DCI George Kinoti, IG Hilary Mutyambai and DPP Noordin Haji. The court said an interpartes hearing will be on May 30. The court has warned served respondents from ignoring court orders, saying that it will be considered as contempt of court, which is liable to fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both. The governor was arrested by the EACC detectives on Thursday after they raided his homes in search of documents linking him to an  irregular tender award of Sh.588 million.
