More than half of residents in Nairobi prioritize security and lack of violence to money when switching cities. A new research by a global consulting leader in advancing health, wealth and career, Mercer shows that 67 per cent of workers in the city rank security, safety, and lack of violence as the top reasons to stay in or leave their city. Commenting on the role of artificial intelligence in securing economic opportunities and growth, Mercer strategy and geographic expansion leader Pearly Siffel said stakeholders need to rethink the workforce of the future and building a more suitable business environment. "Technology is important but putting people first will better enable organizations to succeed," Siffel said. According to Siffel, factors such as career and work opportunities, work satisfaction and pays and bonuses attract and keep people in new cities. However, businesses must also tailor their solutions, approaches and communications to the individual needs of each group. The survey showed that white-collar professionals and graduates were interested in career advice, and thrive on interventions such as talent assessments. The survey also showed that 89 per cent of workers in Nairobi indicated employer-subsidized health and wellness programmes are important to them.
