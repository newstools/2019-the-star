A group of Central leaders has come together to form a movement to encourage residents to remain united ahead of the 2022 general election. Former Lari MP Mburu Kahangara said the disunity in the Jubilee government has frustrated its supporters. He said leaders from all regions in Central are in talks to form Zurura Zurura movement, whose activities will extend outside Mt Kenya region to garner more support. "We have realised that the Jubilee government does not really know what the people want, what they say when they see two teams speak differently on an issue and what the people are planning for the future," Kahangara said. He said Zurura Zurura will enlighten society on the need to elect leaders who will reach out to them, address their plight and meet their needs. Kahangara urged residents to support the current administration, saying it's the legislature that has become untameable and frustrating the government's development agenda and the war on corruption.
