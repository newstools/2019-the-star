Shalom Community Hospital, Machakos branch, has been closed and its managing director, Dr George Onyango. arrested. Governor Alfred Mutua on Monday gave the facility up to 6pm to finish attending to outpatients and 24 hours to clear the wards and transfer them to other facilities. Mutua said his government has revoked the hospital's business permit and Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board has revoked its operational licence. The facility’s closure and arrests were ordered by Mutua after he visited the hospital accompanied by officials from Ministry of Health, Nursing Council of Kenya, Clinical Officers Council, Pharmacy and Poisons Board and Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board. The group toured the facility to investigate KBC correspondent Jonathan Mutiso’s son’s death at the facility on Sunday. “Investigations have established that Shalom Hospital, Machakos branch, has myriad process failures, the hospital lacks proper procedures and staffing, the death of the infant could have been prevented, clinical officer and pharmacist gave the wrong dosage of a drug to be administered - 20 times more than expected," Mutua said. He said the person who administered the injection was not a trained health worker but a hospital attendant.
