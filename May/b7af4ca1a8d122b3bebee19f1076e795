James Rodriguez will leave Bayern Munich this summer when his two-year loan deal comes to an end, according to those close to the Colombian. The 27-year-old has struggled to impose himself in Germany, making just 20 league appearances this season for Niko Kovac’s side. The Bundesliga giants have the option to turn his move into a permanent one, with an option-to-buy clause of £36million inserted into the deal. But, according to ESPN FC, Rodriguez is set on resisting any attempts to prolong his stay and is ready to head back to Real Madrid. Rodriguez is by no means certain to have a role if he returns to the Bernabeu, with Zinedine Zidane, the man who sanctioned his loan deal in 2017, back at the helm. Indeed, the winger is desperate to secure more playing time, and as a result a permanent move away from the Spanish side is likely this summer. There are no shortage of suitors for the former Monaco player across Europe. Serie A champions Juventus have been closely linked, and are favourites to land Rodriguez should a move away from Real Madrid be sanctioned.  His father has previously stated a move to the Italians would be a ‘good decision’ for his son.
