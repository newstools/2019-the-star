Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has reportedly set down a 12-month window for Manchester United to clear out players who are now deemed surplus to requirement. Big changes are afoot at Old Trafford, after the Red Devils finished the previous campaign in poor form and failed to achieve Champions League qualification. Solskjaer has outlined which players are no longer in his plans, and has started to plan a transfer rebuild for the summer of 2020 and beyond. The Norwegian boss wants the club to get rid of as many as 14 stars and wants the process to be completed within a year, according to a report in The Sun. Ander Herrera and Antonio Valencia have already departed the club, while defensive duo Matteo Darmian and Marcos Rojo are likely to follow. Ageing star Ashley Young is expected to remain until next summer, before being ushered through the door. United are ready to listen to offers for striker Romelu Lukaku, who has fallen behind Marcus Rashford in the pecking order under Solskjaer. Lukaku has been heavily linked with Serie A giants Inter Milan, who are yet to make a formal offer but want the Belgian to be the first big-name signing under incoming manager Antonio Conte. Another point of contention for United is the uncertain future of Alexis Sanchez, who has failed dramatically since his high-profile move from Arsenal. United are understood to be willing to cut their losses on Sanchez and move the player on, but his eye-watering wages may prove an issue in attracting potential suitors. Youngsters James Wilson, 23, and Regan Poole, 20, are set to be released by after their contracts expire.
