Actress Catherine Kamau, alias Kate Actress, says she had settled on raising her child as a single mother before getting married to Philip Karanja. "Men can smell desperation from far," Kate said in a Q and A conversation with her Instagram followers. "I honestly wasn't looking for a man to marry me because my heart was shattered then and I had committed myself to giving my son the best." The former 'Mother-in-Law' star said real men also notice a focused, ambitious woman, especially one who loves her child unconditionally. Philip, who was once Kates' director, confirmed in a previous interview that what attracted him to the actress is her hard work. Kate said, "The way you carry and value yourself as a single mum will determine the kind of man you will unconsciously attract."
