A criminal case in which two traders are charged with failing to remit to the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) over Sh3.2 billion in revenue in a span of two years will proceed to full hearing on August 7. Dhavai Vinobhai Soni, Bhupathiraju Maheswara Varma and their company Shreeji Enterprises (K) Limited have denied eight counts of claiming value added tax (VAT), falsifying books of accounts, affecting payment of VAT, making incorrect statements about VAT paid, failing to remit VAT and failing to pay tax. According to the prosecution, the total amount involved is Sh3,268,065,307. Soni, a director of Shreeji Enterprises and  Varma, the financial controller, have denied the eight counts filed against them by the KRA prosecutors.
