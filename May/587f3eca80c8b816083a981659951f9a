Police on Tuesday gunned down a gangster who had been terrorising residents at Rhoda Market, Nakuru. Five other suspects escaped. Detectives, acting on a tip-off from the public, raided a house they had been hiding in. Gas cylinders, pangas and a knife were confiscated during the operation. A manhunt for the other five suspects is ongoing. Two suspected robbers were shot dead last year by police officers at Manyani Estate in Nakuru after a robbery incident. The two were among four robbers who had broken into a house and stolen household goods.
