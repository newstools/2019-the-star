We are in the age of lotteries and betting. Betting companies offering increase by the day and every day, a winner is announced. But the consistency of the winners leaves me puzzled. I have never seen a physically challenged winner. Do they not bet? Do people from far-flung areas not participate in these lotteries? Something is not right. These companies are pulling Kenyansâ€™ legs. Let fairness prevail. As the betting control has banned the daytime advertisement of agencies, let them go further and verify winners before they are announced.
