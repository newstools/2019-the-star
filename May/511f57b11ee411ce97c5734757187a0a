Kenya Basketball Federation Premier League leaders Thunder will hope top marksmen Griffin Ligare, Kevin Chogo and Faheem Jum show up in their dominant form when they tackle visiting Kisumu Lakeside at Nyayo National Stadium gymnasium tomorrow. Ligare, Chogo and Juma were crucial in Thunder’s 65-45 thumping of Umoja last week and will once again be the stars to watch. Second-placed Ulinzi Warriors, who are also enjoying strong form, take on Eldoret-based Eldonets who have impressed in their debut at the top. Both teams won last week as the soldiers crushed Emyba 88-62 while the fearless Eldonets stopped Strathmore University Blades 76-73. Women's champions Equity Bank confront Storms, who were beaten 49-41 by Tangit Sparks. Belinda Okoth and Betty Kananu will be key.
