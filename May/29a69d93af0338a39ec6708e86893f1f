The Directorate of Criminal Investigations on Saturday arrested seven suspects with millions of fake US dollars. Stephen Mark, Noah Amollo, Ian Otieno, Jotham Mugo, Joseph Majanga, Peter Otieno and Kevin Otieno were arrested after a sting operation following intelligence reports. “We arrested seven suspects and recovered millions of fake US Dollars after a sting operation in Kilimani area,” said the DCI. The arrest comes days after a similar operation led to the arrest of six suspects with fake gold in the same area. Two weeks ago, 14 suspects were arrested in a police operation over fake gold and counterfeit currency rackets in Nairobi. Eight of the suspects were arrested in Langata and millions of fake US Dollars and 100kg of fake gold found in a house at the junction of Mukoma and Kiboko roads. Among those arrested included four foreigners- a Congolese, two Tanzanians, one Nigerian and four Kenyans. The seven will be  arraigned in court on Monday.
