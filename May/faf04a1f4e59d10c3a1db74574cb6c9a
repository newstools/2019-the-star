Juventus have insisted striker Paulo Dybala won’t be going anywhere this summer despite interest from Real Madrid, Manchester United and Manchester City. Argentine striker Dybala has struggled for goals this season, scoring just 10 times as opposed to 26 during the previous campaign. His form slumped after being force out of position to accommodate Cristiano Ronaldo, who joined from Real Madrid for £100million last summer. And speculation that Dybala may be on his way out of Juventus increased when his brother, Gustavo, said there was a ‘good chance’ he will depart, adding ‘he needs a change.’ The two Manchester clubs and Real were among the clubs mooted as potential destinations for Dybala, who is valued at £85m. But now Juventus sporting director Fabio Paratici has tried to pour scorn on any suggestion Dybala will be leaving. He said: “He is one of our players, we have great confidence in him. The investment we made four years ago and the renewal of his contract is proof of this. Dybala is a Juventus player, a very important player for us.” Dybala, 25, himself tried to play down speculation over a move. He said: “My brother’s statements? He spoke for himself. I spoke to the club and Fabio Paratici and they know what I think. I want to stay at Juventus again next year, I want to continue playing here.” “It is obvious that Juventus must make their choices, also based on the new manager that will arrive. However, I want to stay here.” Manager Massimiliano Allegri departed the club after five seasons in charge at the end of the season.
