The technicalities claimed by county bosses towards fictitious spending are hard to believe. Kenyans elected leaders who were supposed to be responsible. Being a county boss means you have people in every department and are able to tell what they are doing; especially in a matter of such importance as public funds. Those employed to handle accounts and information systems have 10 years experience. Such situations leave voters with regrets of claiming devolution. If a leader can not handle a county, what shall we expect when elected at the national level?
