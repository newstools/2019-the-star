While Chelsea’s Pedro might not be mentioned up there with the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the best player of the generation, he now holds an accolade no one has ever held before. With Chelsea’s thumping 4-1 win over Arsenal in the Europa League final on Wednesday, Pedro has become the first man to win arguably the five top trophies in world football. Pedro has now won the Champions League, Premier League, Europa League, World Cup, and the European Championship, a feat never achieved in history. Plus, as stats company Squawka points out, Pedro has won a lot more than just those five titles. PEDRO’S TROPHIES 1x World Cup (Spain) 1x European Championship (Spain) 1x Premier League (Chelsea) 1x FA Cup (Chelsea) 1x Europa League (Chelsea) 5x La Liga (Barcelona) 3x Spanish Cup (Barcelona) 6x Spanish Super Cup (Barcelona) 2x FIFA Club World Cup (Barcelona) 5x UEFA Supercup (Barcelona)  Playing for Barcelona, the Spanish national team, and now Chelsea, Pedro has become something of a serial trophy winner. In terms of international titles, Pedro won the World Cup in 2010 and the European Championship in 2012 with Spain. He’s won the Champions League three times, and added the Europa League to his European collection on Wednesday night. Domestically, he won the Premier League with Chelsea in 2017, adding an FA Cup trophy in 2018. And of course, he was around for Barcelona’s era of dominance in Spain. He won La Liga five times, the Spanish Cup three times, and the Spanish Super Cup six times. He’s also got two Fifa Club World Cups and five Uefa Supercup wins to his name. All in all, that’s 24 major trophies, and at 31 years of age, he still has the potential to win a few more.
