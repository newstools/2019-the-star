Paris Saint-Germain are preparing to blow their summer transfer budget on three Real Madrid players when the window reopens. According to French newspaper Le Parisien, the Ligue 1 champions are interested in bringing Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Isco to the Parc des Princes. They claim that PSG will offer around £180million for the trio, who are all available if Real Madrid’s demands are met. Zinedine Zidane has personally told Bale that he is not in his plans for next season, while Kroos has struggled for form and Isco has been out of favour. Real are planning their own summer overhaul, with Eden Hazard and Paul Pogba among Zidane’s top targets. Selling Bale, Kroos and Isco would help finance a spending spree as they attempt to get back on track after a hugely disappointing season. PSG are said to have a particular interest in Kroos, although bids for Bale and Isco could depend on whether Julian Draxler and Edinson Cavani depart. The French giants want to cash in on the German, who has attracted the attention of Bayern Munich, while the future of Cavani remains up in the air. ]Bale would prefer to stay at the Bernabeu, although a fresh start in Paris may appeal if no interest from the Premier League materialises.
