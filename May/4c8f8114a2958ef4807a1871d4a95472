Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's surrogate is in labor. Kourtney Kardashian appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show on Thursday as she revealed that the power couple were currently at the hospital and their fourth child - a boy - is on the way. As the 38-year-old reality star was also set to appear on the show, their mother Kris Jenner was even shocked at the news. DailyMail.com has reached out to Kim and Kanye's representatives for comment. It remains unclear if the 41-year-old rapper and 38-year-old reality star will be in the delivery room though Kim was during the birth of daughter Chicago. Kim may not have been present but her three kids daughter North, five, son Saint, three, and daughter Chicago, 15 months made a surprise appearance with three more of their cousins. Ellen asked about why the middle Kardashian sister was absent and Kourtney, 40, replied: 'So, my mom doesn't even know this but Kim's surrogate went into labor so she's at the hospital. Kris, 63, appeared to be blindsided by the news as her mouth dropped and she said: 'What are we doing here? Come on, Ellen! Fire up the car.' Back in January, Kim confirmed that they were expecting their fourth child during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live. Though she also confessed to spilling the beans when she had too much to drink at their star-studded Christmas Eve party. She told Andy Cohen: 'I got drunk at our Christmas Eve party and told some people. I can't remember who I told because I never get drunk.' Kim gave birth naturally to daughter North, five, and son Saint, three, and the couple's third child Chicago, 15 months, was born via surrogate in January 2018. She battled with life-threatening condition placenta accreta during her two pregnancies and has been warned by her doctor to not carry her own baby again. The condition occurs when all or part of the placenta remains attached to the uterine wall after childbirth.
