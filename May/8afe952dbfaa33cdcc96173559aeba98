A power blackout forced the abandonment of a top Premier League tie between Strathmore University Blades and Equity Bank. The fiercely contested match at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium was called off at the break with the bankers leading 22-20. Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) fixtures secretary, Joseph Amoko, said the match will have to be programmed again soon. “I will have to reschedule it as soon as possible. Since I had already created space for makeup matches, finding a slot for it won’t be difficult,” he said. In the matches played earlier, Emyba crushed United States International University 75-58. Eugene Adera posted 18 points and Tony Mwenda scored 17 for the winners while Farm Onono provided 18 for the students. “Despite the loss, I am happy with the progress being made by my boys but there is still a lot of work to do,” said coach Cliff Owuor. In the women’s matches, Strathmore University Swords cut Kenyatta University Oryx 51-24 as Stephany Tongii top-scored with 15 points.
