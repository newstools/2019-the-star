One of Nairobi's 5-star grand hotels, Ibis Styles, opened its new rooftop restaurant to the public recently on Rhapta Road, Westlands. It aims to offer a great dining experience to customers in its two sections: 'Utamu', which is the casual dining restaurant serving continental cuisine, and 'Grab and Go', which is a takeaway coffee shop serving Rockbern coffee. Among those in attendance were Ibis Styles deputy GM Kennedy Kariuki, head of beverages Reeza Kanji and marketing manager Maryanne Njeri.
