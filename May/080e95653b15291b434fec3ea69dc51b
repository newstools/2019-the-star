The countrywideHuduma  registration exercise was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta on April 2 in Machakos county. Kenya Human Rights Commission, Nubian Rights Forum, and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights had tried to stop the exercise at Milimani Law Courts, but were overruled by the court. The groups had said that the condition that no one would access government services without a Huduma Namba was a violation of fundamental rights protected under the Bill of Rights. The High Court ruled the registration could continue provided Kenyans are not compelled to be listed and DNA is not taken as part of the drive. The exercise had been supported by various politicians who said it will ensure that the government provides its services to the citizens efficiently. The President had earlier dismissed claims Huduma Namba was connected to a cult or had a demonic meaning -666. Last month, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics stated that Huduma namba is different from Census, which will be conducted in three months.
