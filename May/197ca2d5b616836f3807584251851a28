Aaron Ramsey has reportedly been told he has played his last game for Arsenal due to injury. The 28-year-old suffered a minor hamstring tear in the second leg of the Gunners’ Europa League quarter-final win over Napoli which will keep him out for at least two months, according to the Sun. That means he would not be able to feature in the final of the European club competition on May 29 in Baku, should Arsenal make it past Valencia in the semi-finals. The Welshman was told by club specialists that his Arsenal career is effectively over after having his injury re-assessed last week. The injury is not severe and does not require surgery, however, it is season-ending, according to the report. Ramsey’s contract will expire at the end of the season and he has agreed a four-year contract with Serie A giants Juventus worth £400,000 per week. The deal was announced in February by the Turin club, and will see the Welsh international take home at least £83.2million over his four years with the Italian giants. Ramsey had been one of Unai Emery’s more consistent performers before being struck down in Naples. But after 369 appearances in Arsenal colours, it now appears he will not get a fairy-tale ending to his 11-year stay in north London. He joined the club as a teenager from Cardiff and has gone on to win three FA Cup titles, scoring the winning goals in the 2014 and 2017 finals against Hull City and Chelsea respectively. Arsenal face Valencia at the Emirates in the first leg of their Europa League tie tonight.
