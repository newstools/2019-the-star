Former Manchester United and Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard has made no bones about who he wants to win the Premier League this season. Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool side sit just one point behind Manchester City with two games remaining in what is widely regarded as one of the closest title battles in a generation. The former USA international, who spent the best years of his career playing for two of Liverpool’s fiercest rivals, has admitted he is firmly in City’s corner for the remaining two fixtures. “I hope Liverpool never win a title while I’m still breathing,” he told CNN. “We have two teams in the form that they’re both in. It’ll come down to the wire. If no one has a slip up, then City wins.” The 40-year-old spent four seasons at Old Trafford, where he played with current United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The Norwegian enjoyed a barnstorming start to life in the dugout, pushing United up the table and breaking into the top-four spots. However, United’s domestic and European form took a huge dip following the sensational turnaround win over Paris Saint-Germain back at the start of March. But Howard is backing his former team-mate to turn things around once again after a summer overhaul. He added: “Football’s funny. Pundits and fans are funny. He’s the right man for the job. Hopefully they will spend some money and they’ll get his players in and it’s no problem.” “It’s funny, right? Football: He comes in and wins every game for three months and he’s the second coming of Jesus Christ and everyone loves him and then they tear him down and are ready to throw him off the ledge.”
