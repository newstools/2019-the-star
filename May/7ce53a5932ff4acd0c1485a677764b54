A few months ago, he was moved from Mombasa where he stays and was taken to Malindi to stay with his elder sister," Mdoe told Word Is. Mdoe confirms that the health of his dad has been deteriorating for the last one month after he as admitted to Malindi Hospital. "He has been in Malindi, it reached a point where the doctors gave up on him and discharged him even before he was fully recovered. Since then he has been receiving treatment from home and on Sunday is when my aunt called me and broke the news that he passed on," he said. Mdoe says he will treasure the memory of his dad forever. "I will remember him as my dad, but I have no words to specifically remember him with but being a father is the most important thing despite the weakness he had." Swaleh's dad was buried yesterday.
