The government is riddled with fake things ranging from fake Canaan, a fake Jubilee manifesto, fertiliser and sugar containing mercury, fake parenthood, imagery devolution, supplying air to the government departments, fake gold and inhuman killings. This shows how a country is engulfed in a state of chaos. A rule of law applies only when you have a heavy pocket. Even though we seem to have a view of a democratic nation I am strongly pessimistic. Kenyans have not experienced the value of their votes after the five-decade-old Independence. Emuhaya
