President Uhuru Kenyatta has made an impromptu visit to Inland Container Depot at Embakasi along Mombasa road where seized containers are being stored. The President's visit comes amid cries from the businessmen over the long wait for clearance of their goods despite the SGR's freight services that have revamped it from its initial deathbed. Uhuru was accompanied by Interior CS Fred Matiangâ€™i, PS Karanja Kibicho and heads of the multi-agency task force. Data from Kenya Ports Authority shows the depot was receiving only four trains per week. Since the SGR freight services began, the facility is now getting 49 trains in a week.
