She says she has sung what she endured with her mother, the sacrifices they have had to make, being homeless, and her motherâ€™s struggles to make ends meet. In gratitude, Leyla has worked on 'I Believe', which talks about her struggles and change of fortune.

The inspirational and catchy song is produced by Kenyan-based American producer David Hunter. Her undeniable vocals have earned her fans across the country, not to mention her eloquent and captivating interviews, which have continued to grow her fan base.
