Chelsea defender David Luiz has revealed it is hard just watching the Champions League. The Blues missed out on the Premier League’s top four last campaign and are currently battling it out for a Champions League spot this season. Chelsea are in fourth place, two points above fifth-placed Arsenal, with just two games remaining. Following Chelsea’s 1-1 draw with top-four rivals Manchester United on Sunday, Luiz admitted it is difficult being an onlooker and emphasised the significance of the European competition. “It is important for our club. We are a big club and big clubs want to play in the Champions League,” he told The Evening Standard. “I have missed it. It’s great to be there, to try to play against the best teams in the world, the best players, the best coaches. Everybody has been missing that.” “I watch a lot of football, but when the Champions League anthem comes on I miss it. It’s hard, but we have to be humble and understand that we didn’t do the job one year ago and we had to pay the consequences. We have to be mature enough to understand that.” Maurizio Sarri’s side face Watford and Leicester in their final two league games as they look to remain in the top four. They also take on Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League semi-finals, which could provide an alternative route to the Champions League should they win the competition.
