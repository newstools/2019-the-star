The High court has temporarily suspended the hearing of a case in which former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero is challenging his prosecution in the Sh 213 million case. Judge John Onyiego stayed the hearing of the case which was scheduled to commence on Monday next week. The Judge said he will deliver comprehensive ruling on May 7 after Kidero argued that the charge of conspiracy leveled against him is defective. Kidero appealed to the high court after Magistrate Douglas Ogoti dismissed his application in which he claimed the charges were defective and that he ought to be tried separately. The former governor and ten others were last year charged in court accused of conspiring to commit fraud which led to the loss of Sh213,327,300 at the county government between January 16, 2014, and January 25, 2016 for services not rendered. ButÂ he faulted the charge sheet, arguing that the crime of fraud is not known in law, citing the Anti-corruption and Economic Crimes Act of 2003 which he argued does not define the alleged offence.
