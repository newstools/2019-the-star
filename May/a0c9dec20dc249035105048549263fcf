Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers says he has no extra motivation to do his former club Liverpool a favour in the Premier League title race when his side face Manchester City on Monday. Liverpool can return to the top of the table if they beat tonight but will only be in pole position to clinch the league title on May 12 if Rodgers’ Leicester can claim a point or better at the Etihad Stadium. Yet Rodgers, who went agonisingly close to winning the league with Liverpool in 2013-14, is only focused on his job at Leicester. “I am employed by Leicester. My focus is on Leicester City. There’s no comparison really,” Rodgers said. “It’s exciting to be involved but my thoughts are solely with Leicester and doing what we can to get a result. Liverpool back then was at a different stage. We had young players, loan players. We went from eighth to second in a couple of years so it’s a different dynamic. We deserved to finish second.” Leicester, who beat Arsenal 3-0 in their last league outing, are in contention for a potential Europa League qualification spot, lying three points behind seventh-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers. Youri Tielemans, on loan from Monaco, has contributed three goals and four assists in his 11 league games since arriving in January and Rodgers remains hopeful the midfielder will sign a permanent deal to extend his stay at the end of the campaign. “He came here in January because he wasn’t getting game time,” Rodgers added. “I think what Leicester have shown him is the opportunity that is here for any player, and in particular a young player. He has got a wonderful platform and base here to continue that development if there is something that is agreed between the clubs.”
