Napoli are preparing to make a move for Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa this summer, according to reports in Spain. Carlo Ancelotti is said to be an admirer of the former Chelsea forward and approves of his club’s interest in the Spain international. Costa has endured a tough first full season back at Atletico, who he rejoined in January 2018 after being frozen out by Antonio Conte at Stamford Bridge. According to Marca, Napoli are keen to add another striker as Ancelotti prefers to play with two up front but currently only has one recognised No 9 in Arkadiusz Milik. He is therefore keen to move for 30-year-old Costa, despite his underwhelming season in La Liga.  Costa has scored just five times in all competitions and was banned for eight games after abusing a referee. However, the Brazilian-born striker, who has 10 goals in 24 appearances for Spain, has won league titles in England with Chelsea and Spain with Atletico. His winning pedigree is attractive to Napoli, as they look to close the huge gap to champions Juventus at the top of Serie A. According to Marca, Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis is contemplating a loan deal with an option to buy. Costa played for Chelsea between 2014 and 2018, while Ancelotti was the manager at Stamford Bridge from 2009 to 2011, winning the Double in 2010.
