Premier League giants Manchester United and Chelsea have been put on red alert with Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani keen on a move to England. The 32-year-old striker has been a focal point of PSG’s vaunted attack since 2013, winning an incredible 17 trophies during his six-year stay. The Uruguay international has a contract at Parc des Princes until next summer, and, according to Italian outlet Calciomeracto, United and Chelsea are keen on making a move. They report that Chelsea had contacted Cavani’s representatives about a potential move to Stamford Bridge last January, but a deal never materialised. Chelsea, of course, have been placed under a transfer ban, which means they will not be able to buy any players this summer or in the winter. They are appealing against the ban, however, and are awaiting the outcome. It is understood, meanwhile, that United will undergo a massive overhaul this summer in order to mount a serious title charge next term. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is expected to ship out a host of star players, allowing room in the squad and budget to recruit some top names. Cavani would add much experience to the front line, especially with Romelu Lukaku’s Old Trafford future anything but certain, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic did when he made the move from Paris to Manchester in 2016. Calciomercato claim that Cavani is insistent on a move to the Premier League, having already plied his trade in France, Italy and Uruguay. And the forward opened the door to a move away from Paris just over a week ago in an interview with Canal+. “A lot of things happened this season. It’s different every year,” Cavani said. “The most important thing is to be able to keep our team together. My future? I have a contract here. One more year. What do you want? I’m good, serene, happy with the life and the supporters. But in football, you never know.”
