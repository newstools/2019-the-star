Former Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Mohammed Echesa has sued the government over his arrest which linked him to the recent killings in Matungu, Kakamega. Through a court order filed in Kakamega High Court, the respondents mentioned are the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji, Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti, Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai and the Attorney General Kihara Kariuki. The four mentioned parties have been ordered to appear in court for the mentioning of the case on May 24. The case order was issued and signed by the Kakamega High court on Tuesday. Echesa was arrested last Friday together with Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala and Mayoni MCA Libinus Oduor. They had been implicated to the killings in Matungu.
