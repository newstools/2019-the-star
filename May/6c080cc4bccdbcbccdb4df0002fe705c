BT Sport will show this season’s Champions League final between Liverpool and Tottenham for FREE on YouTube and their mobile app. In a bold move to attract more viewers, all football fans will be able to watch the game - without having to pay a monthly subscription for BT’s services. There will also be free screenings for Liverpool and Tottenham fans to watch the game - one at Space by M&S Bank Arena in Liverpool, and the other at Spurs’ new stadium in north London. Only 16,000 tickets have been allocated to each side at the Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid, leaving thousands of fans scrambling for a way to watch the match. Elsewhere, the Europa League final between Arsenal and Chelsea will also be shown in the same way, giving fans of all four English clubs the chance to watch for free. The latest broadcast technology will also be used for the matches, with BT Sport App viewers able to watch in VR360 on a mobile or tablet, and you can also choose different commentary options or camera angles. Ahead of the launch of 4K HDR later this year, BT Sport will also make the Champions League final available in HD High Dynamic Range (HDR) on the BT Sport App for BT Sport customers. BT Sport’s coverage of the Europa League final will begin with a preview show from Baku at 6pm on Tuesday May 28, with the final coverage being hosted by Jake Humphrey and guests including Martin Keown, Cesc Fabregas and Eidur Gudjohnsen. The Champions League final four days later will be hosted by Gary Lineker and guests include Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard, Glenn Hoddle, Jermaine Jenas, Michael Owen and Steve McManaman.
