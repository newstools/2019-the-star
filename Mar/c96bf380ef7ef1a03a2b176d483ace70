Clinical officers have signed a return-to-work deal to end their four-day strike. The Kenya Union of Clinical Officers (Kuco) and the Nairobi government reached an agreement on Monday. Health chief officer Mohammed Sahal, county secretary Pauline Kahiga, Kuco Nairobi secretary Tom Nyakaba and Kuco chair Reuben Raboso signed the agreement. The deal states that the union should suspend the strike from March 4. Kahiga said the clinical officers have gone back to work. “The meeting was a success and after the agreement, some officers resumed duty in the afternoon. Others will resume on Tuesday [yesterday].” The two parties agreed to a formation of six-member committee comprising union and county government officials to negotiate and recommend how to sort out the contentious issues in 30 days. The county government will sign a recognition agreement with Kuco as per the Labour Relations Act 2007 within seven days from March 4. They also agreed that clinical officers under probation will be confirmed as per the Employment Act 2007. Clinical officers, who have acquired additional professional certificates as per their scheme of service, will be placed or re-designated. The agreement also states that all clinical officers be given a comprehensive NHIF cover in place of the AAR medical cover, which was expiring last December. It was a Sh1.06 billion a year contract. Last Friday the union officials met Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko. He said most of the issues raised were meant to be handled by the County Public Service Board (CPSB).
