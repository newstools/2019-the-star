Mean Machine’s skipper Shadon Munoko will make his debut at this weekend’s Vancouver Sevens. Munoko left the country on Tuesday night to replace Homeboyz’s Brian Wandera, who picked a rib injury at the Las Vegas Sevens. Wandera injured the rib in the match against France and missed Shujaa’s fixtures against Argentina, Japan and Spain. Wandera is slated to arrive tomorrow from North America and will undergo probable surgery if need arises. Munoko played for Kenya Morans during the 2018 Safari 7s last year. He caught Paul Murunga’s eye during the National Sevens Circuit while playing for Machine as well as competitions like KUSA and Varsity Cup where Machine were victorious. He has been one of the standout players for the varsity side despite flirting with relegation in the Kenya Cup this season. Munoko is delighted to have joined the team in Vancouver as Kenya prepares to face off with Samoa, Fiji and Canada in Pool ‘B’. It’s an honour to represent the country and I look forward to be given the chance by the coach this weekend,” he added. Sources have revealed that industrious forward Herman Humwa and half-back Brian Wahinya are also struggling with injuries and the management will give them a chance to prove their fitness at today’s training session and Friday’s Captain’s run. Team manager Eric Ogweno said the mood in the team is good and they are looking forward to the event despite the minor setbacks. “The players are in good spirits. The key is to ensure we pick up more wins and rise in the standings to ensure we don’t get relegated,” added Ogweno. Ogweno said the young squad have adapted to the cold windy conditions in Vancouver. “It’s much colder than Vegas and the boys have adapted well and we hope they will be competitive come the weekend,” added Ogweno. Kenya lie 13th on the log with 17 points and reached the final last year in Vancouver, where thy lost to Fiji 24-12.
