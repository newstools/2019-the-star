Calls by some governors to have the National Government Constituency Development Fund scrapped and the money channelled through counties is a plot to cripple MPs, the Parliamentary Fund Committee has said. Governors had proposed to have the NGCDF abolished in the renewed constitutional changes call and have the money transferred to the counties to finance development projects. NGCDF is viewed as MPs’ carrot for political support as they use the fund to reward their cronies by either employing them in the committees and use it for development to get political mileage. MPs fought to retain the fund after the High Court declared some sections of the CDF Act unconstitutional. Auditor General Edward Ouko in his latest report said billions of shillings allocated to the NGCDF are wasted on projects that cannot be verified. Committee chairman Fred Kapondi said the kitty has enabled MPs to initiate projects that have brought positive change to the communities in their constituencies, especially in infrastructure development and education.The committee inspected projects funded by the kitty in Western region at the weekend. “We are impressed with the projects so far initiated by MPs which we have inspected. There is proper utilisation of the funds and projects are nearing completion,” Kapondi said. Navakholo legislator Emmanuel Wangwe said MPs will have a rough time dealing with their electorate if the fund is scrapped. “When these voters want bursaries and other support, it is us MPs they come to, not the governors, and sometimes we’re forced to assist them from our pockets because the allocation to constituencies isn’t enough,” he said. Lurambi MP Bishop Titus Khamala said delayed in the disbursement of the funds has made them incur extra costs on the Bill of Quantities.
