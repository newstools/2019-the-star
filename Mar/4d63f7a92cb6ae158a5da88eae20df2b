President Uhuru Kenyatta has distanced himself from 'corrupt' MPs and promised Kenyans to expect more arrests of leaders implicated in graft. The President said MPs were given a CDF kitty of Sh100 million every year and yet there was no development in their constituencies. Uhuru spoke on Thursday during the funeral of Mzee Thayu Kamau Kabugi in Murang'a county. “Let them tell you what they have been doing with that money. We don’t want stories that every time a mheshimiwa stands here it is just giving us stories. I got tired and I have already told them I have no business in their dirt,” he said. The President said Kenyans will soon see action taken against those suspected to have looted public coffers. “This is not a joke. People will be arrested and this microphone will not get them released. What will free you is either you pay back the money or spend time in prisons with other thieves.” he said. Uhuru urged Kenyans to vote out greedy MPs. Read: Cabinet reshuffle: Uhuru sacks Echesa, moves CS Amina to Sports docket “Do not think that these people are hearing you.
