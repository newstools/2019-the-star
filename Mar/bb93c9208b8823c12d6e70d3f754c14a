The High Court has declined to allow an application seeking to expunge a report by the EACC in the Sh8 billion Karen land case. Justice Elijah Ombaga of Lands Division in Nairobi on Friday dismissed the application by former NSSF managing trustee Josephat Konzolo, who had sought orders to lock out the vital evidence in the proceedings which weaken his grip on the ownership of the land. Konzolo wanted the report expunged as because it shows he acquired the land through forgery. But the judge in his ruling said the evidence being objected was recorded before the resignati√üon of EACC commissioners of the EACC. The judge concurred with lawyer Cecil Miller for Muchanga Investments Limited, which says it bought the land from Barclays Click here for the latest political stories.
