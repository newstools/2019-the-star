KCB Group reported a 22 per cent increase in net profit for the year ending December to Sh24 billion compared to Sh19.7 billion in 2017. Kenya’s largest lender by asset base attributed the growth to a reduction in staff costs which helped reduce the firm’s total operating expenses by 4 per cent to Sh35 billion. During the review period, the firm shrunk staff costs by 11.17 per cent to Sh17.01 billion compared to Sh19.15 billion in 2017 while directors’ emoluments were slashed by 14.65 per cent to Sh339.08 million. “This was on the back of solid operating income of Sh71.8 billion, largely from interest income, fees and commissions, and lower costs which reduced one per cent to Sh34.7 billion during the period,” KCB Group chief executive Joshua Oigara said when announcing the financial results. Loans disbursed to customers throughout the year grew marginally at 7.85 per cent to Sh455.88 billion resulting in a sluggish growth on interest income to Sh48.83 billion from Sh48.38 billion the previous year. The growth in net loans resulted in a 10 per cent jump in the lender’s asset base to Sh714.3 billion. Non funded income remained stagnant at Sh23 billion while interest on government securities rose at a much faster rate of 4.93 per cent to Sh12.98 billion. Oigara said total loans disbursed on mobile were up 84 per cent to Sh54.4 billion propelled by installed capacity of the bank’s digital banking platform KCB M-Pesa which tripled monthly loan disbursements. “We see this platform as an enabler in supporting transactional banking and credit access in a seamless manner as we strategically position the Bank to partner and collaborate with global payments providers and telecommunications firms to tap into the digital banking,” he said. KCB’s customer deposits grew eight per cent to Sh537.5 billion from Sh499.55 billion the previous year. The lender also saw a reduction in gross non-performing loans dropping 12.83 per cent to Sh32.69 billion. KCB’s loan loss provision dropped by about 50 per cent at Sh2.9 billion from Sh5.9 billion the previous year. The KCB Group Board proposed a final dividend of Sh2.50 per share to be presented to shareholders in the Annual General Meeting. If approved, this will bring the total dividend to Sh3.50 per share, an increase of 16.7 per cent compared to dividend per share offered in 2017. “Looking ahead, we expect our performance in 2019 to be driven by renewed investor confidence and rebound in the East Africa economy. The Banking sector is expected to grow in tandem with the broader market and therefore, we are optimistic we will maintain our growth this year,” Oigara said.
