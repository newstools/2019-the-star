Kenya’s most decorated golfer Jacob Okello has been awarded a Kenya Open slot despite losing out to Royal’s Eric Ooko in dramatic three-hole play off. The Magical Kenya Open — presented by Absa Group, which operates in Kenya as Barclays Bank — will be held at the Par 71 Karen Golf Club from March 14-17. Okello’s inclusion to the team means Kenya will now field 12 professionals and six amateurs after Uganda’s Philip Kasozi ‘ran away’ with one of the three slots at stake during the Safari Tour Golf Series. Ooko of Royal and Golf Park’s Okello finished joint 10th in the last Safari Tour on 12 over par 296 and proceeded to a three-hole play-off on the par four 7th, 8th and 9th where the former carried the day in dramatic fashion. In the three hole play off, Ooko sank in two birdies on the 7th and 9th and parted hole 8. Okello on the other hand parred holes 7 and 8 and bogeyed hole 8 to lose out to the Royal pro. Kenya Open Tournament Director Patrick Obath confirmed Okello’s slot in the European Tour-sanctioned event, which will see some leading Tour professionals compete for a prize kitty of 1.1million Euros. Okello, the resident pro at Golf Park landed his invitation courtesy of organisers Kenya Open Golf Limited (KOGL). “We are pleased to announce that Okello will be part and parcel of the Kenyan team by invitation. He joins the 11 local pros who qualified during the Safari Tour. The top eight professionals qualified from the Safari Tour rankings, while three (including Kasozi) participated in the pre-qualifiers. As usual the field will comprise of 152, six of who are local amateurs playing off scratch,” said Obath. Okello is best remembered for the dramatic 1998 Kenya Open Championship where he lost the coveted title in the play off. He has made the most Kenya Open appearances. His 11 under par 61 is the best round ever recorded at Muthaiga Golf Club.
