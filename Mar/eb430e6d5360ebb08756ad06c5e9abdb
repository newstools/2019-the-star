Shabana head Coach Gilbert Selebwa plans to sign at least five players when the transfer window opens next week. Selebwa said the club has already identified the players they intend to sign. “We want two prolific strikers. Our main strikers Moses Arita and Oscar Oketch have been out with injuries for some time now. Scoring goals has been one of main problems because we create a lot of chances,” said Selebwa. He also confirmed that the club will also go for defenders and a midfielder. “We want to inject some new impetus into the team as we seek promotion to the Sportpesa Premier League which is our target,” added Selebwa. He declined to reveal names of his potential signings until the contracts are sealed. Shabana are currently 9th on the log with 27 points from 18 matches. Selebwa aims to end the first round matches on a high when they take on Talanta FC on Saturday at Camp Toyoyo grounds. The mid season transfer window for Kenyan Premier League and FKF National Super League clubs is set to swing open on Monday next week. “Clubs will have close to one month to trade in fresh legs, as the window is set to close on April 8, 2019,” FKF said in a statement. As the transfer window opens next week, Nairobi Stima is unlikely to sign any player. “Even though I have seven key players on the treatment table, I don’t think we will be active in the market. However, I will sit down with my technical bench and make a decision,” said coach George Owoko. He said due to the injuries, he has been forced to convert defenders and midfielders to strikers. “The makeshift strikers have done a good job. I hope to have all the players fit by the time we start second round to enable us push for promotion,” added the Uganda
