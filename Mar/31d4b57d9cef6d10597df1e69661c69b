Unscrupulous businessmen have started sneaking banned polythene bags into the market in Kisii. “They and their cartels will soon be arrested,” county Nema director Leonard Ofula said yesterday. A spot check yesterday by the Star established that traders are using the thin, single-use bags to pack tomatoes, meat and other products. Traders use bags in the evening to avoid arrest by officials from the National Environment Management Authority. They hide the bags during the day. “Those with meat, vegetables, fruits and milk businesses use the small bags in the evening,” Ofula said. Plastic bags were banned on August 29, 2017. Ofula said Nema officers in plainclothes will crack down on notorious traders using the banned plastic. “Those engaging in the businesses should know that if arrested, they will face a two-year jail term or a fine of Sh2 million,” he said. He also warned residents who l allow the traders to pack goods for them in the bags, saying they too will be arrested. Ofula said that since the ban went into effect, most towns and shopping centres are clean and environment-friendly. The director also said the ban on plastic bags has also helped improve the flow of water in drains and in rivers like Nyakomisaro and Nyanchwa. The government won a court battle against manufacturers of the bags who wanted the ban delayed and said 80,000 people would lose their jobs. Smuggling remains a major problem, especially from Uganda where use of the bags is legal.Bags also are often smuggled at night in Lake Victoria. Rwanda banned the bags in 2008 and is constantly battling smugglers to keep the environment clean.
