Residents from Ilchamus community have appealed  for security as they prepare to bury five victims of a bandit attack in Arabal, Baringo South on Saturday. Two MCAs Renson Parkei(Mukutani) and Joseph Ole’barsalach were addressing the media in Kabarnet on Friday. “We are tired of losing lives every now and then, the government should get serious and provide us with enough security,” Parkei said. Among those killed during the 3am attack on Thursday last week were four children from Sokotei primary school, Kiserian primary school, and Sokotei secondary. A National Police Reservist (NPR) was also killed. Some 30 head of cattle were stolen during the attack but were recovered after pursuit by the police officers with the help of NPR and residents. The school children were on their half term when they decided to go and join the herders in pasture-rich Arabal grazing bushes before meeting their premature deaths. The MCAs however said some armed bandits have been rumoured to have regrouped with the aim of disrupting the burial. They are appealing on the government to provide sufficient security. The mass burial at Sokotei is expected to attract hundreds of residents and leaders from Baringo. The Ilchamus community is now appealing for an immediate withdrawal of the armed pokot herders grazing thousands of  livestock in parts of Noosukor, Rugus, Arabal and Ngelecha. The volatile areas are inhabited by the warring Tugen, Pokot and Ilchamus pastoral communities. Furthermore, Parkei appealed to the government to arrest and charge the merciless bandits behind the heinous killing of the innocent souls. He called for immediate arrest of the pokot leaders whom he accused of inciting their community to attack and steal livestock from the neighbouring communities. “The attacks now seem to have been upgraded into expansion of boundaries,” Parkei said.
