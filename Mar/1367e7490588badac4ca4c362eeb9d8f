Bungoma High School learners went on strike early Friday in protest against their principal. The students accused head teacher Samuel Kaunda of failing to address their grievances. One of them told the Star that they had made several complaints on the condition of the school but the principal ignored them. One of their major complaints was lack of water. The students said there is not enough water to shower, wash their uniforms and clean dormitories and classes. “There are taps in the school but the flow is too low. As a result the dorms and classrooms are dirty and student hygiene is poor,” he said in confidence. The students also complained of their toilets being dirty and in poor condition, saying their pleas to have new ones built have not been addressed.The dormitories are crowded, forcing them to share beds, they said. The learners also claimed that the school lacked enough learning materials, especially in the library and laboratory, “but our concern has never been taken seriously”. They said the library lacks adequate revision books and is often not open for them, while the laboratory has no apparatus or chemicals for practical lessons. The students took to the streets peacefully, chanting that they want Kaunda gone. They were however rounded up by police and returned to school but declined to go back to class. County Quality Assurance and Standards director Caleb Omondi visited the school and asked the students to be patient as they seek answers to their issues.
