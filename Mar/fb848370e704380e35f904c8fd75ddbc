Nanyuki Boys’ High School fraternity has started an annual walk to raise over Sh57million to replace the institution’s asbestos roofing that has been declared unhealthy. The school has all its buildings done with the cancer-causing roofing and the government has been adamant to fund the project. During the launch of the first 12km walk by students, parents and the school management on Saturday, they called for well wishers and especially “old boys” (alumni) to fund the project that will also incorporate building of a modern library. The management had earlier called on the government to come to their rescue to remove the roofing following a warning by the National Environment Management Authority over asbestos-related diseases. Principal Oliver Minishi said they planned to replace the roofing after Nema warned of hazards posed by the sheets. “We do not have the finances where the whole process of replacing and disposing the waste would cost Sh13.5 million.”
