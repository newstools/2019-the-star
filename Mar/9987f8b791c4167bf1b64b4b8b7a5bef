The Senate will draft a bill giving counties independence to control their own finances, Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has said. He said county assemblies must be empowered for devolution to succeed. The Speaker said assemblies should be allowed to handle their own finances and get funding directly from the Exchequer. Lusaka said county assemblies as currently constituted are weak and inadequately empowered to oversight powerful executives. “We need to set up a situation making county assemblies autonomous from the county government,” he said Lusaka spoke during the Sixth Devolution Conference at Kirinyaga University. By giving county assemblies independence to control their finances, they won’t bow to pressure from the executive.
