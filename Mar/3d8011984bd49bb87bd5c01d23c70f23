City Hall on Tuesday started a six-week campaign to remove 230 billboards erected either illegally or their owners are indebted to the county. Outdoor advertising companies owe the county more than Sh227 million. There are 860 billboards in the city. Out of this number, 630 are captured in the county’s database. The remaining 230 have been erected illegally. The exercise, which started on Waiyaki Way, is supervised by Planning executive Charles Kerich. Besides the huge outstanding amount, City Hall also loses more than Sh15 million every month in illegal billboards. “Some people just wake up and erect billboards anywhere without authorisation. Some even pull down others. It is a mess,” Kerich said.  Some rogue companies cut trees on roads to improve the visibility of their billboards. “Out of the 48 outdoor companies, only about 10-15 per cent are compliant in terms of regular schedules, making payments to the county government,” Kerich said. He said the companies have failed to pay and provide their occupancy schedules to the county as required in the new Outdoor Advertising law. This, he said, is despite the county governments holding several meetings with them to comply. The last meeting was in December last year. “We are open to regularise (their business) if the companies come to us and want to apply for the already put up billboards. However, for those with arrears of Sh20 million or Sh30 million, we shall not agree into any approvals until you comply,” he added. The executive said illegal erection of billboards along the city’s major roads has led to cluttering. Key roads that are cluttered are Waiyaki Way, Thika Road, Ngong Road, Lang’ata Road and Mombasa Road. Advertising is one of the key revenue streams for the county government, but has for years failed to raise set targets. Defaulting companies and weak enforcement are to blame.
