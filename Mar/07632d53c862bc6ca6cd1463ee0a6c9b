Piper's pub Management has denied claims that a tout died inside the drinking joint last week on Monday. This comes after reports from the deceased friends claimed that five men entered the pub at 3.00 am and confronted Misati before killing him. However, the pub manager who sought anonymity said that the tout together with his friends had their party inside the pub but left peacefully at around 1.00 am. "Our client left our premises safely, we had some police officers who had their party here too. Our security is well maintained and no one can easily access and cause mayhem," she stated. She added that the club provides its customers with the required security only when in its premises. "We provide security only to our clients when inside our premises, thereafter it's hard to follow them outside after their activities here. What happens outside is not our concern," it stated. The tout, Job Misati, who worked for ZamZam Sacco was last week stabbed to death by unknown people. He had attended a party organised by his girlfriend only identified as Liz at Piper's pub. Kasarani OCPD Robinson Mboloi said that the tout's body was found outside Piper's pub in Kasarani's Progressive area. Speaking the Star on Wednesday last week, Mboloi said that police are conducting investigations to arrest the culprits behind the murder. "We are working hard to make sure that those behind the murder are arrested and prosecuted. The information I have is that there was a disagreement on who was to pay for the bill before the murder," he said. Misati's body was later taken to Nairobi City Mortuary.
