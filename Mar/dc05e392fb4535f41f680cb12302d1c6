The NHIF says employers owe the public health insurer millions of shillings in unremitted contributions. The fund is working with the umbrella workers union Cotu to seek assistance from the DPP to recover the money. NHIF and Cotu held a two-day workshop for senior managers in Naivasha. Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli said the insurer and the union would in coming weeks seek the DPP’s intervention. “We have started the process of engaging the DPP so that he can assist NHIF in recovering millions from employers in unremitted contributions,” he said. Atwoli at the same time hit out at Health CS Cecily Kariuki for forming a task force to reform NHIF without involving workers.
