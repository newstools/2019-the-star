Mining CS John Munyes has been asked to stop issuing individuals and firms with mineral prospecting rights in Mwingi North. Area MP Paul Nzengu said on Monday that brokers are defrauding residents of their land by buying it cheaply. Nzengu said more than 10 companies have been licensed but none has a structured way of operation. He had toured mineral-rich areas like Ghai (limestone), Kakongo and Mbangwani. Residents accuse those who have been awarded licences of plotting to rob them of land. James Mwangangi and Koli Mwendwa urged the county government and local leaders to rein in the profiteers. They said some Mbangwani residents were “conned of their land” when they sold it for Sh85,000 an acre. “The prospector is approaching landowners individually and striking secret deals. We want the price of an acre standardised for every landowner, not negotiated,” Mwangangi said.
