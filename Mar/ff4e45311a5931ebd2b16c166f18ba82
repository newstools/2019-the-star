Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has warned his rivals against pulling down his billboards. He said on Monday that a billboard he had erected in Kirinyaga to welcome people to the 6th Annual Devolution Conference was destroyed on Sunday night. Kuria said he has other billboards countrywide. He has declared his interest in the 2022 presidential race. “Tone down political temperatures and show political maturity,” he said. He was addressing mourners during the burial of Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata’s mother, Margaret Wangechi. The outspoken lawmaker said he will not be deterred from his presidential bid and expressed optimism that Kenyans will support him to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta. “I’ll still go for the seat. I’ll go around the country asking people to vote for me,” he said. Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, who was present, dismissed Kuria’s remarks. He told Kuria to shelve his interests in favour of DP William Ruto. Murkomen said he will consider supporting Kuria for the presidency in 2075, prompting those in attendance to burst into laughter. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka called for respect among leaders. He said whoever destroyed the billboard should be charged. “I think being part of the Pangani Six gave Kuria the confidence to vie for the big seat,” Kalonzo said in jest. He was referring to 2016 when Kuria was arrested for hate speech and held at the Pangani police station, alongside five other lawmakers. Kuria appealed to politicians to leave the Catholic Church alone and stop politicising its operations. “The role of Catholic MPs is to protect the church, not from other churches, but from political thugs,” he said. Last Saturday, ODM leader Raila Odinga sparked debate when he said in Siaya county that the Pope had requested the Kisumu Catholic Archdiocese to return the car that was donated by DP Ruto for being a proceed of corruption. The car was meant for Archbishop Philip Anyolo.
