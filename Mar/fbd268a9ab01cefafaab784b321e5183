Good morning The government will not stop the importation of eggs from Uganda as restrictive trade measures would attract similar action from the largest buyer of Kenyan goods. Kenyan poultry farmers and entrepreneurs have been protesting over the grappling market due to an influx of eggs from Uganda, complaining they are struggling to break even due to the high cost of feed and low returns. Here are the other stories making headlines in the Star this morning. Prophet Owour took Saitoti's property Some of the Sh1.5 billion property that Doomsday Prophet David Owuor is accused of taking over belonged to the late George Saitoti. Without elaborating, the family of Jayne Muthoni yesterday told DCI officers that some of the property that Owuor and his church have taken was donated to their sister by the powerful Interior Minister Saitoti. Muthoni was a close confidant of Saitoti for many years and at one point was his main lawyer. Saitoti was a multi-billionaire who owned many high-end properties in Nairobi. _____________________________________________________ Uhuru scoffs at Ruto allies, vows graft fight unstoppable President Uhuru Kenyatta has scoffed those against the war on corruption, saying protestations in funerals and wedding ceremonies won't help. Speaking when he officially opened the Sixth Annual Devolution Conference in Kirinyaga county yesterday, President Kenyatta challenged those attempting to blackmail him to book an appointment with DCI George Kinoti if they have evidence he has stolen anything or involved in graft. Uhuru said the war on corruption has been left to experts and expressed hope that the officers have the ability to do the job. _____________________________________________________ 'Husbands from hell': Sprawling domestic violence in Mombasa Mary, not her real name, will celebrate this year's Women Day on Friday out of her matrimonial home because of persistent battering. She is among many Mombasa women, some in hospital, who have been assaulted, strangled and left for dead by their husbands. Some have had objects inserted into their private parts, organs cut and body incised. They are also battered for "cheating, looking smart, wearing make-up and smiling back at men." _____________________________________________________ Tired of waiting for better pay, police take Boinnet, AG to court Selective reviews of police officers' job groups and delayed salary increments have triggered a legal battle between graduate officers in lower cadres and their employer National Police Service Commission. IG Joseph Boinnet and AG Paul Kariuki have been roped into the tussle waged by officers from twin services Kenya Police and Administration Police. The aggrieved are thousands of officers left out in job group upgrades after submitting university degree certificates to the NPSC. They say the upgrades have been done in a discriminatory manner.
_____________________________________________________ Treasury releases money for subsidy fertiliser but it is a little too late The Ministry of Agriculture has received the node to procure subsidy fertiliser from the National Treasury but it is a little too late. Agriculture chief administrative secretary Andrew Tuimur said Treasury has said it will release Sh2 billion for subsidy fertiliser but the process of procurement takes about two months. “This is because you have to advertise and do an evaluation and this will take at least two months. Even if the government was to buy fertiliser, it will be too late since farmers will have planted the long rain crop,” said Tuimur. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
