Despite sitting rock bottom of the SportPesa Premier League table and with mounting pressure from the fans, AFC Leopards coach Casa Mbungo is optimistic that the race to escape relegation will begin with a positive result against Sony Sugar at Bukhungu Stadium today. The Rwandese coach has lost all the four matches he has overseen since taking over from Marko Vasiljevic last month and will be seeking his first win besides restoring the fast-fading glory of the second most successful football club in the country. Mbungo attributes his poor start to life at the den to injuries, which have denied him the luxury to select his priced stars but predicted a change of fortunes in the near future. “I am confident of escaping relegation despite being winless in the matches I have been in charge. The weeks I have been around have been tough as injuries to senior and dependable players have played a major role to the losses. We play Sony tomorrow (today) and we have prepared for the match with the ambition of coming back to Nairobi with the three points,” said Mbungo. Bandari will be boosted by the return of forward William Wadri as they seek to maintain their stay at the top of the log against Mathare United at Mbaraki Stadium. Team manager Wilson Oburu, confirmed that Wadri, who has been ill, has recovered and will be available for selection. However, the club will be forced to do without the services of left back Fred Nkata who suffered an ankle injury against Tusker last month.
