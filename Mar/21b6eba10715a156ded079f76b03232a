The rift between Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati and Members of the County Assembly is widening. The MCAs have kicked out the majority leader, Florence Fulano, for “being cosy with the governor”. Fulano, of Nasa, was kicked out after 26 out of 36 MCAs petitioned Speaker Emmanuel Situma accusing her of incompetence. The ward reps accused Fulano of failing to lead the House as she served the interests of Wangamati with wom they have been at loggerheads. “The role of the Assembly is oversight and not rubber stamping the wrongs of the executive,” deputy speaker Simiyu Omusai said,quoting standing order 15 (3). Trouble between Wangamati and the MCAs started when two MCAs were arrested for allegedly inciting the public not to pay taxes at the Chwele market, citing the county’s failure to provide water and build a toilet at the market. The two are Mukuyuni’s Meshack Simiyu alias Museveni and Barasa Mukhongo of Chwele-Kabuchai ward. The MCAs escorted the two to the Bungoma Law Courts expressing disappointment with the way Wangamati handled the issue. They vowed to no longer attend his functions and to sabotage him through the assembly. Fulano got herself in trouble with the Assembly when she attended a function by Deputy Governor Ngome Kibanani despite members resolving to give the executive a blackout. THREATEN TO IMPEACH The coalition replaced Fulano with Tuuti-Marakaru MCA Joseph Nyongesa. He will be deputised by area ODM chairman and Maraka MCA Ali Machani Mutoka Balala. The MCAs have also threatened to impeach Situma if he continues protecting the executive. “The next victim could be the speaker if he doesn’t change his ways of usually getting directives from the executive. We will be left with no option but to send him home,” one MCA said in confidence.
