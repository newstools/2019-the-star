He promised to put more focus on ensuring the existing gaps between the police and members of the public are bridged. "These gaps have exposed weak links between the police and citizens. We need a review that will help build confidence," he said. Kinuthia also said that career progression, promotion and transfers have, for a long time, been contentious issues that have resulted in some police officers being victimised. Former National Assembly Speaker Kenneth Marende, Justice Joyce Aluoch, Dr Zachary Mwangi, Elijah Kodoh, Peter ole Nkuraiya, Mukutar Abdi, and Lucy Wanja had been shortlisted for the chair's post but they did not make the cut. The commission will play a key role in streamlining the ongoing police reforms. The team is also expected to determine if police officers will get a salary increase.
