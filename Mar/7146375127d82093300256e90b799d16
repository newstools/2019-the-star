Kiirua Technical Training Institute students boycotted classes to protest against what they called their principal’s highhandedness, lack of equipment, run-down infrastructure and poor diet. They did not go to class on Thursday and Friday. Twenty-four students were arrested on Thursday and are being held at Kirua police station cells. The institution has 700 students. Area OCS Waita Nzioka said they were holding the 24 students. “Let them be processed, get bond and the appear in court on Monday. We are consulting with the BoM to know who we should arraign in court on Monday. Not all of them,” he said. When the Star visited the school on Friday evening, the Board of management was in deliberation to solve the problems amicably. BoM chairman Miriti Naivasha said no property was destroyed by the students. But the students claimed they were harassed and beaten, before some of them were arrested by police during the march to the education offices in Meru town They accused principal Daniel Mugambi of increasing the school fees violating the fees structure. Students Jana Ododah, Charles Muriuki and Joan Achieng called for the transfer of the principal. They said their hostel rooms are in bad shape and lack electricity and water. “When we complain about food, we are dismissed that we’re here to study, not to eat,” Ododah said. He said hygiene standards in this school are extremely poor and toilets are blocked. The students also said they lack enough learning materials, especially in the library and the laboratory. Principal Mugambi said trouble started on Thursday, when students refused to take tea, demanding to be served in big mugs, not cups. “This is the only grievance. We told them food must be regulated. The maximum fee per student is Sh56,420. Of the amount, 30,000 is capitation paid by the government, meaning their balance is Sh26,420.”
