A cancer patient yesterday became the first Kenyan to be treated with a new radiation machine cutting treatment time from 40 minutes to two minutes. The Varian Halcyon radiotherapy system has been installed at the Nairobi West Hospital. It was developed in 2017. Kenya becomes the third African country after South Africa and Morocco and the sixth in the world to have it. Dr Solomon Mutua yesterday said it will ensure much better outcomes for cancer patients than the old treatment. Besides the shortened treatment period, the machine targets the precise location of the tumour, minimising the risk of other organs being affected. “We are able to give the required dosage of radiation. Because the treatment is targeted, we can direct high doses of radiation. There is no risk to surrounding structures. This means the side effects to the patients are also dramatically reduced,” Dr Mutua said. The platform also was designed to make it easier for technicians to use, requiring nine steps instead of 30.
