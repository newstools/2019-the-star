From the first tee off to last four ball finishing on the 18th, I think it’s safe to say we all enjoyed ourselves. I most certainly did and we look forward to hosting more of these as the year progresses in order to continuously develop the game of golf in Kenya.” Jane Mwaura was the lady winner of the day, carding in 42 stableford points after recording 22 points on the front nine and 20 on the back nine respectively.
