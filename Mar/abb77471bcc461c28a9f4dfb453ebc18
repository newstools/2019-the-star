Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has said the government will pursue officials who misuse Sacco funds. Matiang’i was addressing Police Sacco delegates on Wednesday in Nairobi during their annual meeting. The CS called upon the disciplined officers to join Saccos for their own benefit. “One way in which we are going to support co-operative movements is to punish and bring to book those who misuse the Sacco resources. We will go after these people. We are hot on the trail of the Ekeza officials and others,” Matiang’i said. He said they will not spare any individual involved in the loss of Sacco funds. Matiang’i also said there are measures in place with the Ministry of Housing to ensure that 20 per cent of every housing programme is set aside for the police department. The CS has also encouraged Police Sacco to develop training programmes for its members on how to spend and manage their savings. His remarks come as Ekeza Savings and Credit Cooperative Society is on the verge of collapsing because of managerial issues. Members are demanding their cash back.
