Nondies coach Willis Ojal has said his side must be clinical if they harbour ambitions of being in the Kenya Cup playoffs. Ojal made the observations following his sides last gasp 18-17 win over Homeboyz at Ruaraka grounds over the weekend. “We did not have to wait until the last minute to confirm our victory. We could have scored a bonus-point victory if we were clinical in attack,” said Ojal. Nondies are fourth on the log with 41 points. However, Ojal was delighted with his forwards’ work rate: “Our forwards won us the game. They created a platform and we were able to get over the line in a bruising contest,” added Ojal, who was forced to play some players out of position due to unavailability of his preferred choices. Nondies next face champions KCB on march 16. Try scorers for Nondies were Ian Njenga, Brian Njenga and super-sub Steve Sumba with Moses Begi adding a conversion. Homeboyz replied through prop Meshack Akenga with Evan Asena adding three penalties in a topsy-turvy match. Homeboyz coach Simon Odongo rued a lapse of concentration in the final seconds for the loss. “We showed lack of composure in the final seconds of the match. Being in the lead, we needed cool heads to see off Nondies,” said Odongo. At the same venue, Impala thrashed Blak blad 38-19 to secure a bonus-point victory which moves them to fifth on the log on 34 points. Bill Omondi scored a brace with Davis Makori, Samson Onsomu and Anthony Odhiambo scoring a try each for the Sarries. Xavier Bett added five conversions and a penalty. Archadius Kwesa scored a double for the students, who trailed 24-3 at half time. Quins stay third on the log on 42 points after securing a bonus-point win of 43-43 against Mwamba in a high scoring match played at Kenyatta university. Nakuru moved to sixth on the log after a 33-18 win over relegation-threatened Strathmore Leos. Kabras remain top of the log after a 41-22 win over Mean machine as KCB edged Menengai Oilers 29-20.
