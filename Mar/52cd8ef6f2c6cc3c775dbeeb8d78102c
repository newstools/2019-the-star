Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has called on elected leaders to support the onslaught against corruption by adhering to Chapter Six of the Constitution. He said the legislation which requires leaders to uphold integrity and resist the temptation to enrich themselves with public funds will help win the war on corruption. “If we don’t expunge this temptation of stealing and stealing, I think we are missing it,” Kalonzo said. “If we don’t win this war against graft, we would have lost it." The former Vice President asked governors to lead by example in that resolve. He spoke on Saturday at Serena Hotel, Nairobi, during a thanksgiving ceremony to mark the first anniversary of the handshake. While describing corruption as a national curse, Kalonzo praised President Uhuru Kenyatta for his determination to win the war against the vice. “We need to give him a big clap,” he said. The Wiper chief asked politicians to stop politicising the ongoing war against graft, adding the Big Four Agenda runs the risk of collapsing if the war is not won. “The moment we think this is targeting an individual, we are losing it. It must be whenever a thief is a thief, please avoid the temptation to think this has something to do with an individual,” Kalonzo said. A section of leaders allied to DP William Ruto have consistently said the war on corruption was being used to fight political wars in readiness for 2022.

The former Vice President said Kenyans expect high profile prosecutions in the runaway corruption in the country that is gobbling away billions of shillings of public funds.
