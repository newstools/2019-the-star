Lonyang Karen 29, and Kopuonyang Achom 42, had been trailed by detectives from Wednesday. West Pokot Police Commander Mathews Kuto said DCI officers informed him on Wednesday evening that they had received information that some criminals have been supplying illegal guns. He said they were following leads after tipped off that the suspects planned to transport the bullets through West Pokot. Kuto said officers went to Kitalakapel and laid an ambush where they killed the two criminals. "The suspects refused to stop when the police flagged them down on a motorbike. Officers gave chase, and the suspects fired at the detectives. DCI officers killed the two suspects at the scene," he said. Kuto said other armed suspects dashed into a thicket and escaped. "Officers found 1,850 bullets in a sack that the suspects were carrying. We are yet to establish how many suspects expects and the number of guns they had," Kuto said. He said the bullets were to be sold in West Pokot and in neighbouring counties that are grappling with insecurity. "We have been investigating the source of bullets being used by bandits along the border. Police have established that there are many illegal guns in the wrong hands," Ruto said He said illegal firearms being used by bandits are sneaked in from neighbouring countries. Kuto appealed to residents to help the police to catch merchants of illegal firearms trade. Click here for the latest political news
