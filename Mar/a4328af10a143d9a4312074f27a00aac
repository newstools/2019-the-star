The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission says that it will not be intimidated by individuals or institutions in its fight against corruption. Some MPs have claimed the commission is targeting individuals close to Deputy President William. CEO Twalib Mbarak termed the sentiments political, adding that the views would not deter the agency from the purge against corruption. Twalib said the commission is independent and only answerable to Parliament. Despite frustrations in the courts, the EACC is determined to fight on, he said. “The politicians are entitled to their thoughts but this shall not deter us from fighting graft regardless of who is involved.”
