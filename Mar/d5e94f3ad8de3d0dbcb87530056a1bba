The lion statue erected by Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko at the University Way roundabout has elicited mixed reactions from Kenyans online. Majority of Kenyans on Twitter said the statue is poorly sculptured and only serves to ridicule the city instead of beautifying it. “Even the lion himself appears not convinced he's a lion,” Njeri Maina said. Another user by the name Laura asked “Why, Sonko, why?" Vasco da Gama said, “Now that we are on the topic of beautification, does anyone have pictures of those disco-looking lights on the highway roundabouts? Please share... we need to stop this while we can.” “No! This is not my city. First Christmas and Disco Lights (that are still on in March) then this... no,” another user tweeted. “What is going wrong with our Kamba bratha?”Asked Cess Mutungi. Idris Mukhtar said Sonko's administration has a great sense of humour. “Don't you just love Nairobi county government, his administration's sense of humour is on another level. Lord of mercy!” he said. ”What is this for?” asked Akel love. In 2015, the Nairobi City County government under then governor Evans Kidero allegedly splashed more than Sh140 million to beautify the city. This was done just days before former USA President Barack Obama and Catholic Pope Francis made their inaugural visits to Kenya.
