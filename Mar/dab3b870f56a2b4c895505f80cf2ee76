Northern Kenya pastoralists yesterday urged their governors to ensure peace prevails in the region. They said their livelihoods can only thrive in a safe environment. Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Amey said the resolutions made during the Pastoralist Leadership Summit must be implemented, with peace initiatives prioritised. The participants cited peace and security, census and referendum, economy and livestock, equalisation fund, women, boundaries, education, and land and natural resources. The summit held on Friday in Garissa brought together 14 counties. Others were Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Marsabit, Isiolo, Mandera, Wajir, Lamu, Tana River, Narok, Kajiado and Samburu. The pastoralists have been afflicted by perennial conflicts arising from cattle rustling, and clashes over grazing grounds, water and pasture. Many lives have been lost and animals stolen. Amey said border rows must be resolved, especially between Isiolo and Garissa, Turkana and West Pokot, and Baringo and West Pokot. He called for a partnership with the national government and security agencies. “You can never talk of socioeconomic development without a peaceful environment. Our undoing has always been conflicts over resources,” Amey said. “We can’t continue like this year in year out. Our leaders must take the lead role to find home-grown solutions.”
