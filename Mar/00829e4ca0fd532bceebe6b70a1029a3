The Political Parties Dispute Tribunal has suspended the decision by the ODM Party to expel Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa until the appeal lodged by her lawyer is heard and determined. The case filed under a certificate of urgency was lodged on Monday by Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen who is acting for her. The tribunal also barred the Registrar of Political Parties from striking Jumwa's name from the membership list of the party. "That pending the hearing and determination of the application herein, the 2nd respondent [the Registrar of Political Parties], by themselves, their agents, and or servant or employees be restrained from removing the name of the applicant from the membership list of the 1st respondent," the order seen by the Star read in part. The tribunal has ordered that the party be served with the suit papers pending the hearing of the appeal on March 8 at 2:30 pm. The Orange party's National Governing Council had on March 1, adopted the resolution of its NEC to expel Jumwa and her Msambweni counterpart Suleiman Dori from the party for supporting Deputy President William Ruto's 2022 Presidential bid.
