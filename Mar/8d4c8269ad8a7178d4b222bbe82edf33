Nairobi MCAs have recommended that companies contracted for the multibillion-shilling urban housing project be given a maximum of three years to finish. Planning Committee chairman Antony Kiragu said the time limit is mandatory for the project to be effective. The particulars are in a report of the Nairobi County Assembly sectoral committee on Housing on the consideration of the Sessional Paper 1 of 2018 on the Urban Regeneration policy. The  committee’s  recommendations will best fit the policy, according to the report tabled before the Assembly on Wednesday. The committee proposes that 90 per cent of labour and materials be sourced locally. “We do not want a scenario where we have materials being imported, when they can be purchased locally. This will create jobs for our unemployed youths,” Umoja One MCA Mark Mugambi said . The committee has also recommended that the county housing sector be given powers to allocate 20 per cent of the houses to county staff who qualify to own  houses. The report says the county will maintain control over the common areas in the estates. Residents will not be allowed to build extensions. The houses sold under the regeneration scheme cannot be sold before a lapse of five years since the purchase. County Executive for Lands Charles Kerich had earlier said people currently resident in the targeted estates will be given first priority. The committee has also requested that local leaders be made part of the steering committees to oversee the allocation of houses. Majority leader Abdi Hassan made the recommendation, citing publiv concerns. The units have a 15 per cent waiver on taxes, Kiragu said.
