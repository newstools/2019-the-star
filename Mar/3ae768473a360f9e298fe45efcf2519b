Students of Bungoma High School on Friday boycotted classes in protest against their principal. They accused Principal Samuel Kaunda of high handedness and failure to address their grievances. Contacted for comment on the accusations, the headteacher declined to speak to the Star. He directed us to speak to the county education officials, County Quality Assurance and Standards Director Caleb Omondi visited the school and asked the students to be patient. One student told the Star whenever they presented their issues to the administration they were dismissed. The students complained of lack of water in the school. They said bathing, washing their uniforms, cleaning their dorms and classes is a headache. “The hygiene standards in the school are poor. The pressure of water in the taps is too low,” a student said. Another student said the toilets are dirty and unfit for use. He said their pleas for more toilets have fallen on deaf ears. Students said they share beds and the dorms are congested. The infrastructure is in a poor state, they said. They also said they lack enough learning materials, especially in the library and the laboratory. The students did not break anything in the school but chanted on the street, saying the principal should go. Police intervened, but the students declined to go back to class.
