National Super League side Wazito have acquired the services of highly rated national U-20, Rising Stars midfielder Musa Masika from Kangemi All-Stars. Masika has been outstanding for Kangemi in the ongoing season and his passing and dribbling prowess caught the eye of the free-spending Wazito who won his signature yesterday. The youngster, who is a sibling to Harambee Stars winger Ayub Timbe, is set to muscle for the starting berth with Tusker loanee Amos Asembeka and U-23 midfielder Teddy Osok. The Laiser Hill alumni who had the chance to train with the youth side of Belgium-based Genk last year becomes the third signing of the club in the ongoing transfer after Asembeka and Lloyd Wahome who joined from Tusker. The club’s coach Fred Ambani believes the arrival of Masika will aid mitigate fixture rotation through rotating his midfielders but ruled out shipping in new players. “It’s a good and quality catch whom I believe will replicate his form with Kangemi here. He is a good player and will help us get wins in our already congested fixtures. I will be rotating him with Osok and Asembeka which I hope will bear fruits. We do not have plans to bring more players as we have enough players.”
