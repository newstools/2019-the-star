A man who accompanied the body of the son of Nairobi tycoon Jimmy Baburam to hospital had a cut on his face, a court has been told. Chripus Munga, a clinical officer at Matambo Hospital, told judge Dora Chepkwony that Jacob Shmalze was among four people who were in the ambulance that brought in David Baburam’s body. Others were Amina Shiraz, who is accused of killing her husband David, the ambulance driver and a first aid provider. Munga said he was directed by the first aid provider to certify that David was dead. “After checking for any signs of life, I declared him dead. I documented his death and gave out a certificate,“ he said. Munga said David was bleeding from the nose. He said while recording the death, he received a call from a person who claimed to be David’s personal doctor. “The doctor told me that until his death, David had been suffering from bacterial meningitis and that he had been under medication,” Munga said. Another witness, call analyst Daniel Hamisi who is attached to Safaricom, said there was constant communication between a number registered under the accused’s name with several other numbers. He could not tell what was discussed.
