Residents of Olkaria in Naivasha barred Nakuru county officers from accessing the area to investigate the sub-division of Ng’ati farm. The officers, members of a task force investigating how the land was demarcated, found themselves on the receiving end as residents said they were not aware of the visit. Naivasha sub-county assistant commissioner John Opondo intervened to cool tempers. He told the crowd that the visit was meant to address woes of Ng’ati farm members. The committee is led by Nakuru County Secretary Gichuhi Njoroge and has been sitting in Naivasha to determine how the land was sold to KenGen. Opondo downplayed the incident, attributing it to misinformation which he said had been resolved and the fact-finding tour went on as planned. Shadrack ole Tiampati, a resident, said that they were surprised when government vehicles arrived in one of the villages without notice. He said elders had not been informed of the visit, hence the tension before the problem was resolved. “We saw government officers who were taking notes and pictures of our houses and this prompted us to act but the air has now been cleared,” he said. Last month Governor Lee Kinyanjui constituted the committee to find a solution to the wrangles surrounding the 12,000-acre farm.
