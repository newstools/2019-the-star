Squatters on controversial land in Kiambu have been urged to wait for the decision of the courts and the government on the status of the land. The 419 acres are the subject of a feud between the squatters, the National Land Commission and Kenya Forest Service. The squatters say former President Daniel Moi directed in 1995 that they be resettled on the land. KFS says the land is part of a forest and has never been degazetted. The NLC has recommended that the land be subdivided among the squatters. Kiambu assistant county commissioner Caleb Nyongesa met squatters yesterday and told them the parcel is still forestland, despite the NLC decision. “As of now the land is nott degazetted and we need to wait for that process to happen where everyone involved would be called in broad daylight,” Nyongesa said. The administrator warned people are masquerading as surveyors, brokers and owners of the land who aim to con unsuspecting buyers. “The allotment letters were drafted in the 1990s but the process was halted and there have been no other allotments done,” he said.
