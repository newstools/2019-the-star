Homa Bay doctors yesterday resumed work after a three-week boycott. They struck a deal with the county government on Friday. They had complained about delayed salaries and poor working conditions. Residents welcomed the decision, saying they have suffered during the strike. Many patients could not afford services at private facilities, they said. “We’re relieved after doctors agreed to return to our public hospitals. Most people are poor and can’t afford high charges at private hospitals,” patient Monica Anyango said at Homa Bay Referral Hospital. Anyango appealed to Governor Cyprian Awiti’s administration to fix the problems that led to the strike.  “Let both the parties abide by what they have agreed upon because their disagreement hurt many innocent residents who need services.” On Friday, officials of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union met county officials to sign an agreement.  They were KPMPDU county secretary Isaiah Ogwe, Health executive Richard Muga, Nyanza KMPDU chairman Kevin Osuri and the county KMPDU liaison officer Amos Dulo. The county promised to pay their salaries by the fifth day of every month. It also committed to promoting medics and ensuring re-designation by the end of this month. Muga said his office is open to discussion on improving doctors’ welfare. “We’re assuring that their controversial salary of February will be paid by March 8. This will help us end the thorny issue of salary delay,” he said.
