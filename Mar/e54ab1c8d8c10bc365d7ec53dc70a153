National Assembly minority leader John Mbadi has urged Deputy President William Ruto to stop defending government officials accused of graft. He said the recent claims by Ruto that only Sh7 billion had been utilised in construction of Kimwarer and Arror dams in  Elgeyo Marakwet implies that he defends government officials who face investigations. “It is wrong for the Deputy President to say that only Sh7 billion was spent yet the whereabouts of other funds meant for the projects are still under investigation. Such comments show there is something he knows which other Kenyans don’t know,” Mbadi said. He spoke on Saturday during a fundraiser for construction of a dormitory in Okok Secondary School, Ndhiwa constituency. The Directorate of Criminal investigations (DCI) queriedTreasury CS Henry Rotich for four consecutive days over the use of Sh21 billion meant for the dams. Mbadi said Ruto's conduct was questionable. He urged Ruto to wait for investigators to give their report on the matter. The Suba South MP said Ruto's comments will derail the war on graft. “The fight against corruption needs concerted efforts hence it is wrong for somebody of the Deputy President's status to issue remarks that cushion a  suspect,” he added. On Friday last week, ODM leader Raila Odinga lashed out at Ruto for saying that only Sh7 billion had not been accounted for. He said Sh7 billion was not pocket change "for buying mandazis". Raila went on to ask how Ruto knew it was Sh7 billion that had been used. Ruto hit back saying that he is the Deputy President and it's his business to know how much is used on projects.
