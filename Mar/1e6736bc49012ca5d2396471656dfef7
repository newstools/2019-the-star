The taxpayer may lose Sh2.5 billion if the government terminates the tender of Itare Dam contractor CMC di Ravenna. Termination of the contract is among the three options for the Itare Water Supply Project after the company was declared bankrupt. CMC di Ravenna was declared bankrupt on December 4 last year after it was admitted by the Court of Ravenna to a pre-bankruptcy procedure under Italian Insolvency Law. Water Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui yesterday said the government has three options. “First is continuation with the company under the current contract. Two is to assign the remaining works to a third party or another contractor and the last option is to terminate the contract with CMC,” Chelugui said. The CS said terminating the contract will be a big loss because the government will have to pay Sh2.5 billion to the contractor as per the agreement. “We are opting to assign the remaining works to a third party or another contractor so that we do not lose money,” Chelugui said. CMC di Ravenna was awarded the Sh29 billion contract to complete the works in two years from April 6, 2017.

In 1998, the government completed the feasibility studies which confirmed technical and financial viability of the project. It was not immediately implemented due to lack of funds. The project was revived in 2011 as demand for water in Nakuru rose. The government hired a consultant to review the feasibility studies, engineering designs and preparation of tender documents. The study included hydrological, geotechnical, economic and environmental impacts. It concluded Itare Dam was the most viable long-term source of water for Nakuru town, Kuresoi, Molo, Njoro and Rongai and Chepsir, Chepseon and Kedowa townships in neighbouring Kericho county. Itare Dam was subsequently adopted as one of the flagship projects under Vision 2030 to be developed as matter of priority. The scope of the project includes a 57-metre high dam with 28 million cubic metres storage, 1.2m diameter 113km pipeline, 14.5km bulk transfer tunnel and water storage reservoirs. Tenders for implementation of works were advertised in February 2014 by the Rift Valley Water Services Board in which contractors with ability to mobilise funds were invited. Evaluations were done and CMC di Ravenna of Italy was awarded the contract. The National Treasury concluded the funding agreement with BNP Paribas Fortis and Intesa Sanpaolo of Italy on July 15, 2015. Chelugui said payments certified to the contractor until December 2018 amounted to Sh11,399,322,188.43. “However, actual payment done is Sh11,064,145,694.78. These payments include the advance payment of 15 per cent of the amount of Sh4,346,060,923.82,” he said. “The securities provided by the contractor under the terms of the contract are advance payment of Sh4,346,060,924 ( 15 per cent of the contract sum) and performance security amounting to Sh2,897,373,949 ( 10 per cent of the contract sum).” Read: Construction of Itare Dam continues to spark controversy in Nakuru, Bomet The total amount of physical works done as at December 2018 was Sh6,374,222,688 plus securities of Sh13, 617,657,561.04. That amount exceeds the payments effected to date of Sh11,064,145,694.78 by Sh2,553,511,866.26. Chelugui, who spoke at a press briefing at his Maji House office, denied mismanagement of funds under his watch, saying he was not under investigations as reported in the media. The media reports follow allegations of possible loss of approximately Sh90 billion meant for construction of Arror, Kimwarer and Itare dams in Elgeyo Marakwet and Nakuru counties. Chelugui said Arror and Kimwarer dams are being implemented by the Kerio Valley Development Authority which is under the Ministry of East African Cooperation and Regional Development. On Tuesday, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi asked Chelugui and Treasury CS Henry Rotich to resign over the alleged mismanagement of funds meant for building dams. The former deputy prime minister said officials heading parastatals mentioned in the scandals should also quit for effective investigations. “For a start, the Cabinet secretaries for Treasury and Water and the officers associated with this matter, including the CEO of Kerio Valley Development Authority, must go,” Mudavadi said in a statement. He was responding to media reports that Sh38 billion was irregularly allocated to an Italian company to build Arror Dam. The allocation was done without regard for procurement procedure. Other alleged scandals involved Itare Dam Water Supply Project in and Kimwarer Multi-Purpose Dam Project. The two were to be built at a cost of Sh40 billion and Sh28 billion respectively. “We spent Sh21 billion on a project that had not even been designed. We carried out due diligence several months after making the payment,” the ANC boss said.
