Yesterday airport workers at JKIA went on a wildcat strike. The Kenya Aviation Workers Union issued a strike call on February 27 but the Labour court issued an injunction against it on March 5. The strike was therefore illegal. Security services dispersed the striking workers yesterday. Some said the reaction was too violent but the strike was causing expensive inconvenience all over the world. JKIA is an international hub and high-security complex. It should be protected from strikes. The absurdity is that the strike was unnecessary and pointless. The union claims that there are potential job losses if the Kenya Airports Authority and Kenya Airways go into their joint venture to run the airport. But the intention is not to cut jobs but to integrate KAA and KQ operations. In any case, the joint venture is not yet approved and decided. They were striking about a possibility, not a reality. To make matters worse, other airlines besides KQ use the airport. Why should they be penalised for KQ’s alleged failings? Yesterday’s strike was economic sabotage. The government was right to break it up.  Quote of the day: “It is not important to make many pictures but that I have one picture right."
