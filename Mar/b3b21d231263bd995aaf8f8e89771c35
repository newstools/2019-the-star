Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has asked the National Assembly to adopt in totality the Public Accounts Committee report and the IEBC. Wandayi said the Pubilc Accounts Committee has set the ball rolling in realising a fresh start in electoral reforms as envisaged by the voters. "We have prepared a report that, if adopted by Parliament, will send the current crop of IEBC officials home," Wandayi said. The MP said his committee had tabled in Parliament a comprehensive and highly incriminating report against IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati, former CEO Ezra Chiloba and the commissioners. Addressing journalists on Monday in Ugunja, the legislator said said the committee knows what is ailing the electoral commission and if they get the House support, then "elections will never be the same again". "The report is due for debate this week and I am asking my fellow MPs to embrace it for elections prosperity in the country," Wandayi said. He said the committee found Chebukati and his Commissioners culpable of abuse of office and corruption during the 2017 General Election. Chebukati has, however, been on record accusing Chiloba of misuse of funds. He added that Kenyans don't trust the IEBC to conduct another election as currently constituted. Wandayi said the move will also help in dealing with corruption during elections and in general especially with the intense fight against the menace. The Ugunja MP at the same time thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta and Nasa leader Raila Odinga for allowing the war on corruption to take shape through the handshake. The PAC chair reminded residents that even as the country moves forward by the handshake unity, the next urgent issue that should be supported by everyone in the war against corruption. He challenged church leaders to use their powers in the fight against electoral malpractice and corruption. He further asked the church to use the pulpit in urging the remaining commissioners of the IEBC to voluntarily resign before they are kicked out.
