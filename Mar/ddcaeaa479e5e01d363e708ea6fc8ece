The government has been told to ensure  money stolen by corrupt officials is recovered. Limuru MP Peter Mwathi yesterday applauded President Uhuru Kenyatta for his stern warning that individuals involved in graft will be arrested. Speaking in Gitui area in Murang’a county at Kamau Thayu funeral service, the President warned that high profile individuals involved in graft will be arrested since they have caused projects to stall. “You will soon see action being taken against the suspects if they do not return stolen public resources within a few days”  Kenyatta warned. The MP said in Limuru town  that communities should not complain that their tribesmen are being targeted, but support the war against graft. “This is one of the legacies we shall see of Uhuru’s administration,” he said. Mwathi said whoever will be named as a suspect should step aside and to allow for investigation, urging the suspects not to rush in court and obtain court orders to stop their investigations. He asked the investigating agencies to quicken  their jobs and arrested the suspects and charge them. “The challenge faced by our investigation institutions is that suspects rush to court where they obtain orders to block their investigations ending up in derailing the process” the MP said. “Let us not see this government as if it has failed. We have seen CSs, PSs, directors and other senior officials sleeping in police cess, being charged in court and remanded because of corruption” he noted. He asked residents to pray for DCI George Kinoti and Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji since they do not negotiate with criminals, saying corruption is a crime that need to be eliminated. “Our President needs our prayers and support as well as the DCI and the DPP because he has to leave a legacy and hand over a clean government to his predecessor,” he said. Mwathi said if corruption is not stopped, it will eat the country from all corners and leave it like a shell.
