Four Somali women are to be charged with the murder of a Kenyan Standard Seven girl in Nairobi’s Eastleigh Estate. The suspects include the teenager’s 28-year-old aunt Nathifa Mohamed, who lived with her. They lied to detectives that the 14-year-old girl was an orphan. However, preliminary investigations established that the girl’s mother was alive but mentally ill, prompting the detectives to look for her other family members. “From the autopsy, she was killed with a blunt object. There were injuries in the head and other parts of the body,” Parklands deputy Directorate of Criminal Investigation officer James Koech said. The autopsy, done last Tuesday, showed the body had multiple injuries. The mother and the grandmother arrived in Nairobi on Tuesday after the girl was buried the previous day per Muslim tradition. The father is expected in Nairobi from Ethiopia, where he lives. The suspects wanted to bury the girl on Sunday morning, but were intercepted by the police at the South C mosque at 5am, as the burial arrangements were under way. The police took the body to the City Mortuary for postmortem. The officers arrested the aunt the same day based on the preliminary investigations on the the death of the girl who had been missing for days. “We were informed by the public about the mysterious death of the girl and initiated investigations. We already have the suspects who now face murder charges,” Koech told the Star by phone. Neighbours and the police told the Star that the decomposing body had been cleaned and was ready for burial. “There were blood stains on her clothes,” human rights activist Florence Kanyua said by phone. Police arrested the aunt the same day and arraigned her on Monday. The prosecution sought to detain her and at Pangani police station for 14 days as they concluded the investigations. The other suspects were arrested on Monday and arraigned on Tuesday. The court allowed the police to detain them for 11 days.
