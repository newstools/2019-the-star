The eagerly anticipated Kenya Rugby Union elections slated for tomorrow have been postponed. In a statement to newsrooms, KRU said the union is having consultations with the government before holding elections. Outgoing chairman Richard Omwela said they received a request from the government to push the elections to a later date. "We got a letter from the ministry asking us to postpone the election and allow for consultations," he said. Former vice chairman Sasha Mutai, secretary Oduor Gangla and former treasurer Asiko Owiro are eyeing the chairman's post. Ten candidates have shown interest in the position of director. They include incumbents Ian Mugambi and Roy Olendo. Others are former internationals Ken Thimba, Angela Olum, Sara Otieno, Peris Mukoko as well as former directors John Kilonzo and Musa Ndale.
