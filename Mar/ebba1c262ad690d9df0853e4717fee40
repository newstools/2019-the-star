Igembe North MP Maoka Maore has told off Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen for attacking DCI George Kinoti. On Thursday, the Senator said the DCI had scandalised the projects and weaponised the alleged loss of funds to wage 2022 political war. He said Kinoti lacks expertise relating to the probe of the Sh21 billion Arrow and Kimwarer dam scandals in Elgeyo Marakwet county. Murkomen said Kinoti should have first sought expert advice before starting investigations. However, Maore told Murkomen to leave Kinoti alone and stop politicising the war on graft. He spoke on Saturday in Laare town, Igembe North Constituency when he met education stakeholders.

We are happy President Uhuru Kenyatta has trusted the DCI to spearhead the campaign. Those who are corrupt are afraid," Maore said. The MP said no particular community is being targeted, and suspects should carry their cross. He said it is laughable that Deputy President William Ruto said the money stolen is only Sh7 billion and not Sh21 billion. At the same time, Maore said the President should leave his Big Four agenda and concentrate on fighting corruption which is getting out of hand. "If he fights corruption then the four pillars he wants in his legacy will fall in place," he said. In 2004, Maore then the MP for Ntonyiri, tabled the Anglo Leasing scandal documents in Parliament.
