The introduction of left attacker Yvonne Wavinya in the third set is what the Kenya Prisons' women's volleyball team needed to come back from a set down to see off Nkumba of Uganda 3-1 in the ongoing African Club Championship in Cairo Egypt on Monday night. The side coached by Josp Barasa booked an early quarter-final slot with a game to spare with six points in pool 'D'. The local champions had recorded their first win a win against ASEC of Ivory Coast on Sunday and will now line up against GSP of Algeria on Tuesday to wrap up the preliminary group stages. The Kenya Volleyball Federation league champions had paraded experienced Brackcidise Agala, promising Pamela Maisaisai, Emmaculate Chemtai, Joy Luseneka, Lorine Chebet, Edith Wisa and Libero Elizabeth Wanyama to do duty for the former Champions. Prisons who last won the club championship in 2013 lost the first set 26-24 before they held nerve to see off the stubborn neighbours 27-25 in the second set to level the set 1-1. Prisons coach Barasa then rested Masaisai and Agala for Wavinya and Evelyne Makuto as the wardress began to make inroads in visibly stubborn opponents. But Prisons shoved off the stiff competitions and reception and service s which were wanting in the early stages of the game to finally fall in place as they went ahead to win the third set 25-16 to enjoy a 2-1 set advantage before they sealed the win with 25-22. In the interview, Barasa said, "It was tough we started badly especially reception and service but recovered after doing substitute bringing in Wavinya, Nkumba have really improved their game."
