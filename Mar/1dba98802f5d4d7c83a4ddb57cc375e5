Kenya’s Shujaa are seeking to bounce back from their poor show in Sydney earlier this month as they line up for Las Vegas Sevens tomorrow. Paul Murunga’s charges picked a solitary point in Sydney after a promising display in Hamilton, where they had picked up seven points. Murunga blamed the poor performance on fatigue from the young players who were not used to the long travel and playing consecutive tournaments in the World Sevens Series. Shujaa will open their campaign against USA at 3:50am. Shujaa were crushed 41-0 in Sydney by Mike Friday’s charges and Murunga will be hoping that his side can give the hosts a competitive game. Shujaa face France in their second match at 6:29am having been blown off 40-17 by the Europeans in Sydney. The two sides have had close matches this season with Kenya beating France 19-15 in Hamilton and losing lost 21-17 and 19-12 in Dubai respectively. Murunga’s charges will the face Argentina in their final pool game at 11:58pm. The two sides have met twice this season with Argentina winning 34-31 in Cape Town and Kenya exacting revenge 36-7 in Hamilton. Shujaa lie 13th with 12 points from four tournaments. Murunga said they have settled well and hope that Kenyan fans will turn up in large numbers and cheer the side to victory. “ I am urging all Kenyan fans to support the side and cheer us to victory. They will be our 8th man on the pitch,” added Murunga. Forward Herman Humwa and utility back Michael Agevi are in the squad and are expected to add experience to the side. “It’s good to have them back in the squad. They will offer leadership and the younger players will learn from them in the two-day event,” added Murunga.
