City Hall’s Finance department is on the spot for spending Sh1.2 billion beyond the budgetary limits approved by the Controller of Budget. County Assembly Budget and Appropriations Committee on Wednesday said the money was spent yet it was supposed to be kept in County Revenue Fund. A report by CoB shows City Hall spent more than it received through exchequer issues. The report on expenditure in counties for the first quarter of 2018-19 raised concerns on spending at source. Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo said the Transport and Public Works department was allocated Sh15.39 million for development yet it spent Sh474.6 million on projects. The department spent Sh217 million on recurrent expenditure despite an allocation of Sh177.5 million. “Despite receiving a grant of Sh15.3 from the CoB to fund the expenditure, the county reported an expenditure of Sh534.9 million on development, which implies weak internal controls,” the report says.
