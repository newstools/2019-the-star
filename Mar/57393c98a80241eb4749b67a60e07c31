His father, known for TSS bus services, maize mills and other businesses, died in January 2017. Son Mohammed Tahir said that at the age of 47, his father gave him allowances,which he used to support his wife and children . “ I was dismissed by my father as a director,” he said. His father fired him when he tried to tell him about anomalies in the running of TSS maize millers. He was testifying in the trial of James Mwangi, Aweys Mohamed, Zein Ahmed, Zahir Abbas and Victor Were, charged with conspiring to defraud TSS firms of billions of shillings. They are accused of forgery and transferring shareholders’ details without consent. The case was adjourned to April 4.
