Beatrice Karanja, the Director of Communications for the Northern Rangelands Trust and Communications Advisor for Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, has been appointed to the judging panel of the annual Tusk Conservation Awards. Held since 2013, the awards recognise three dedicated African conservationists yearly for their outstanding and inspirational efforts to conserve Africa’s natural heritage, often at huge personal risk and in the face of enormous challenges. “I am delighted that Beatrice has accepted our invitation to join the independent panel of judges for the Tusk Conservation Award," said Tusk’s Chief Executive Officer, Charlie Mayhew. He added, "She will bring her own wealth of knowledge to the judging process and we look forward to working with her as we build on the success of these prestigious awards which were established by the charity’s Royal Patron, Prince William, to recognise the unsung heroes of conservation working across Africa.” Following her appointment, Karanja said: “I am truly honoured to be part of such a venerable group of conservation elders. By inviting me on to this panel, Tusk Trust have truly demonstrated their investment in highlighting the voices of young Africans and especially women in conservation; taking up this role of identifying and celebrating those who are doing their part both large and small to protect Africa's nature and wildlife, is more than anyone can ask for." Karanja brings to the judging panel over 20 years of experience in communications, conservation, journalism and advocacy work in Africa. Her conservation acumen is further demonstrated by her service as a board member for The Mara Elephant Project, Kenya Wildlife Trust and S.A.F.E. Kenya - as well as her appointment as a Kenya Wildlife Service Honorary Warden for Kenya’s Southern Region, in recognition of her contributions to Kenyan conservation.
