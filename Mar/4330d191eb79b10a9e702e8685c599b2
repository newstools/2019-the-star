The government has been told to be making prompt payments to traders who do business with it. Speaking in Kisumu on Saturday, Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry Nairobi chapter boss Richard Ngatia said prompt payment by government will ensure they don't run into serious debts and in some cases collapsing. He also called for establishment of a special fund that will be helping small scale traders especially in the counties. "Establishment of SME fund will not only support growth but also ensure jobs are secured in a trickle-down effect. Prompt payment of traders by government will also enable them to meet their tax obligations and hence more revenue to government," Ngatia added while speaking at the Kisumu KNCCI office. Present was Kisumu county KNCCI chairman Jared Ochanda. Ochanda is the longest serving chamber member in Kisumu. Ngatia has expressed his interest to become the chamber's president to succeed Kiptono Kittony whose term came to an end last month. The elections will be held in two months time. Others eyeing the top job include Nairobi businessman Gor Semeleng'o and James Mureu. Two candidates, Laban Onditi and Stephen Mbugua have stepped down in favour of Ngatia. The chamber has proposed a raft of of changes including renaming the national chairman's position to be refered to as the chamber president. Speaking in Kisumu, Ngatia said his focus was to have the chamber transform and directly have impact on traders under SMEs. The Kisumu chamber endorsed Ngatia candidature for Kncci president position. During the meeting, the Kisumu delegates called on the chamber to roll out the county empowerment program across the country. The delegates also asked the chamber to engage line ministries to have tax amnesties to SMEs for cash strapped businesses. Ngatia said the chamber will embark on capacity building to ensure they meet all tax obligations as provided by the law.
