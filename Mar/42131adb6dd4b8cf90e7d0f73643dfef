Shabana coach Gilbert Selebwa is targeting to end Nairobi Stima’s unbeaten record when the two sides collide tomorrow at Gusii Stadium. “Everything is possible. Even Ushuru and Wazito were at one point unbeaten,” said Selebwa. “We need to approach the game with the seriousness it deserves and compete for maximum points now that we are playing at home.” He, however, admitted that Nairobi Stima will not be pushovers. “They are a good side with a lot of experience. We are equal to the task and ready to take them on,” said the coach. Selebwa said they will miss the services of their top striker, Oscar Oketch, who has been out with injury. He is expected to return to full training in two weeks. Nairobi Stima are third on the log with 37 points, one behind leaders Ushuru and second-placed Wazito while Shabana are sixth with 26 points from 17 matches. The Kisii-based side’s last outing was a barren draw against Administration Police. A win for Stima will see the power men rise to the summit of the table at least for 12 hours because Ushuru and Wazito will play their respective fixtures on Monday at Camp Toyoyo. In the first match at 2pm, Ushuru will play bottom of the table Kangemi All Stars while Wazito will battle Talanta as from 4.15 pm. In another game to be played on Monday, Kenya Police host Modern Coast Rangers at Karuturi stadium in Naivasha. Tomorrow, Administration Police faces Eldoret Youth at Camp Toyoyo in the first of a double-header. In the second game, Kibera Black Stars tackle St Joseph’s Youth. At Bukhungu Stadium, newly appointed Green Commandos coach, Fred Serenge, will hope to pick his second win of the campaign against Kisumu All Stars while struggling Migori Youth host Nairobi City Stars at Awendo Green Stadium. Fortune Sacco will look to return to winning ways when they host Coast Stima at Thika Stadium while Thika United play Bidco United in a local derby at the same venue.
