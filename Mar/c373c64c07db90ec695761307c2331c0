The Narok government is opposed to a decision by the EACC to summon 31 employees. It wants the court to intervene and issue temporary orders, stopping the EACC from summoning and questioning its employees. Also sought is an order stopping the agency from publicising or issuing press conferences on the matter under investigations. Governor Samuel Tunai, the county government, county secretary, Finance executive and Finance chief officer are listed as petitioners. The EACC and DCI are respondents. In suit papers the county says the matter is extremely urgent because if the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission is allowed to summon its staff, operations in the devolved unit will be disrupted. The procurement matter the agency is looking into is under probe by the Director of Criminal Investigations office, the court was told. The case comes at a time when governors and county officials are attending the 6th Annual Devolution Conference in Kirinyaga. The conference started yesterday. And based on that, the Narok government asked for the postponement of the questioning of staff, which was to start yesterday. According to suit papers the county got an initial letter from the DCI on December 10 last year, requiring it to provide original files for procurement and payments of all tenders from 2013 to 2018. The county was given eight days to submit the documents, which it did. However, on March 1 this year, the county received another communication regarding tenders, but this time from the EACC. The anti-graft agency requested the same documents, but covering procurement from 2014-17. The county informed the EACC it cannot comply with the request because the documents being sought were with the DCI. The EACC summoned two employees — James Wamugo and Caroline Okul — and questioned them for a full day, the county says.
