Leaders in Migori want the police to crackdown on an outlawed gang called Sangwenya which they claim is a security risk in the county. The leaders linked the gang to chaos witnessed at the Migori county assembly last Friday. "Sangwenya" is largely used to suppress dissent. Speaking to the Star on Tuesday, several MCAs said the gang has been hampering democratic space in Migori and is being used by certain individuals to intimidate leaders. North Kanyamkago MCA and Majority leader George Omamba called on DCI George Kinoti to move with speed and tackle the group. “They are people who are known, they want permission sought from them on any issue in Migori. We have talked to the police and want the whole country to know we are not safe,’ Omamba said. “'Sangwenya' are youths allied to Migori politicians, gradually they have grown to a dangerous group,” Tagare MCA and Minority leader Nicholas Ngabia said.

Muhuru Bay MCA Hevron Maira, however, said the best way to deal with the gang is to offer them loans and economic empowerment. Migori ODM chairperson Philip Makabong’o said in the 2017 General Election, Migori was rocked by violence especially over the Governor's seat.
