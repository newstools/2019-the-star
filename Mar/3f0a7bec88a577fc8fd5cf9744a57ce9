President Uhuru Kenyatta has compensated a 77-year-old man
Sh250,000 for damaging his house. The rooftops of the four-roomed home of James Keah, a Kaloleni
resident, was on October 2017 blown off by the strong gust of wind caused by
the blades of a landing helicopter in which Uhuru travelled in . Uhuru had toured the Coast region to campaign for his re-election following the nullification of the August 8 presidential election. Kaloleni was among the constituencies likely to boycott the vote
as urged by  ODM leader Raila Odinga, who enjoys massive support from the
region. On the day Keah’s house was damaged, Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto were holding a rally at Kizurini Secondary School, which is next to the house. Keah was among the attendees “There were two helicopters carrying the President and Ruto,”
Keah said at his home on Friday. “I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw an open house. I had been
informed of the damage.” Coast Regional Coordinator John Elungata handed Keah the cash on
behalf of Uhuru. “I’m deeply touched by the president’s generosity,” Keah said. During Uhuru’s landing, the rooftop of Kizurini Secondary School
makeshift dining hall was also blown off. Some debris fell but none of the students who were at the time
having lunch was hurt. The school received Sh2 million in compensation. Deputy principal Naomi Kinuih said they used the money helped build a modern dining hall. “The new kitchen space is bigger and has modern equipment, which is making
cooking and serving meals more fun and efficient,” she said at the school. Elungata said Uhuru has been keen to repair the structures. “And as expected, he delivered on his pledge. The students in
this school and Keah are very happy,” he said. Kizurini students representatives Nelson Maitha and Fenny Kadzo
said they now spend less time queuing for food.
