The government has neglected the multi-billion shilling fishing industry, a major player in the blue economy has said. Saedo Foundation CEO Maj (Rtd) Mohamed Morowa said fishing can generate at least Sh200 million annually if taken seriously. His foundation has started a programme to train seafarers and fishermen in Mombasa on new and better fishing methods. “Our foundation has identified 1,965 youths in Mombasa who are interested in fishing and seafaring. Another 123 have been trained but need refresher courses,” Morowa said on Thursday. He spoke during a round table meeting on the blue economy with Vocational and Technical Training PS Kevit Desai at the Kenyan Coast National Polytechnic. Desai said the government has received a Sh1.2 billion World Bank loan to harness potential of the blue economy. The money will be spent on training. About 10,000 people are targeted for training at the Coast. Only 2,000 will be trained immediately. The training will include seafaring, safety and logistics. Saedo Foundation chairman Amir Thoya said,“Many people do not think fishing requires skills. They are wrong,” Thoya said. Seafarer Rauchi Hajj said fishermen have inferior equipment. “In Kenya, we do not have a fishing course. We have to go to Bagamoyo in Tanzania for fishing courses."
