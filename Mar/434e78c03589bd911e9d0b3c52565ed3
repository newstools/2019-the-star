Kenya’s High Commissioner to Pakistan Professor Julius Bitok has denied reports awash on social media that he had been arrested in Islamabad over allegations of defiling a minor. Bitok who spoke to the Star on phone says he has asked the police to investigate those behind the fake reports aimed at tainting his name. “Am talking to you as a free person in Islamabad and not from custody. There is nothing like that and consider it as malicious and fake news,” said Bitok. The envoy blamed his rivals in Uasin Gishu county of circulating the fake news as a way to taint him ahead of the 2022 gubernatorial elections in the region. “As an envoy, I know my position is critical and there is no way I can engage in such immoral behaviour. I highly respect myself and my country,” Bitok said. The envoy vied for the Uasin Gishu governor seat in 2013 and lost to Jackson Mandago who is completing his second and final term as the county boss. Bitok is now considered by many as one of the front runners for the seat in the absence of Mandago. However, if he will contest he will likely battle it out with prominent businessman Bundotich Kiprop 'Buzeki' who gave Mandago a run for his money in the last elections. The envoy said time for politics was still far away and at the moment he was concentrating on his work. “The President has made it clear that we should focus on working for our people. Those who are idle should not start dragging my name into such issues so that they try and deviate me from my job. They will not succeed,” he said. Bitok has been Kenya's envoy to Pakistan since 2014. His tenure has witnessed an increased volume of trade between the two nations. Others whose names are being floated as possible successors of Governor Mandago include Uasin Gishu Senator Professor Margaret Kamar and Kesses MP Dr Swarrup Mishra.
