ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi yesterday attacked Deputy President William Ruto over remarks that only Sh7 billion was lost in the Arror and Kimwarer dam scandal. He said the statement indicates Ruto and his allies are “admitting there is a problem, but are now debating on the quantum of the problem.” Mudavadi accused Ruto of intimidating DCI George Kinoti by trying to imply he is not doing his job professionally. “Why not allow the investigative agencies to do their job? Why is DCI George Kinoti and the EACC calling people, demanding documents associated with this project?” he asked. The ANC boss spoke to reporters after a church service at JCC Parklands. The DCI is probing suspected loss of Sh21 billion in the two projects being implemented by the Kerio Valley Development Authority (KVDA). At least 107 firms have been summoned to shed more light on their engagement in the project. On Thursday at the Supreme Court, Ruto hit out at the DCI, saying the agency was prosecuting its cases unprofessionally. He repeated the comments in Nyeri on Saturday.

You think we are fools?” the DP asked. Yesterday, Mudavadi said Ruto’s remarks were a sign that ‘somebody somewhere is beginning to panic’ adding that “by implication, the sentiments are showing that someone doesn’t want the DCI to work independently.” “We should allow the DCI and the EACC to do their job. They are trained to do it, the politician is trained to talk not do the investigative work. Why are people nervous?” he said. He was with MPs Tindi Mwale (Butere), Ayub Savula (Lugari), and Vihiga Woman MP Beatrice Adagala. Click here for the latest political stories.
