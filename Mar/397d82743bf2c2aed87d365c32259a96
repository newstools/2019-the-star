Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has dismissed claims that a certain community is being targeted in the fight against corruption. Addressing the media from Parliament Buildings on Monday, Keter questioned Deputy President’s knowledge on the Arror and Kimwarer dams scandal. “I have read today that the Treasury CS said the money in question is about Sh20 billion. Even if it was Sh 7 billion, it is not like Sh7 which you can buy bread with. It is a huge amount that can be used to construct 200kms of tarmac road,” Keter said. Keter has also questioned the high price of construction of dams. He has called upon the office of Auditor General to audit dam projects thoroughly before construction begins. “The amounts of money used for building dams in Kenya are very crazy. We need to audit these projects to understand what makes them so expensive and so lucrative to the extent of attracting more leaders as suppliers,” he said. The MP has said there is a need to scrutinise all projects properly in order to reduce the loss of public funds. At the same time, he lauded the handshake, saying it has united the country more than before. “We can only win the war of corruption and terrorism through unity. President Uhuru Kenyatta should go on with the spirit of the handshake. It has united Kenyans irrespective of religion,” Keter said. He said some individuals have benefited from stalled projects in the entire Rift Valley region.
