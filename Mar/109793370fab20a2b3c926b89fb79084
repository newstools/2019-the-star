Shabana coach Gilbert Selebwa has expressed his disappointment after his team dropped two points in their 1-1 draw against Nairobi Stima at Gusii Stadium. “This is a game we would have won. Our target is to have maximum points at home. We wasted two glorious chances in the second half but the boys played well,” he added after the game. He, however, hailed his charges since they are now on four-match unbeaten run. “The work we have put in place is now bearing fruits,” said the veteran coach. He also praised Nairobi Stima for their competitiveness. “They were worthy opponents who gave us a good game. They have very experienced players which came in handy for them in the second half,” added the coach. He praised winger Bob Mugalia saying his game has improved tremendously. “At the beginning of the season, he would not last the whole game but he has worked hard and I’m certain that, by second leg, he will return to where he belongs,” he added. Nairobi Stima’s George Owoko said: “It was a fairly balanced game and I’m happy since we have maintained our unbeaten record in the league so far. Shabana is a good team but we came here prepared to win the game. However, one point is better than nothing.” Owoko was also happy with the huge turnout of fans at Gusii Stadium. Hamisi Hadi gave Shabana the lead in the 33rd minute but Victor Omune scored Stima’s equaliser in the second half.
