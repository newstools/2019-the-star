President Uhuru Kenyatta has the choice to act on run-away corruption or let the country collapse under his watch, United Democratic Party leader Cyrus Jirongo has said. Jirongo said the President should stop threatening and instead act as the level of corruption is alarmingly high. He said it is embarrassing for Deputy President William Ruto to defend corruption. The DP on Thursday said media reports that the government had lost Sh21 billion in Arror and Kamwerer dams were misleading. He said only an expenditure of Sh7 billion was questionable. On the same day, President Kenyatta promised that high profile state officials implicated in corruption will be arrested and prosecuted. Yesterday, Jirongo said, “ It is either Uhuru acts now or we don’t have anything to call a country.” He added, “The Kenyatta family is respected and it will not go down well for the country to go down under his watch.” The opposition party leader asked the President to stamp his authority and ensure all the corrupt people in government are behind bars and that all the stolen assets are recovered. Jirongo said the rampant corruption is frustrating development, putting the President’s legacy under threat. He maintained that corruption is eroding the confidence of Kenyans in the government. “These graft issues are damaging the moral fabric of the country because our children are now starting to wonder why they are going to school when they can use shortcuts to become rich,” he said. ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi on Monday asked the President to sack ministers whose dockets are implicated in graft to allow for proper investigations into the scandals. Mudavadi said it is pointless to investigate individuals who are holding powerful state offices since they are likely to frustrate the investigation. He said the Uhuru-Raila handshake was of no use to Kenyans if looting continues as the President and the ODM leader watched.
