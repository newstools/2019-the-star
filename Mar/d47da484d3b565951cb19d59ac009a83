The Judicial Service Commission has started recruiting more than 40 judges and over 100 magistrates, Chief Justice David Maraga has said. To achieve speedy delivery of justice, Maraga said the new judicial officers will ease the backlog of cases. The Judiciary continues has a severe shortage of resources, both human and financial. In the Environment and Land Court, for instance, it’s impossible to get a hearing date this year as the court diary is full, the CJ said. The Court of Appeal has 19 Judges against the minimum of 30. “This shortage continues to hamper the effective disposal of cases,” Maraga said while launching the State of the Judiciary and Administration of Justice report. He said the backlog stands at 327,928 cases. Out of the 327,928 cases, 55 per cent are between one and three years old, 23 per cent between three and five years and 22 per cent, over five years. In the last two financial years, majority of the pending cases were in magistrates’ courts at 407,631 followed by the High Court at 92,327 cases.The least number of pending cases was in the supreme court at 95.
