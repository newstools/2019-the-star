Former Kenya Open champion Shufaa Changawa has been ruled out the Fed Cup team currently preparing for the tournament slated for next month in Montenegro. Changawa was locked out by a shoulder injury and will miss out on the event. Also missing from the squad is Sneha Kotecha who is playing in the Futures tournaments Tennis Kenya (TK) have named a provisional squad of five players including Judy Nkatha, Alice Owegi, Rosehilda Asumwa, Shanaya Gadaya and Radha Raja and the players have training for the past fortnight. Four players will be selected in the final team for the championship. Kenya are expected to face the hosts Montenegro, Uganda, Egypt, Morocco, Ireland, Madagascar and Norway with the top two teams gaining promotion to Group II. TK administrator, Sue Adhiambo, said Team Kenya will be seeking to improve on its performance at the event after poor results in the past two editions, where Kenya finished ninth out of 12 countries. Adhiambo said she expects the team to be competitive in the week long tournament, considering it comprises youthful players. “It’s a very young squad and they have been playing in various ITF tournaments. They will compete against the world’s best players and we hope we can improve on our performance from last season,” he added. The Nairobi Club where the team trains is identical to what the team will face in Montenegro which is clay court. “The training on the clay court will aid their preparation for the event,” added Adhiambo.

Okutoyi will be seeking to improve on her ranking and get an invite to play at the prestigious French Open, Wimbledon or US Open junior tournaments later in this year. Okutoyi is also slated to play in Tunisia and Morocco this month in build up tournament.
