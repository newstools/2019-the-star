Sixty students of St Brigid's Nangwe Girls were on Sunday night injured after lightning struck the school. The students were attending evening studies when the lightning struck following heavy rains in the region. School principal Francisca Munyasia told the Star that 50 students were treated at the Khalaba medical hospital and discharged while 10 are still admitted at the facility by are all in a stable condition. “The unfortunate incident occurred when the students were having evening remedial classes but we rushed in very fast and took charge to ensure they were treated as soon as possible,” she said. She said the facility lacks lightning arrestors and urged the ministry and the county to intervene and have them installed.
