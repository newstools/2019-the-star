Seven members of one family were among the 23 victims identified after an outbreak of tornadoes devastated the US state of Alabama, officials have said. Every victim, including four children, were found in close proximity to their homes, rescue crews say. The victims range in age from six to 89, Lee County Coroner Bill Harris told a news conference. Up to eight people remain missing, officials say, and there are fears that the death toll could rise. "We believe that every victim was in the residence when it hit. They all ended up, with the exception of two, outside the residence," Mr Harris told reporters, adding that their homes "aren't there". He added that one survivor lost seven members of his family, and warned that he may be facing "financial issues" because of multiple funeral costs. "They're going to have seven funerals that they have to finance somehow," he said, adding that donors have been reaching out to help the family with the expenses. The tornadoes struck eastern Alabama on Sunday, levelling homes and carving a path of at least a half mile (0.8km) wide in some parts of the state. Click here for the latest political news
