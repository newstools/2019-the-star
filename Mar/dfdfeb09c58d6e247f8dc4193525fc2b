Kenya Sevens forward Arthur Owira has accused the government for abandoning him at his hour need following injury sustained while serving the country at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia. Owira has been recuperating since last year’s Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast in Australia, where he suffered a horrific leg injury. Owira fractured his right femur—the main bone between the knee and hip. The rugby stalwart opened up on his recuperating process where he singled out his employers Kenya Commercial Bank, Kenya Rugby Union and his family for shouldering his medical bills since his return from Gold Coast. He said he wasn’t surprised by the government’s move to neglect him despite suffering the injury while representing the country in an international assignment. “It’s been tough for me but I thank my family, KCB and KRU for their aid in clearing my medical bills and physiotherapy programs,” he added. He, however, reckoned that he has been granted the green light to resume training in June. After being given the nod by the medics to recuperate from home, Owira was set to be out of action for at least six months but he revealed that his local physiotherapist has set June as his expected month to begin light training. “I am eager to start playing rugby again once the doctor clears me in June. He told me by June, I should be able to start training and I am looking forward to be back on the pitch again after one year out.” Owira has been recuperating since last year’s Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast in Australia, where he suffered a horrific leg injury. “The team is good and has young players, most of whom are making their first appearances in the series. “I think it’s good to be patient with them and accord them the required support. I believe they will turn around fortunes in the remaining legs and evade relegation at long last.”
