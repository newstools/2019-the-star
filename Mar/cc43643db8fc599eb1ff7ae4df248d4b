The Sh167 million allocated for the development of miraa farming in Embu is not enough, an MP said on Tuesday. Mbeere North MP Muriuki Njagagua yesterday said farmers were disappointed with the allocation out of the Sh1.2 billion set aside by the national government. Njagagua said they need more funds to drill enough boreholes, construct dams, build markets stalls and train farmers. “The money is not enough and we shall push for more,” said Njagagua told the Star on the phone. The MP said many farmers need proper business management skills and opening of more markets after the EU banned miraa exports. “We however appreciate the cash because it will play a substantial role in the development of the crop and farmers’ welfare,” he said. He said farmers appreciated efforts being made to improve miraa farming. “Initially, there was nothing from the government but we’re beginning to see a positive change.” Meru got the lion’s share of the cash with an allocation of Sh670 million. Tharaka Nithi got Sh41.9 million. Embu plans to drill two boreholes at Evutoka Primary school and Ndagoma Catholic in Mbeere North. Mbeere South will have three boreholes drilled at Kamuguchu, Murindi and Nyweri. The money will also be used to build six market shades in Embu town, Kwanjara, Muraru, Kiritiri, Siakago and Gatituri.
