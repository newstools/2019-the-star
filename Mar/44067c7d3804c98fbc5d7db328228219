The national government wants more than 145 households in Gwassi Forest in Suba South to vacate to protect the forest catchment area. The government announced on Thursday that it will evict them should they fail to move out in five months. They will not be compensated because they occupy preserved public land, more than 500 hectares, officials said. Homa Bay ecosystem conservator Mathews Ogutu and commissioner Irungu Macharia said a notice had been issued to the families. Speaking to journalists after their monthly meeting in Homa Bay on Thursday, Ogutu argued that the families have encroached on government preserved land. He said protecting the Gwassi Hills will promote environmental conservation. “There is a clear demarcation between private and forested lands. We expect the families to abide by the law and leave the forested areas in time to avoid eviction,” Ogutu said. Gwassi Forest covers 4,835 hectares. It is a water catchment area, like other areas in Homa Bay like Lambwe, Wire, Homa Hills and Kodera Forest. “The ejection process will be systematic and orderly to avoid conflict or damage of property,” Ogutu said. Macharia said settlement in the forest promotes soil erosion which causes floods in the lower areas of Suba South. Gwassi Forest is on a steep hill and when people cultivate farms, the topsoil is eroded and slides to lower areas, the conservator said. “This promotes flooding and mudslides that cause deaths and property damage in the lower forest,” he said. The government official said restoration will enable people living in lower areas to get water from rivers whose sources are in Gwassi. “We plan to plant more than 100,000 trees in the county’s different forests in the ongoing rainy season,” Ogutu said. In 2012, then acting head of forest conservation Wilson Kiplagat said 2,700 hectares were illegally occupied. He said logging, charcoal burning and bhang growing had been initiated before 300 families were flushed out earlier by forest guards.
