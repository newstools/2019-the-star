Strathmore University Scorpions coach Meshack Senge is confident of bringing to an end Telkom’s dominance as the 2019 Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) season kicks off  this weekend. Scorpions, who start their campaign against Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology tomorrow at City Park in the Premier League, have played second fiddle to the record champions and Senge is hopeful that fortunes will swing their way this season. The experienced coach banks his hopes on the preparations his girls have had during pre-season where he noted the costly mistakes committed in the previous seasons were addressed and all loopholes sealed. He singled out tough luck in their matches against Telkom which have always turned to be the title deciding duels as their undoing but expressed confidence in her players in neutralizing their fierce rivals this season. “Going by the preparations we have had I strongly believe this is our season to win the league. We have been playing well but we have always been unlucky against Telkom in both legs and ended up being runners up,” said Senge. “This season things will be different as we have addressed that in the preseason and I believe my girls have come of age and will be able to floor Telkom. But we have to begin the season with a win against JKUAT and maintain a winning culture.” Today, in the national men’s league Gorilla tackle Mount Kenya University before Thika Rovers accost Karate Axiom as JKUAT Men  face  off with Parkroad Tigers.
