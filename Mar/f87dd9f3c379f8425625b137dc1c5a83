Opposition leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday protested against foreign engineers being awarded jobs that can be done by Kenyans. The AU Envoy for Infrastructure said the government must create both jobs and business opportunities for local engineers so that the country’s economy can grow effectively. The NASA leader spoke at his Capitol Hill office after meeting with engineers who had paid him a courtesy call. He agreed to forward the engineers' petition to President Uhuru Kenyatta so that their issues are looked into.

As a result, all multinationals are running there for good and cheap services.” “I also call on engineers to reorganise themselves and weed out the corrupt so that Kenyans get value for their money,” Raila said. The Institute of Engineers of Kenya Secretary General Nathaniel Matalanga said investment in the engineering sector is vital to economic growth. “We want the government to realign the education sector and invest in engineering courses to create jobs and build our economy,” he said.
