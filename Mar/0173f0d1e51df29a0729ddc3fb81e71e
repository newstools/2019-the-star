From the theatre to running a university, Knec chairman George Magoha will be at the helm of Jogoo House if MPs approve his nomination as Education CS. The trained surgeon turned administrator carries the hopes of dissecting issues ailing the education sector. His combative and firm demeanor has seen him take grip administration when things are sour and earned him the nickname ‘Buffalo’ while serving as University of Nairobi vice-chancellor between 2005 and 2015. With about 27 per cent allocation of the national budget - more than what any county receives - Education remains one of the government’s sensitive ministries. Magoha’s appointment comes as his term at the examination council nears its end. At the helm of Knec, Magoha teamed up with the ministers to clean up the national exams which had been dented with rampant cheating. On Friday, stakeholders praised Magoha for his nomination to head the ministry. Kenya National Union of Teachers secretary general Wilson Sossion asked Magoha to quickly adjust to his new job. National Parents Association and school heads called on Parliament to approve his nomination. Unions said they expect a cordial working relationship with the new education boss. Secondary School Heads Association chairman Indimuli Kahi said they hope Magoha will deal with emerging challenges. From poor funding that threatens free primary education to congested secondary schools following the 100 per cent transition and the ailing quality standards in universities, Magoha’s plate is more than full.
