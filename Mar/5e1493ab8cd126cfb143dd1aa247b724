Siaya MCAs have cautioned Governor Cornel Rasanga against stopping projects in their wards because traders have failed to pay taxes. The ward representatives said the problem was due to poor services by the county government. Rasanga had directed the Trade and Finance executive to stop implementation of projects in Central Alego and West Asembo wards. He accused MCAs Leonard Oriaro (Central Alego) and Ambrose Akuno (West Asembo) of inciting traders to stop paying taxes. The traders in Central Alego and West Asembo markets stopped paying fees over what they said was uncollected garbage, poor drainage, lack of toilets and security lights. Sigomere MCA Erick Odawa on Wednesday said the governor’s move amounts to segregation of residents. The MCAs warned Rasanga not to dare them, saying they will boycott paying taxes in all the 30 wards. “Services are a right, not a privilege. The Executive must ensure services are rendered to all Siaya residents without imposing unnecessary conditions,” Odawa said. He told the executive to clearly show how it has spent taxes and fees levied on residents since 2013. Majority chief whip and West Uyoma MCA Samuel Olasi said taxes collected and levies imposed on traders should be commensurate to services provided by the county.
