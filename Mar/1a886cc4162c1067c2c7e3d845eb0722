A hospital has accused a patient who sued it for unlawful detention of dishonesty and thanklessness. Nairobi Women’s Hospital yesterday said Emma Njeri was in poor condition when it admitted her last year. Staff worked tirelessly to get her out of the ICU and her claims of mistreatment amounted to thanklessness, the hospital said in an affidavit. “Before the admission, the petitioner had been denied admission to several other hospitals on account of deposit and appropriate facilities,” it says. “It’s dishonest and thankless on the part of petitioner to later allege mistreatment.” The hospital’s management asked the court to dismiss the suit and order Njeri to pay Sh2.7 million outstanding bill. The hospital was replying to a suit filed by Njeri accusing it of detaining her over Sh4 million bill. Njeri was admitted to the hospital after she suffered a stroke and was discharged on May 14. At the time of her discharge, the bill was Sh3.1 million. She paid Sh1.3 million and offered a proposal to settle the balance, which the hospital rejected. She was then detained, according the claims in the suit papers. Njeri said the detention caused her to incur daily charges of Sh5,000, making the bill to skyrocket. “The hospital continues to levy the petitioner a daily charge of Sh5,000, while she is not receiving any treatment as she was discharged on May 14, 2018,” the papers say. Njeri said she was unable to participate in the upbringing of her one-year-old son because of the detention. She asked the court to order her immediate release. She also asked for orders for compensation for unlawful detention and loss of earnings, occasioned by “false imprisonment”. The hospital said the woman always assured she would pay the bill in full during her treatment. It said it has a right to compensation for services rendered and that Njeri should be orderd to settle her outstanding bill.
