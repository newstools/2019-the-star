The Kenya Private Sector Alliance has condemned the ongoing strike by Kenya Aviation Workers Union (KAWU) saying it is uncalled for and has affected business across the region. “This strike is very premature as the two institutions have said time and again that no one will lose their jobs and we do not know why they had to call the strike at this very early age,” said Carole Kariuki CEO of Kepsa, adding that the issues at hand have yet to be agreed on. She was speaking when she opened the first annual Women In Human Resource convention organised by Institute of Human Resource Management at Lake Naivasha Resort. She said women continue to face challenges in their work stations with many marginalised, stagnating in one job group. “Women have fewer opportunities compared to their male colleagues and this is not just locally but globally. Something should be done to help them access the benefits just like their counterparts,” she said. IHRM executive director Dorcas Wainaina said there are disparities in remuneration for women in the profession. “Even as we celebrate the International Women’s Day, we need to look at the challenges women face and see how to deal with them.”
