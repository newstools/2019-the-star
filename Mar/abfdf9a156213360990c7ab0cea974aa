Kenyans adopted devolution without re-looking at the national policy dealing with critical sectors, Senate Majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen said yesterday. The Elgeyo Marakwet senator said though there is a law that looks into matters of health, the guiding policy at the national level needs to be re-examined. He called for a participatory policy framework. He spoke at the Sixth Annual Devolution Conference at Kirinyaga University. Health is a devolved function, with the national government having policy roles. Universal healthcare is one of the pillars of the government’s Big Four Agenda. Murkomen said the new policy to be developed should define the levels of hospitals. It should define what is a referral hospital, the function of the county government, the resources that will remain with the national government and those that will be in the county governments. Proper guidelines should also define the implementers to ensure results are achievable and measurable. “We also have a big problem in the agriculture sector. And although we blame the counties that they must deliver on the agriculture function, the reality is that the policy framework we are using as a nation is the old one used before devolution,” he said. The lawmaker called for a clear policy that will guide the counties and the national government on their roles, especially on farm input, extension services, and disease prevention, among others. He urged the Devolution ministry to convene a meeting to look into the issues to end the blame game between the two levels of government.
