Rugby Sevens powerhouse Chavakali have been pitted against arch-rivals Vihiga High, Esalwa, Kaptik and Essong’olo in Pool ‘A’ ahead of the Vihiga County Secondary Schools Term One games that get underway tomorrow. The event, which ends on Saturday will see Nyangori top Pool ‘B’ alongside Ebulonga, Ematsuli, Kivagala and Masana. In rugby 15s, Vihiga High are in Pool ‘A’ alongside Hobunaka, Nyang’ori, Busali Union and Emusire while Group ‘B’ comprise Mbale, Ebusiloli, Kaimosi, Kegoye and Ekwanda. The winners will win a ticket to represent the county in the western regional championship that will be held in Vihiga later this month. Chavakali, who won silver during East African Championship in Rwanda last year after losing to Laiser Hill, will be using the event to assess their new acquisitions and fitness levels of the team. “We will be going into the championship as favourites but we will leave nothing to chance. We know other teams have equally prepared well and so it’s going to be very tough for us right from the group stage but we are ready and will be taking each match at a time,” said coach Peter Simwa. Simwa said they expect a lot of pressure considering they are the event’s hosts. “The boys will be subjected to a lot of pressure as a result of being hosts but I want to challenge them to take it in a positive way and fight for the school as we target to win both national and East African Championship titles,” Simwa revealed. Simwa, however, warned his players not to be complacent ahead of the championship but rather remain focused and treat each game as a final to achieve their dream of returning to the East Africa stage.
