Sugar farmers want government to form a committee to regulate sugar importation in the country. Ibrahim Juma, the Kenya National Federation of Sugarcane chairman said the government should form a committee comprising of farmers to monitor importation into the country. Juma said the sugar industry is in dire need of urgent attention in order to address the plight of farmers. “There are people out to frustrate the government’s efforts to revive the sugar industry and thus want to ensure their market space is not interrupted. They import huge supplies into the country and thus contribute to the dismal performance of the local industry and more so worsen the plight of the small scale farmers,” he said. The farmers also want the sugar tribunal committee revived to help in hearing cases regarding farmers and mills as court cases take years to tackle. According to the 2018 Economic Survey, Kenya imported more sugar than it produced in 2017 when production was at its lowest. Kenya imports almost tripled to 989,600 tonnes in 2017, compared with 376,100 tonnes in 2016. The total domestic sugar production declined by 41.2 per cent from 639, 700 tonnes in 2016, to 376100 tonnes in 2017. The same year, the area under cane reduced to 191,200 hectares, compared with 220,800 hectares in 2016. Juma said with proper regulations, excessive importation, poaching and poor payment will be tamed. “Sugarcane farmers are yet to be paid Sh2.6 billion as the president directed during Jamhuri day celebration. Farmers from Mumias have waited for their money for 24 months,” he said. The company owes farmers Sh1.2 billion. He said regulations should be put in place and farmers paid their dues.
