KRA Commissioner General John Njiraini has been accused of misusing his position and public resources to acquire a majority stake in a décor firm. Court documents seen by the Star indicate that he is using KRA to demand Sh332.43 million in taxes from Space and Style limited. Businessman Njama Wambugu, the director of Space and Style limited yesterday moved to court seeking a conservatory order to bar KRA from taking over his companies. Through a petition filed by his lawyer Nelson Havi, Wambugu reveals that Njiraini is a shareholder in the building solutions firm. “His interests in the company are owned through an offshore firm Decamis Limited registered in Hong Kong,” the documents read in part. According to Wambugu, Njirani who is the KRA boss is using the state agency to frustrate his fellow shareholders by initiating partial tax inquiries against the company. KRA is demanding Sh61.79 million from Njama Wambugu, Sh140.03 million from Roser Roofing, East Africa, Sh122.56 million from One Health care, Sh6.55 million from Trade line Express ( Kenya) limited and Sh1.46 million from Citigates Developers limited. “The state office is initiating sporadic adhoc demands on the petitioners with a calculated exclusion of space and Style limited with the aim of frustrating the petitioners,” the petitioner said. The documents further reveal a current fallout between Wambugu, Njiraini and a third shareholder, Winfred Wanjiku Ngumi on the ownership of the firm. This was after Wanjiku attempted to get majority control of the firm without paying an agreed transfer fee of Sh225 million that would see Ngumi sell some of his shares to her. The fallout saw High court restrain Wanjiku in January from holding herself out as the majority shareholder of Space and Style limited on account of fraudulently transfered shares.
