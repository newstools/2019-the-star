Kenya Commercial Bank volleyball team setter Salome Wanjala, right attacker Nancy Mulonza and middle blocker Pauline Nyongesa are the surprise exclusion from the 14-member squad that depart to Cairo, Egypt tonight for the African Club Championship. Also axed are recovered Phoscah Kasisi and Linet Mukambi. The three were instrumental for the bankers as they settled for second position during the last year’s Kenya Volleyball Federation league play-off—a position that earned them a slot to the annual event. But it was Wanjala’s exploits that saw KCB overpower former champion Kenya Pipeline to finish second ahead of eventual winners Kenya Prisons. In their place, KCB technical bench has drafted in new signing including Joan Muindi from Pipeline and team captain Gladys Wairimu to do duties. Interestingly, all the six players KCB acquired from Pipeline have all made the it to the final squad including hard hitting Noel Murambi, left handed Violet Makuto, utility player Leonida Kasaya, upcoming Jemimah Siangu, Truphosa Samoei and Christine Njambi. Others, who have made the cut are— Milgreen Lituva, Metrine Nabwire, Eglay Kuloba, Lincy Jeruto, Doreen Marani and Modesta Chepchirchir. A source privy to the new development said questioned the criteria used in selection of the final list, describing it as suspect. “We will just have to wait and see. Some players have moved positions and it will be interesting to see how they perform in their new roles. Generally, some of the picks are very questionable,” revealed the source. The source said, KCB who are returning to the African bonanza set for March 16-25 after featuring last in 2015, have been given tough target. “They have been told it’s a podium finish or nothing. Therefor, the pressure is on and it will be interesting to see how the team performs and what the end results will be when the event folds up.” Japheth Munala and David Kinga will guide the team in the nine-day event.
