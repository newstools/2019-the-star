KCB fullback Darwin Mukidza has been ruled out for the rest of season after undergoing surgery. The Kenya Simbas vice-captain will now miss the final two games of the season against Quins and Homeboyz as well as the playoffs and final matches for the bankers. Mukidza has been an integral player for the side that won the past two Kenya Cup titles and is expected to be back in time for the start of the international season for the Kenya Simbas. Speaking yesterday, KCB team-manager said Mukidza underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and they expect him to make a full recovery in the next three months. "He got injured in our match against Kabras and he went for surgery last week. He should be fit by the time the Kenya Simbas play test matches and he will play for us in July during the National sevens circuit,” added Wamae. Wamae added that hooker George Asin and centre Elphas Otieno have been ruled out for the remainder of the season with knee injuries. Wamae was optimistic about the side depth and chances for the remainder of the season. "We are taking it one game at a time. We are in a rich vein of form having scored bonus points in our last couple of games and we hope to continue that way until the playoffs and finals,” added Wamae. The bankers have lost only once this season, going down 27-22 to Nondies in November and seeing their 20-month unbeaten run ended. Wamae said it was a wake-up call for the team. "The boys have recovered well from that setback and the results are there for everyone to see. We will keep pushing and ensure we retain the title,” added Wamae. KCB are joint top with Kabras on 64 points and are on course to host the semifinals next month.
