Shujaa received a major boost ahead of the Vancouver Sevens this weekend as half back Johnstone Olindi linked up with the squad. Olindi left the country on Sunday evening and linked up with the rest of the squad who had flown in from Las Vegas, where Kenya bagged five points. Olindi missed the Las Vegas tournament over the weekend due to a visa hitch. The former Upper Hill student, who has been standout player for the squad, is currently third in the team’s top point scorers list this season with a total of 64 points having scored 10 tries and seven conversions. Vincent Onyala and Daniel Taabu top the list with 77 and 70 points respectively heading into the Vancouver leg. Captain Jacob Ojee is fourth on the Kenyan log with 40 points (8 tries) while Cyprian Kuto is fifth with 35 points. Head coach Paul Murunga has expressed delight with Olindi arrival in the team ahead of this weekend’s event in Vancouver. “He is one of our best players on the circuit and his ability to unlock defences and create tries for his team-mates will be vital in the tournament over the weekend Murunga said the young side is steadily improving and he is confident that with five tournaments remaining, they can at least make two Main Cup quarters. “I’m confident we will not be relegated. The boys are making steady improvements and moving up the log,” he added. Skipper Jacob Ojee said the team has nothing to fear in playing Samoa and Fiji in Vancouver in their two opening fixtures. “They are two very good teams but if we take our chances and defend well, we have a chance of winning,” added Ojee. Kenya and Fiji have met twice this season with the Olympic champions winning both encounters with big margins 38-7 in Cape Town and 43-12 in Dubai. Kenya and Samoa are to meet this season. Shujaa kickoff their campaign against 8:36pm against Fiji before taking on Samoa at 12:30am and completing their Day 1 action against hosts Canada at 3:40am.
