Nurses have threatened to strike again to protest against the Council of Governors's proposal to employ them on a contract basis. Through the National Union of Nurses and Cotu, the health workers have promised to paralyse the sector if the moved is not reversed. KNUN Secretary General Seith Panyako said his members are ready to react if the proposal was endorsed. He accused the COG of discriminating them noting that just like other workers they were entitled to good remuneration and working conditions. “From the start, we were opposed to the move to devolve health and this is now evident with some governors planning to oppress health workers and we shall not allow this,” he said. Panyako pointed an accusing finger at CoG chairman Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega) and Mwangi wa Iria (Murang’a) for the proposal to employ the workers on contract. “We are aware of plans by the two governors who have formed a company to hire and lease out nurses to counties and other institutions and their plans will fail,” he said.

Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli said they were opposed to casualization of labour. Speaking in Naivasha on Tuesday, Atwoli termed the proposal as laughable adding that it would not be implemented as it was against the constitution. “We have heard about the plans to employ health workers by counties on contract and we shall definitely oppose this ill-advised plan,” he said.
