According to police sources, the CS is set to give clarification on the Arror and Kimwarer dams saga that has rocked the country in the past few weeks. This is the second time the CS has appeared before the DCI. He had earlier recorded a statement over the same matter. Rotich is accompanied by his lawyer Katwa Kigen. Last week, the CS said the advance payment made to the contractor of the two dams was done within the law.
