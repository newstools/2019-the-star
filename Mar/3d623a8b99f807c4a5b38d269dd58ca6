Yesterday Finance CS Henry Rotich told the Star that government now intends to import Sh2 billion subsidised fertiliser for Kenyan farmers. Last month Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri confirmed that government would not be importing subsidised fertiliser this year but hoped to introduce an e-voucher system next year for farmers to get subsidised fertiliser. It is a pity that Rotich succumbed to pressure from Rift Valley farmers. He was in the right. He should have stuck to his principles. Subsidised fertiliser only benefits a narrow section of farmers. It is very difficult to distribute it equitably. The importer may also pocket some of the subsidies and not pass the full value to the farmer. The government was right to try and cut back on such a wasteful and inefficient subsidy. Nevertheless, if the government is going to spend Sh2 billion on subsidised fertiliser, let it be through the e-voucher scheme proposed by Kiunjuri. Only verified farmers should receive the e-vouchers. That way at least we can be confident that the money is going to the farmer and not to a middleman or trader.
