Residents of Kilingili in Vihiga woke up to a rude shock on Sunday morning when they found five bodies of security guards at the market. The watchmen who guarded shops and other business premises at Kilingili market were slashed to death. The motive of the killing remains unknown since nothing was stolen from the shops. Residents blocked the police from taking the bodies to Mbale mortuary in protest over rising insecurity in the area. One resident Elisha Alela said the killers appear to be a well-organised gang. "If they wanted to steal, they did not need to kill harmless, unarmed watchmen," he said. Last month, another watchman was killed by unknown attackers in the same area who drove away a lorry loaded with household goods. The lorry was recovered in the neighbouring Siaya county. Residents are demanding answers, they want to know how the killings happened yet there a police station is in the vicinity. The killing occurred a stone's throw away from Kilingili police station. A high profile security meeting was in progress by the time of going to press. Kilingili residents vowed that the bodies will not be removed by the police until there is a clear picture of what transpired. The bodies of the elderly watchmen have multiple deep cuts on several parts of their bodies. Click here for the latest political news
