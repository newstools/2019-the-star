Water and Energy Solutions firm Davis & Shirtliff has announced plans to open new branches in the country with the aim of covering 70 per cent of the counties by the end of the year. According to the company’s chief executive officer David Gatende, the plan is already underway with the year having started with the opening of four new branches in Githurai, Marsabit, Nyeri and Kitale. He added that expansion into the counties is a key priority for Davis & Shirtliff adding that they plan to have a presence in every Kenyan county within the next three years. “Devolution has had a dramatic and positive effect on the lives of Kenyans, and its importance cannot be over emphasized. Its effects are not just limited to the public sector and we in the private sector have also had to devolve in our own ways to keep up with the public sector,” Gatende said. The firm conducted an analysis across the country to establish areas where water and energy solutions are urgently required. Currently the firm has 37 branches in 26 counties representing 55 per cent county presence with the newly opened branches raising the number of branches in the country to 40. The firm applies alternative solutions such as solar, and water saving solutions to reach consumers with ease in Kenya.
