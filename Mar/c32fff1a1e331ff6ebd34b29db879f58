The Bungoma senator expressed alarm over the increase in the number of lightning strikes that cause injuries to schoolchildren. He said installation is urgent since the long rains have already begun. “It’s sad that cases of lightning strikes in schools are now rampant in rainy seasons. It’s the ministry’s responsibility to ensure children are safe in the institutions,” Wetang’ula said. Lightning arresters should also be installed in private schools, he said. He urged county leaders to install arresters in other public places such as markets and health facilities.  get well soon On Sunday, 65 students of St Brigid Nangwe Girls’ High School, Bungoma, were injured after lightning struck the school. Some students were admitted to hospital, others were treated and discharged. “I assure the school administration of my full suppor during these hard times as we pray for the students’ quick recovery,” Wetang’ula said. Bungoma Woman Representative Catherine Wambilianga promised to engage other parties to ensure the lightning arresters are installed. “It’s quite unfortunate such a huge number of students got injured yet this is something we can control,” she said. “My office will work with the county government to ensure cases of people being struck by becomes history.”
