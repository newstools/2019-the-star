Matatu workers want to be involved in the implementation process of the Bus Rapid Transit System. Transport Workers Union held a procession from their office in Nacico Plaza on Landhies Road to the Ministry of Transport to present a petition to the Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia. TAWU secretary general Dan Mihadi said workers have been locked out of meetings and deliberations on the implementation of the BRT System. “They have Matatu Owners Association on board but not us, the people who work on a day to day basis. We are the ones with the technical knowledge of the day to day running of the Industry, we should be included,” Mihadi said. He said if implementation was not well coordinated to include public transport workers in such a massive stage, it would not be devoid of controversy. Kenya is implementing an integrated transport system whereby the country will use trains and the BRT system. The move is aimed at decongesting Nairobi City and facilitates easy movement of passengers. The Ministry of Transport has already finalized the purchase of the first batch of 64 BRT buses to be used for the pilot scheme and they are ready for shipping from South Africa, with negotiations ongoing to procure 11 diesel trains from Spain.
