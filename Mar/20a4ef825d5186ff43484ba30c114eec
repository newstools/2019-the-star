Three Kenyans judokas have booked early tickets to the 12th All Africa Games set for between August 23 and September 3 in Rabat, Morocco. Cadet Nasongo Muchai, junior duo of Kimberley Ombisi and Elizabeth Raremi have qualified to represent Kenya at the continental sports extravaganza. Though none of them brought Kenya gold medal from the just concluded Africa Youth and Cadet Judo Championships staged in Bujumbura, Burundi, their podium positions earned them berths to the African governments-sponsored sports carnival. Cadet Muchai won a silver medal in his category, whereas the junior judokas settled for silver. Shadrack Maluki, the Kenya Judo Association president, said they will immediately embark on a training programme ahead of the games. “We have limited time with them. They are all school going children so we have to work closely with their parents and schools to ensure they get the best training regime ahead of the All Africa Games,” said Maluki. He also noted that this was the best performance ever in the last two decades for Kenya in the continental Cadet and Junior Championships. “This is not limited to the medalists only, the level of competition amongst our youths has improved tremendously,” added Maluki, a former Judo Olympian. Meanwhile, senior judokas have two steps to go through if they are to qualify for the Rabat Games. This weekend, they head to Menengai Social Hall in Nakuru County where KJA will select nine judokas to be entered in the final round of qualification at the East Africa Seniors Qualification set for March 13 in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania.
