Homeboyz Ladies coach Mary Muiseka has expressed confidence that her charges will win the women’s festival. Musieka saw her side beat Nakuru 15-5 in the final on Sunday to move within two points of Impala on the standings. “It’s a very competitive event. We have seen three different winners so far and this shows every team has stepped up and it makes the game interesting,” added Musieka. She said there is room for improvement for her charges as they approach the end of series. “We have three rounds remaining before we wrap up the series and we have work to do especially on our ball retention and execution in defence. Our attack also needs to be refined,” added Musieka. Nakuru won the opening tournament at Kenyatta University with Impala winning the second at KCB Sports Club. Impala lead the standings after three tournaments with 58 points with Homeboyz second on 56 points. Nakuru are third on 55 points.
