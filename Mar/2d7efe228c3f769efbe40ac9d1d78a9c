Digital sales firm Ad Dynamo has expanded its Africa operations after opening a Nairobi office to root presence in East Africa. The firm is in charge of representing social media giants Twitter and Snapchat, as well as Spotify and Verizon Media in Africa, having operated in Kenya for the past five years but with no physical office according to Adrian Ciesielski, the Kenya country manager. They are looking to secure more business from within the continent through pushing business for brands such as Twitter. "Twitter sees a huge opportunity in Africa and is an important element of our growth strategy and we are seeing sustained momentum from across the continent, both in terms of usage and revenue," said Barry Collins, senior director of Twitter Client Solutions EMEA. Kenya is home to one of the most active audiences on Twitter in Africa, whose user base takes to Twitter in a unique blend of wit, humour and conversation characterised with local phenomenons such as the weekly discussions by Kenyans on Twitter or #KOT.
