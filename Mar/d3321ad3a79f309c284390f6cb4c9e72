Nairobi’s Globe Roundabout should be a holding ground for matatus to decongest the CBD, a transport lobby has told court. The National Confederation Matatu Transporters told Justice James Makau it is exploring an out-of-court settlement with City Hall, and has submitted its proposals and consultations are underway. Businessman Paul Kobia and the confederation challenged Governor Mike Sonko’s ban on matatus in downtown in court last year. Justice Wilfrida Okwany suspended the ban. The NCMT says the roundabout should be improved to accommodate many vehicles. A parking lot can be built around Kirinyaga road, it says. “The parking created will be for both long- and short-distance vehicles,” it said. “But there is also need to invest in modern communication technology like setting up of a command centre complete with radio calls to supplement the efforts of the Traffic police in ensuring smooth flow of traffic.” The NCMT says congestion is not City Hall’s fault and blames it on “the tremendous increase of the urban population and the increase in demand for public transport services”. It wants double parking stopped and underused lanes repaired and used by town service vehicles only.
