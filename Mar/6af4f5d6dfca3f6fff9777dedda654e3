Parliament’s failure to pass the two-thirds Gender Bill could deal a blow to the anticipated referendum. Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana on Wednesday said women might gang up against constitutional amendments after their demands were rejected. Only 174 of the required 233 members were in the House. The bill flopped the fourth time. “It’ll be very hard to tell the same women you failed to support to vote for changing the Constitution if the law they want passed won’t be part of the amendments. I’m afraid the referendum will not sail through,” he said. The constitutional lawyer said the Bill would ensure fairness in political parties, adding that women are discriminated against during nominations and face hurdles during campaigns. He urged women to take their MPs to task and establish whether they were in the House when the bill flopped for lack of quorum. “Tell those who didn’t show up to forget your vote in the next election.” He spoke in Kalamba village, Kibwezi, during the burial of Lucy Kasiva, the mother of his press director Eduard Kyungu. “Had the bill progressed to become law, it would have bridged the gender gap in the legislative houses from county assemblies to the Senate and addressed the problems women have that we, as men, may not know.” County assembly speaker Douglas Mbilu blamed President Uhuru Kenyatta, ODM leader Raila Odinga and Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka for failing to mobilise MPs.
