Tension is high at Kaptoroi village in Nandi central after residents raided Prophet David Owuor's Repentance and Holiness Ministry and expelled worshippers. The more than 100 villagers invaded the church and forced worshipers to flee accusing it of breaking families. Kaptoroi residents armed with crude weapons invaded Kaptoroi church of the Repentance and Holiness Ministry and forced worshippers to end the service and leave the venue. The church run by self-declared Prophet Owuor was accused of misleading the congregations and “radicalisation” of Christians. The protesters claimed women had become a soft target for the church’s teaching, promoting separation for families if both don’t go to the same church. The church was subsequently locked and worshippers from the area were asked to join other denominations. Sylvester Tarus who led the protest ovowed to close down all the places of worship belonging to the church. “You’ll never find a member of the church tilling the land or harvesting tea. They only concentrate on their church, as a result, the economic fortunes have dwindled,” Tarus said. He said some have had children drop out of school. But they always get money to buy their church uniforms and cannot get school fees. The residents said a half of women in the area had abandoned their husbands. However, church officials said they had accepted to leave peacefully but promised to congregate next Sunday. “We have broken no law for anyone to subject us into this kind of ridicule,” a church official said. He requested not to be named, vowing that the church will grow stronger and have more people. “Why are we being persecuted by villagers who don’t recognize the existence of God?” he said. The residents said they were using a powerful public address system mounted on top of the church which played music 24 hours for the whole of last month.
