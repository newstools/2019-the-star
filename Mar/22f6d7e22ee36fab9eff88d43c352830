The National Army Museum in the UK, has agreed to return to Ethiopia a lock of hair belonging to Emperor Tewodros II, after more than 150 years. Emperor Tewodros committed suicide rather than surrender to British forces at the battle of Maqdala in 1868. The British ransacked the emperor's fortress, deploying dozens of mules and camels to carry off treasure. Ethiopia has been campaigning to have the artefacts returned. They also want the remains of Emperor Tewodros's son, Alemayehu, returned from Windsor castle to Ethiopia. Click here for the latest political news
