The government’s plan to distribute literature books to secondary school students is uncertain as a deal to commence printing has not been signed. The delay threatens affective syllabus delivery, forcing some principals to ask parents to buy the set books. In December, the Education ministry sent a circular to principals announcing it will extend distribution of books to include literature set books. The plan targeted 1.4 million learners in forms three and four. The purchase and distribution was expected to begin in January. But Kenya Publishers Association chairman Lawrence Njagi yesterday confirmed they are yet to get a nod from the ministry. “Students have only eight months left before they sit the KCSE examination. Some students have completely refused to purchase the set books because they think principals are maliciously trying to make them buy the books while they sit on monies given for the books,” Njagi told the Star. Kenyan education system requires students to take up literature in Form Three. That entails studying three English and three Swahili literature books which are examined in KCSE. Parents have been buying the set books. “The deal was good for those from a poor background. Some students only read set books in class where they share with their fellow students because they can’t afford,” Kenya Parents Association chair Nicholas Maiyo told the Star. The textbook policy introduced last year mandates the Ministry of Education to buy and distribute textbooks.
