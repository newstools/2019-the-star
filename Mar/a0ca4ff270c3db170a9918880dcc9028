The High Court in Eldoret has stopped Uasin Gishu county from putting up a Sh100 million administration block on disputed land at Cheptiret market. Justice Antony Obwayo of the Lands and Environment Court issued the orders after residents complained they had not been consulted on the project location. They argued that there had been no public participation before the project was started. Justice Ombwayo agreed that public participation was not done before the project was started as the Constitution requires. “Since there was no public participation in the implementation of the project, I hereby direct that the ongoing construction of the office blocks in Cheptiret be stopped with immediate effect until the matter before court is heard and determined,” the judge ruled. A contractor had already moved to the site and started work but residents filed a suit through their lawyer Stanley Kagunza, to halt the construction. They accused the county of overlooking them. Chairman of the residents group Kimutai Kirui said in court papers that the law must be adhered to in concern of public participation on such projects.
