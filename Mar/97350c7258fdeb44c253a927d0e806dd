Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang’ula has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to be tough and fearless.
“President Uhuru, you shouldn’t be intimidated by anyone, arrest them, even if they are your brothers. You have my full support,” he said.
Wetang’ula spoke during the burial of former Lwandanyi MCA Nathan Obwana in Kabkara village in Sirisia constituency on Saturday,
We don’t want to see suspects roaming freely yet the country is losing billions. They should be arrested and face the law, he said.
The Bungoma Senator also supported a change in the Constitution to the Parliamentary system where ministers are appointed among the elected MPs.
“We can’t have somebody elected with over eight million votes roaming in the streets, every vote should count,” he said.
The legislator also called on Bungoma residents to turn up in large numbers for the next census so the county can have more numbers to attract funding for development projects.
“Let’s turn out in large numbers, don’t leave out even mad people,” he said.
