MPs have summoned Environment CS Keriako Tobiko and Nema in probe into firms releasing effluent into rivers. The call by the National Assembly's Environment Committee came amid investigations into allegations of pollution of River Kibos by Kibos Sugar Company. The firm closed two plants following an order by Nema, a situation the lawmakers said was counterproductive as workers attached to the firm will lose jobs. The Kareke Mbiuki-led committee wants the Tobiko and the National Environmental Management Authority to explain measures they have taken to end the pollution. The matter was brought to the attention of the committee by Kisumu Woman Representative Rosa Buyu. The lawmaker asked the members to conduct a site visit at the milling company to collect facts that would be used to make a decision on the matter. “We must not punish investors and end up compromising people’s income unjustifiably,” Buyu said. Mbiuki instructed Nema to visit the company and furnish the committee with a report of its findings next week. Mumias East MP Ben Washiali said investors must ensure they adhere to environmental laws so that they don’t put lives at risk. Citing the case of London Distillers which had similar challenges, he questioned whether Nema was keen on ensuring firms comply with the Act. “We need to do a surgery at Nema or else we will be doing a disservice to the lives of millions of people across this country,” Kasipul MP Ong’ondo Were said. Last month, Tobiko assured residents that the ministry will take stern action against the factory if it is found culpable.
