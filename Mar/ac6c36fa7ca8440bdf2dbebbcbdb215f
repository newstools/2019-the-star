Utange squatters have asked IG Joseph Boinnet to rein in rogue officers used by private developers to intimidate them. They said the developers used the police to forcefully evict them. Village elder Mwanahamisi Abdalla said the those harassing them are often accompanied by APs. They claimed that developers carried dubious title deeds to claim land ownership. “The other day, they (police) came with a man who has been laying claim to this three-acre piece of land saying we should vacate our houses or they be demolished with us inside,” Abdalla said on Thursday. The land in dispute is said to belong to the government. The squatters filed a case in court after one of the rich people showed up with a title deed. The case was dismissed but an appeal is pending.The Court of Appeal issued a stay order on January 14. “Since that day, we are being intimidated and harassed by the tycoons,” Abdalla said. “They use AP officers who often come when we are not around and harass our children.” Kisauni deputy county commissioner Kipchumba Ruto said the squatters should sue. “The land has a title meaning it belongs to someone. If they doubt the authenticity of the title, they should go to court,” Ruto told the Star on Friday. He said he was not aware of police being used to harass the squatters and promised to investigate. The squatters asked Boinnet to get rid of rogue officers tarnishing the name of the police service. “We are seeing more cops being jailed. This should apply to those intimidating us too,” Mbogo Tsuma said. Kisauni squatters chairman Hashim Loma Mwakazi said court orders must be respected. “Where are we headed as a country if police cannot respect court orders?” he asked.
