A man shown on a video beating his wife in January has been arrested. James Muendo was seized on Saturday and locked up at Sultan Hamud police arrests station. He had been on the run since the video went viral. On January 15, Muendo is said to have arrived home drunk and started beating the wife. He rained blows and kicks on Margaret Nthambi. A neighbour took a video of the violence and shared it on social media. Muendo then disappeared but on Saturday, officers from Mukaa caught up with him. Makueni county commissioner Mohammed Maalim told the Star yesterday that Muendo was tracked from his hideout using technology. “You can run but you cannot hide because police will smoke you out,” Maalim said. He said the government will severely punish those involved in gender-based violence, rape and defilement. “Defilement and rape cases and the business of beating women like a snake in the 21st century must come to an end,” he said, adding, “God has given us brains to reason and resolve our differences amicably without fighting.”
