Reigning champion Lorenzo Gagli and 2016 winner Sweden’s Sebastian Soderberg headline the growing list of foreign players for this year’s Magical Kenya Open. The European Challenge Tour event, presented by ABSA, is slated for Karen Country Club from March 14 to 17 and will be preceded by the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters starting Thursday to Sunday this week. Tournament director, Patrick Obath is glad the winners of Oman and Qatar events will gain automatic invite from Category 3, which has winners of the 2019 season tournaments equal to or above US$1.75m, 2018 season tournaments equal to or above US$1.75m race to Dubai points and 2017 season tournaments equal to or above 1.5m euros. In this group is the go-getting Indian golfer Shubhankar Sharma, who won the 2018 Maybank Championship of Malasya. Italian Gagli is best remembered for vanquishing Swede Jens Fahrbring in a nerve-wracking three-way play-off on the Par 3 hole 13 to emerge the winner of the 2018 Barclays Kenya Open Championship at the Par 71 Muthaiga course. In what will perhaps go down in history as one of the most dramatic editions, Gagli and Fahrbring parred the hole twice before an enthusiastic crowd which included His Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister leader Raila Odinga. Soderberg, who led last year’s Kenya Open at penultimate stage is invited in Category 14 from the 2018 Challenge Tour ranking, after playing in 20 tournaments. Also in the group are Finn Kalle Samooja and Gagli. Soderberg won the 2016 Barclays Kenya Open with a gross score of 18-under 270 to set the tournament’s second best score in the Championship’s history. He has featured at the tournament on three other occasions including 2015 when he finished 104, 2017 placing 154th and 2018. “There are some high-profiled players we have invited for the sole purpose of commanding massive social media following,” said Obath. Notable names on the roster of foreign players also expected to take part in this year’s tournament include—South African duo of Hydn Porteous and Erik Van Rooyen. Tapio Pulkkanen is also among those expected. Europe’s 2018 Rider Cup captain Thomas Bjørn is invited in Category 5, which is the Legends Category for Players ranked within the top 40 of the 2018 career money list who meet 4 or more of the additional qualifying criteria for this category.
