Anglican Archbishop Jackson Sapit has asked the government to undertake smaller, less expensive water projects. The archbishop said on Sunday big water projects are done using loans that are misappropriated by the people in charge, leaving Kenyans with a bigger burden. These projects provide a loophole for ndividuals to embezzle the funds, which increases the country’s debt, he said. Sapit wants the government to prioritise projects that it can locally fund and ensure the funds are accounted for. “Most of these major water projects also displace members of the communities where they are constructed and destabilise their lives,” Sapit said on Sunday. Construction of water pans, boreholes and other minor projects, he said, would go a long way in increasing water connectivity. Sapit said small projects also take a short time to completeand are therefore more efficient. He condemned the recent corruption scandals involving mega dam projects . The archbishop urged leaders to ensure they are accountablefor their dockets. He was speaking at the consecration of St Paul’s Kiaguthu ACK church. Kenyansare disheartened by the massive misappropriation of money borrowed by the government while development projects are left incomplete, Sapit said.
