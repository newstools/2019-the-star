Trade PS Chris Kiptoo yesterday said that the government would not stop the importation of eggs from Uganda as it is the largest importer of Kenya goods. The price of a tray of eggs has dropped from Sh270 to Sh150 in the last year, allegedly because of the import of Ugandan eggs. Kiptoo has made the right decision. Firstly, there may be other factors behind the falling price of eggs. Maybe there is over-production of eggs in the Kenyan market itself. Secondly, prices will go up if imports are restricted and consumers will have to pay more. Thirdly, Kenya is in a common market where it exports Sh65 billion of goods to Uganda every year. It cannot turn around and say we will continue to export to you but you must stop sending us your eggs. In a single market, you win some and you lose some. If the egg market is over-supplied, then farmers need to turn to other high-value crops such as vegetables for urban markets. Kenyan farmers need to use their superior expertise to out-perform their regional neighbours.
