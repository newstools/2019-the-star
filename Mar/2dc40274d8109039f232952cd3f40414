Kenya intends to import 11 more multiple unit diesel locomotives at a cost of Sh1.5 billion. Transport PS Esther Koimett said on Tuesday that the new engines will serve the country for between 20-25 years. "When the full complement is in theyâ€™ll enable us to transport around 132,000 people a day compared to the 13,000 we do today," she said. The PS did not specify when shipment for the machines would be made. Unlike the current SGR passenger trains, a diesel multiple unit (DMU) does not require separate locomotives, as the engines are incorporated into one or more of the carriages. The diesel engine may be located above the frame in an engine bay or under the floor. Driving controls can be at both ends, on one end, or in a separate car. Click here for the latest political news
