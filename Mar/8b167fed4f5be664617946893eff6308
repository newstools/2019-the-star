Embattled Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa have been officially expelled from ODM party. The party's National Governing Council on Friday said Jumwa had been expelled for gross misconduct. Her Msambweni counterpart Suleiman Dori's case is still not clear. Jumwa and Dori have been accused of supporting DP William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. ODM leader Raila Odinga has not declared if he will contest in 2022 but his close ally Siaya Senator James Orengo has said he will. The National Governing Council is composed of the ODM league, National Executive Council, Youth League, the National Election Board and county coordinating committee officials. Others are governors, deputy governors, assembly minority and majority leaders and the parliamentary group.
