Council of Governors' chairperson Wycliffe Oparanya on Tuesday asked the national government to consider allocating more funds to the counties. During the 2018-2019 financial year there was an increase in revenue allocation to counties from Sh302 billion to Sh314 billion. Oparanya praised the milestones counties have made in the health sector. “Counties have been experiencing funding and human resource challenges. This must be tackled at this conference. Governors are ready and willing to support quality and affordable Universal Health Care to make Kenya a world-class hub for health services,” he said. The CoG chair has also said counties have put more effort to ensure the agricultural sector, water connection and ECD projects are successful. He, however, said the delay in releasing funds to counties had affected operations in the counties. “Insufficient allocation and the delay in the disbursement of funds to counties by the Treasury have nearly paralysed projects and hampered service delivery in counties,” Oparanya said. He said governors are ready to implement the President’s Big Four agenda, despite not being guided on their specific role. “The role of counties in implementing the Big Four agenda is not clear with some questions remaining unanswered. What is the expectation of counties' participation for the success of the Big Four agenda? He asked. "What is the policy framework that will facilitate coordination between the two levels of governments in implementing the Big Four agenda?” . The CoG chair also lauded the President’s move to fight corruption. He also said that the county governments will coordinate with national government to facilitate civic education in constituencies ahead of the census.
