French national carrier Air France is set to launch two additional weekly flights to Nairobi beginning April 1. The increased flights between Charles de Gaulle Airport and Jomo Kenyatta International Airport is part of the airline’s strategy to expand its African network. Air France last year resumed flights to Nairobi after an eighteen-year hiatus. “We will be increasing our flights on the Paris-Nairobi route to five flights a week and we are confident that we will continue this growth in the coming years,” said Arthur Dieffenthaler, Air France general manager for Eastern Africa. He was speaking during an event that brought together French companies in Kenya, organized by the French Chamber of Commerce. France also ranks among Kenya’s most significant tourism markets. “Immediately we resumed flights on the Paris-Nairobi route, we recorded higher bookings with our partner Kenya Airways,” said Dieffenthaler. The move will also benefit French and Kenyan companies especially in horticulture, pharmaceuticals and other businesses that depend on air transport. Air France also entered into a joint venture partnership with Kenya Airways to jointly operate 12 flights a week on the Nairobi-Paris route.
