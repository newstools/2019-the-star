The much anticipated long rains will be delayed to the third or fourth week of March, Weatherman Samuel Mwangi has said. The long rains season usually begins mid-February to May in most parts of the country. The Met department has advised farmers not to rush to plant crops before seeking advice as the rains are likely to be poorly distributed. “Most counties are still sunny and dry. The counties of Kitui, Makueni, Machakos, Kajiado, Taita Taveta, Nairobi, Nyandarua, Laikipia, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Murang'a, Kiambu, Meru, Embu and Tharaka are likely to receive rain on the third week of March. North Eastern and the coastal counties will receive rains in the fourth week of March,” Mwangi told the Star on Thursday.
