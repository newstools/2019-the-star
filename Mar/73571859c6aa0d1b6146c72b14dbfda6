Kisumu residents have faulted Nema Director General Geoffrey Wahungu for failing to tour Kibos Sugar and Allied Industries Limited over massive pollution. The disappointed locals wanted an audience with Wahungu to express their concerns over pollution from Kibos Sugar and Allied Industries. They wondered why Wahungu skipped a scheduled visit to the sugar miller on Thursday despite being in Kisumu. Wahungu instead went to Kodiaga prison to pay a courtesy call before heading to Busia to meet his counterpart from Uganda. “We have waited for him and his team in vain. We are suffering and we wanted to express our views to him,” Joel Ochieng, a Kibos resident said. Mary Juma asked Tobiko and his interior counterpart Fred Matiang’i to personally visit the area. “He is paid a salary from the taxes we pay. Why skip the event while in Kisumu?” Juma asked. But Wahungu said he visited Kibos on Wednesday. “We visited Kibos and our team took samples for test,” he said. He, however, declined to talk more on Kibos issue and instead asked the media to accompany him to Busia. Two sections of Kibos had earlier been closed for discharging industrial waste into River Kibos. Residents have been protesting against the pollution of their main source of water.
