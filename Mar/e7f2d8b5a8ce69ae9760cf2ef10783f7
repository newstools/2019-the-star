Record 17-time  Kenyan Premier League champions  Gor Mahia will hold a Special General Meeting on April 9. The club chairman Ambrose Rachier, who is also the KPL chair, confirmed the same with changing of the club’s constitution top of the agenda. The club changes are necessitated by the Caf Club Licensing laws and the Sports Act, that seeks to modernise structures, for smooth running of activities. A group of technocrats has been helping the club draft a constitution which will be presented for adoption by the Executive Council. The draft proposes only four elective posts in the executive away from the current one that has 11 elected members. The four proposed positions are the chairman, vice-chairman, secretary general and treasurer.  In the proposed constitution, the secretariat will be headed by a CEO who will run the club matters. The new draft also aims to lay the ground for professionalising and changing the community club into a limited company in the next 18 months. Gor Mahia deputy secretary, Ronald Ngala said they welcome the constitution being drafted by the professionals, since registered fans also proposed  their expectations and changes they deemed necessary. Meanwhile, Winnie Odinga  was yesterday appointed by  the club chairman as an Executive Member. Winnie, who is a daughter to club patron Hon Raila Amolo Odinga, will head the media and Publicity department. Ngala  said Winnie who is an incorporated  EC member has the capacity to steer the club’s communication department and push the club’s publicity more as they seek to create more history by making it to the Caf Confederations Cup semifinals. Former club's secretary general  Chris Omondi said a professionalised secretariat is a core pillar in the transformation of our club. " Such appointments must not only have the concurrence of the executive (as currently constituted) but also be anchored in our club constitution,” added  Omondi.
