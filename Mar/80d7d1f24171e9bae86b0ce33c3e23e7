Kenya Simbas have been lined up to play Portugal and Germany in July. Director of rugby Thomas Odundo, yesterday said they are keen on getting competitive fixtures for the Simbas away from the Africa Gold Cup. “We are looking at getting the two-game against Germany or Portugal and test ourselves against these teams in a bid to complement the fixtures we have from the continental matches,” added Odundo. Kenya last played Portugal in 2015 at the RFUEA ground, winning 41-15 and have lost twice to the Germans losing 29-28 at the RFUEA ground and  43-6 to the Europeans at the World Cup qualifying tournament in Marseilles, France last year. Odundo said their target this year is to win Africa Gold Cup and improve on the Simbas ranking which currently stands at 32 in the world. "We are looking at improving our ranking which has gone down in the past one year while at the same time seeking to win the Africa Cup,” added Odundo. The Simbas have finished second for the past three seasons to Namibia in the competition. The union is set to formally announce Paul Odera as the coach for the Simbas on a one-year contract. Odera will, in turn, announce the training squad for the international soon. "Once we make the formal announcement, then the coach will announce the training squad for our test matches,” he added. Elsewhere, Kabras' Phillip Wokorach leads Kenya Cup try-scorers chart with 23 tries. The Ugandan star has 23 tries to his credit and with two matches remaining against Strathmore Leos and Impala, the tally is likely to shoot up. Mwamba talisman Collins Injera is second on the log with 18. Kabras, who top the standings with 64 points, have four players in the top 10 including half-back Brian Tanga (7), Felix Ayange (7), Mario Wilson (6) and Claude Johannes (6) respectively.
