The Frontier Counties Development Council wants the Equalisation Fund ring-fenced to benefit the region, saying its purpose may not be achieved. Council chairman Ali Roba on Thursday said 10 of the 20 years of the fund have elapsed with nothing substantial achieved. The Mandera governor said the current system of the fund does not serve its intended purpose. “It is imperative that some enforcing provisions in law must be made because marginalised counties have not received the funds, hence, have not benefited,” Roba said. He spoke during the council’s conference for leaders from pastoralist communities in Garissa town. The Equalisation Fund was established to plug gaps of underdevelopment in previously mariginalised areas. The funds were meant to improve infrastructure, water, health and education facilities. The arid and semi-arid lands occupy nearly 70 per cent of Kenya’s land mass but is characterised by high levels of illiteracy, poverty, insecurity, water scarcity, poor infrastructure and basic services. Roba said huge amounts of the fund have not been released to the counties. “There is need to fix a time-frame for disbursements through a schedule,” he said. Roba said the cash must be allocated and disbursed as grant targeting underdeveloped areas in specific counties. “The President should take urgent action or anyone can sue for violation of the Constitution if the fund remains unimplemented,” the governor said. He urged regional leaders to unite because they face the same problems and opportunities. “We must be glued together to be able tackle these problems.” Leaders from 15 counties, including Wajir, Lamu, Tana River, Isiolo, Turkana, Marsabit, Samburu, Laikipia, West Pokot, Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet, were in attendance.
