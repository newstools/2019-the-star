Land brokers have been warned to keep off a disputed property at Modika in Garissa town. The warning came from County Commissioner Meru Mwangi after a man was killed over the land in the area last month. Tension has since then been high with residents accusing a “politically connected” private developer of erecting a perimeter wall on the 30-acre property without consulting those who have lived there for decades. Mwangi told journalists in Garissa town after visiting the property that police have cordoned off the area as investigations into the man's killing continue. He has met elders and religious leaders to bring to an end land issues in the county. The administrator said the government will not allow a few individuals to disrupt peace over land. Police will act firmly against law breakers, he added. Lands CEC Mohamed Shale urged residents not to erect structures outside Ring Road. He said the disputed land is alienated government property and the county was finalising the authorisation and approval of Usalama Development Plan. “When and until the county and the national government together with the National Land Commission conclude the allocation of the said land, any structure in that place is illegal and stands to be demolished,” Shale said. The CEC said security teams have been directed to ensure that no structures were erected outside Ring Road. Land remains a sensitive and emotive issue in the county where there are occasional conflicts pitting one clan against another. Lack of proper planning and title deeds are major challenges in the rapidly growing town. Two months ago, Lands Cabinet Secretary Farida Karoney said during a tour of Garissa said the national government will partner with the county in re-planning, adjudication, and titling of area settlements.
