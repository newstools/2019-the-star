Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi on Tuesday dismissed President Uhuru Kenyatta's tough stance that those accusing him of corruption should take the evidence to the DCI offices rather than complaining at funerals. Responding to the President through his Facebook page, the controversial lawmaker said that "Uhuru is DCI and DCI is Uhuru", implying that the President directly influences the work of the investigative agency. "Well, well, well said Mr President, I agree with you that we must not address these issues in funerals, weddings or other public functions. But unfortunately, Uhuru is DCI and DCI is Uhuru," he posted, attaching the now viral video of the President's speech at Kirinyaga University where the 6th Devolution Conference is underway. On Sunday, Sudi alleged the Directorate of Criminal Investigations is being used in the probe of the dams scandal to divert attention from the planned take over the KAA by Kenya Airways. "You have caused the sacking of so many innocent people and their cries will not go free. If you don't want certain people just tell them to resign instead of faking graft charges," he said. But at the conference, Uhuru dismissed those accusing him of involvement in graft and told them to present the evidence to the DCI.

The DP's allies accuse the DCI and the DPP of being used by his political detractors to trim to size and hamper his 2022 presidential ambitions.
