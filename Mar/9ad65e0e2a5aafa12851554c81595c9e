A chief magistrate’s court in Meru has sentenced a 33-year-old man to life imprisonment after he was found him guilty of sodomising two boys. Nicholas Mutuma, a father of one girl, was charged with sodomising two boys aged three and seven on March 11, 2017 in Imenti North. Chief magistrate Lucy Ambasi ruled that the prosecution had proven beyond any reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Six people, including the two children, testified. “Witnesses proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused actually committed the act and deserves a life sentence,”she said. The children said they had gone to fish in a stream when the accused lured them to enter the forest to help him recover a missing donkey. After walking several metres into the forest, the accused removed his underwear and undressed them.He then repeatedly assaulted them. Mutuma released them but threatened to beat them if they told their parents or authorities, the court heard. Their parents noticed their unusual movements and reported to Kambakia police post, where they were advised to visit Meru County Hospital. A medical report presented by Dr Winnie Mutunga indicated that the boys, a Standard 2 and nursery pupil, had been defiled. Mutuma had denied the charges.
