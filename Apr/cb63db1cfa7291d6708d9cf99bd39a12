Leaders from all over Kenya arrived on Thursday afternoon at Parliament buildings ahead of president Uhuru Kenyatta's speech. Uhuru who is currently reading his speech on the State of The Nation address arrived some minutes after the leaders arrived at the buildings. Clad in different attires, the leaders walked majestically as they showcased their prowess in dressing and walking styles. Earlier, the President said everyone must pay taxes in accordance with their wealth. "High net worth persons whose lifestyles are not reflective of the taxes that they pay must be compelled to demonstrate the source of their wealth and to contribute their share of taxes accordingly," Uhuru said. The President on Thursday maintained super-rich should be forced to disclose their sources of wealth so that they can be taxed appropriately.
