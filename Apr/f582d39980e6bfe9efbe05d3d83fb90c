Let Kenyans not lament the rejection of the loan by China for extension of the SGR. The Kenyan government should have got skills to transition from Phase 1 for us to complete the railway to Kisumu and Malaba.

Let us put our talents together and show the world we can complete the railway to the highest standard. Nairobi
