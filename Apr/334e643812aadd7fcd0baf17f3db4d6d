EACC detectives have arrested two Nairobi MCAs for demanding a bribe of Sh1 millionÂ  from the owners of Kiragu Waichahi School, which is built on public land. Jared Okoth of Mathare North ward and David Mberia of Karen were apprehended on Friday afternoon. They are members of Culture and Social Services committee. Their arrest came hours after anti-corruption officials arrested former Nairobi governor Evans Kidero and two others for irregular payment of Sh68 million by the Nairobi county government. The EACC has been investigating allegations of irregular payment made to Wachira Mburu, Mwangi and Company Advocates purporting it to be regular fees. DPP Noordin Haji said he found sufficient evidence to support criminal charges against Kidero, Wainaina, former Nairobi City Council acting director legal affairs Aduma Joshua Owuor and former mayor John Ndirangu.
