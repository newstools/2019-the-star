Several leaders, among them AU envoy Raila Odinga and chief justice David Maraga, are expected to attend the event. Workers were seen putting last minute touches to ensure everything is in order. The environment is that of anticipation amid expectations that the President will tackle key challenges in the country. Key issues of concern are unemployment, food security, corruption and succession politics. The ongoing crackdown on corruption, the unmet Big Four agenda timelines and promises and drought are expected to dominate the address. Uhuru will also address the nation at a time when the country’s economy seems to be sluggish, with the government struggling to meet its debt obligations due to suppressed revenue.
