Maurizio Sarri believes Gonzalo Higuain will remain at Stamford Bridge beyond the summer after joining Chelsea on loan from Juventus in January. Sarri decided to bring the Argentine striker in to replace Alvaro Morata, who left to join Spanish giants Atletico Madrid in January. Higuain has gone on to score four goals in 14 appearances for the Blues and Sarri insists the 31-year-old will be able to score a lot more for the club next season. “In theory, yes,” Sarri said, when asked if Higuain would be at Stamford Bridge next season. “It’s difficult to adapt to the Premier League. I think in the next season he will be able to score a lot. For a striker it is difficult to get used to the Premier League. I remember Suarez at Liverpool in [his] first season only scored three goals, then 16, then 24.” Chelsea have agreed a price of £31million to take Higuain on a permanent deal or they can pay £15.5m to secure his services for another year. Asked whether a deal will be sanctioned, Sarri insisted he was unsure. Sarri continued: “I don’t know. I’m not in charge of the market, so I cannot answer these questions.” If Higuain does return to Turin, Giroud will likely be promoted back to main man up top, with Chelsea facing a transfer ban. They west London side have been given a two-window transfer ban and fined £460,000 by Fifa for breaching the rules around the transfer of minors. They are unable to register new players, but are still allowed to sell. Chelsea have appealed against the ban, and are currently awaiting the verdict.
