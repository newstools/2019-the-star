Kenya's Brigid Kosgei won the 2019 Women's London Marathon clocking 2:18:20. Kosgei broke from the rest of the pack beating Vivian Cheruiyot who came in second at a time of 2:20:13. The 25-year-old Kenyan set a new personal best and now adds the London title to her Chicago win. Ethiopia's Roza Dereje came in third in a time of 2:20:51. Two other Kenyans, Gladys Cherono and Mary Keitany came in fourth and fifth respectively. “The win was a problem for me today; it was hard for me to get my breath but I’m very happy to have done so well. I’m extremely happy in my performance and everything went to plan,” Kosgei said. “I didn’t really know how far ahead I was, I looked back a couple of times then realised everything was ok." In October last year, Kosgei clocked the third fastest time in history clocking 2:18:35 to win the Chicago Marathon title in windy and wet conditions. Deputy President William Ruto was among leaders including President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga who congratulated the Kenyan performance at the marathon. "An exhilarating run by Brigid Kosgei to lead @VivianCheruiyot to a 1-2 Kenyan finish at the #LondonMarathon. A majestic, composed and confident performance. Great effort by Gladys Cherono and Mary Keitany," Ruto tweeted.
