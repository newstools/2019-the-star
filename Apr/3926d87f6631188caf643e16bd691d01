Ugandan musician turned opposition politician Bobi Wine has officially announced he will run for President in 2021. The 37-year-old will challenge President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power for 33 years. The singer calls himself the "ghetto president", and is a fierce critic of Mr Museveni. He was charged with treason last year over the alleged stoning of the presidential convoy. He denied the charges and was freed on bail. "On behalf of the people of Uganda I am challenging you [Mr Museveni] to a free and fair election in 2021," Bobi Wine said at an event in the capital, Kampala, to announce his candidacy. The singer, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has been an MP for two years, and portrays himself as a champion of the poor. Uganda's parliament approved changes to the constitution last year to scrap the age limit of 75 for presidential candidates. The move opened the way for the ruling party to nominate Mr Museveni, 74, to run for a sixth term. His supporters say he needs to remain in office to guarantee stability, and to promote economic development.
