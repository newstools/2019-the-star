The Anglican and Catholic churches have announced a ban on fund-drives or donations from politicians during their services.

It shouldn’t escape our attention that in every mega-scandal in our country, there are small fish playing the role the bigger fish. This means corruption is an intricate web involving those who would not appear guilty also. If the politicians’ money is unholy, so should that of a policeman who extorts money from motorists and a school principal who misuses funds. Freelance Journalist and Writer
