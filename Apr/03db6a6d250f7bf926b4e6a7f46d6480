Singer, producer and songwriter Kagwe Mungai is set to release a brand new album titled 'Spectrum'. It is a representation of five different genres that fully embody the title itself: hip hop, Afrobeat, dancehall and Afropop. This is Kagwe's first-ever album, and it is a significant marker in his career. So far, he has managed to release singles and collaborations. Speaking to Word Is, the artiste said if he wasn't a musician, he would be President. Talking about trolls he said they don't really get to him. "In fact, the more creative the troll, the more hilarious I find it. Recently I saw a tweet that read 'Kagwe Mungai makes music for dudes who put their leg on the bed while applying lotion'. I died."
