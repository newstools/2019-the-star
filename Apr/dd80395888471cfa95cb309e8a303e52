Former Auntie Boss actress Nyce Wanjeri says she did not concentrate at work for a whole month after her ex-husband Tito Wagithimo posted their differences on social media. "It was a shock to see him posting what no one knew was happening in our lives," Nyce said in a YouTube interview. The mother of one admits they had differences in the house, but no one knew about them. "I have a daughter that I have been protecting so that when she grows up, she will not be saying her parents were once fighting on social media, so I chose to keep quiet for her," she said. Nyce said she is not going back to her ex, admitting that co-parenting is hard. "He took it the way he felt good for him. There is a lot to follow about co-parenting, but my request to people is to stop sending me messages of what he is doing with his life," she said.
