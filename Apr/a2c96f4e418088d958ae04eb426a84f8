The government will not turn its back on fulfilling the Big Four agenda, President Uhuru Kenyatta has said. During his State of the Nation address on Thursday, the President urged both Houses of Parliament to fast-track the passing of bills crucial for attainment of the Big Four agenda. They include Land Value Index Laws (Amendment), Physical Planning, Irrigation, Warehouse Receipt System and Kenya Roads bills. The President said that realisation of the Big Four agenda is dependent on energy, transport, education, water and ICT sectors. Uhuru said the private sector can play a central role and act as a key pillar of the Big Four. “The delivery of the Big Four is on course. We expect the private sector to take advantage of the policies and incentives in place, and turn the four priority areas into mighty engines of wealth and job creation,” he said. The President said the government will enhance food production by putting 6,000 acres under irrigation. “To achieve the Big Four Agenda, adequate supply of electricity is, undeniably, a primary enabler. This is the reason why electricity generation and distribution has been at the top of our infrastructural development programme," he said. The President said that the government in collaboration with development partners has made tremendous gains in scaling-up connectivity over the last six years. He said the number of electricity connections has risen from 2.264 million in March 2013 to 7.029 million as at March 2019. The Head of State also said the government has implemented a rejuvenation of vocational training institutions, meant to build on the skills needed to contribute to nation building and in particular the manufacturing pillar of the Big Four. He also said corruption is the biggest hindrance to the Big Four agenda and called upon the Judiciary to give corruption cases priority.
