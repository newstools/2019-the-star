President Uhuru Kenyatta has called on the house to pass a Sh10 billion fund to heal wounds caused by ethnic-related violence. Speaking during the State of The Nation address in Parliament on Thursday, Uhuru said it will set heritage sites across the country to remind us of the journey we have travelled. "This should heal the wounds of historical wounds which has poisoned our politics and brought about ethnicity," he said. "With parliament's help, we will apply this to establish symbols of hope. The unity we are pursuing is not only brothers and sisters but also in the EAC and the continent." Uhuru said everyone must appreciate the importance of unity for the progress of the nation. "That is why we have the Building Bridges Initiative, commonly known as the Handshake. In all our cultures a handshake is an expression of goodwill, friendship, trust and reconciliation. It is synonymous with peace," he said.
