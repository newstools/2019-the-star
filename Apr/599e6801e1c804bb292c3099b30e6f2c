Chelsea’s hopes of signing Philippe Coutinho from Barcelona in the summer could depend on FIFA lifting their transfer ban. According to Diario Sport in Spain, the London club are ready to provide the Brazil star with a route out of the Nou Camp after his first full season in La Liga but the transfer ‘rests in FIFA’s hands’. Chelsea need to overturn the two-window ban imposed upon them by FIFA for breaching rules regarding signing players under the age of 18. Coutinho has struggled to settle in Barcelona’s side following his £142million move from Liverpool in January 2018 and could be enticed into a Premier League return. His potential move to Chelsea would also help cover the impending exit of Eden Hazard, who is widely expected to sign for Real Madrid in the summer. Coutinho has struggled to cement a place in the Barcelona starting line-up and was recently jeered by supporters in their 3-1 win over Rayo Vallecano. The 26-year-old irked Barcelona’s fans by celebrating a goal against Manchester United in the Champions League by putting his fingers in his ears. Coutinho has scored 11 times in 49 games in all competitions for Barcelona and is getting set to take on former club Liverpool in the Champions League semi-finals next week. Chelsea, meanwhile, are close to sealing a top-four position in the Premier League. They are a point clear of fifth-placed Arsenal and their next game is against a Manchester United side in free-fall at Old Trafford on Sunday. They are also in the semi-final of the Europa League and will meet German side Eintracht Frankfurt, who are fourth in the Bundesliga.
