The parcel of land in question is in Mombasa. The DPP directed that Swazuri and the 23 others be charged with Conspiracy to commit an economic crime, abuse of office and financial misconduct. Other charges that face includes fraudulent acquisition, dealing with suspect property and money laundering.
