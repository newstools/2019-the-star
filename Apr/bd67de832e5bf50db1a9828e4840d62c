Chebet was in superb form as she clinched the junior cross country diadem in Aarhus, Denmark in one of the closest finishes in the history of the event. Chebet won the crown by the thickness of the vest, edging out Ethiopian pair of Alemitu Tariku and Tsigie Gebreselama. To settle for the coveted award, Chebet edged out world cross senior women’s champion Helen Obiri, Simon Ngige who was the top-ranked Kenyan golfer at the recent Kenya Open and Pipeline volleyballer Sharon Kiprono, who was voted best attacker at the Africa Club Championship in Egypt.
