As drought across the 13 worst-hit counties continues to worsen, Hulugho MCA Adow Omar wants the national government and development partners to help with water trucking. Speaking to journalists in Holugho town on Tuesday after touring the most affected areas in his ward, Omar said the two water trucks serving Hulugho are not enough as the remaining wells and water pans have dried up. “As at yesterday, the only water well that has been supplying water to residents of Hulugho had dried up. Residents drew water for the last time yesterday and henceforth, they will rely on water trucking,” Omar said. He said Hulugho town is facing an acute water shortage. “This could have far-reaching effects on the security in the area. How do you expect a police officer who has no water to drink to operate?” he posed. The MCA said several water pans and dams have dried up and the risk of human-wildlife conflict is imminent. He said during the 2002 drought, buffaloes killed two children as people and animals competed for water. “The way things are going, we could witness a repeat scenario. We don’t want to go the same route. The government, through KWS, should think of providing water to the wild animals,” he added. His calls come days after Baringo MCAs urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare the current drought a national disaster to pave for the international community to come in and assist. The national government has insisted the situation has not reached a crisis level and is manageable. The worst hit regions include the Northeastern counties of Garissa, Marsabit, Wajir and Mandera. The others are Nyeri (Kieni area), West Pokot, Isiolo, Kitui, Samburu, Tana River, Turkana, Kilifi and Laikipia.
