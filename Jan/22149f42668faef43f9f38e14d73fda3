Two people linked to last weekâ€™s murder of a lorry driver have been charged with robbery and violence. The two, Alice Moriasi and Fredrick Ouma denied the charges before senior resident magistrate Millicent Nyigei at Nyando Court in Kisumu on Thursday. Moriasi faced a second count of handling stolen goods which she has denied as well. They were later released on a bond of Sh1m and a surety of a similar amount each and detained at Kodiaga maximum prison as they process the bond. The incident happened on Friday after a lorry that was ferrying the consignment from Sony Sugar Company in Migori to Oyugis in Homa Bay county failed to reach its destination. According to the Nyanza DCI boss Michael Baraza, the lorry was found abandoned in Katito area, with the body of the driver behind it. However on Sunday, six suspects including the two charged were arrested by police officers investigating the matter. Click here for the latest political news
