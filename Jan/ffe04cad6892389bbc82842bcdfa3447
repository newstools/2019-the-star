A 38-year-old man in Nandi county yesterday hacked his wife to death before hanging himself. The man from Kapkatet village had separated with Ednah Kurgat after a quarrel. Residents said efforts to reconcile were futile. The mother of three went to live at her uncle’s home near Ndalat, three kilometres away. He waited for Kurgat at the home and slashed her with a panga several times and fled. “He slashed her several times in the head and other parts of the body. I pleaded but he went on and killed her,” Emily Sawe, Edna’s aunt, said. The attack was sudden and shocking, he said. He was later found hanging from a tree at his parents’ home. MP Vincent Tuwei and deputy county commissioner Sammy Makhanu condemned the attack. “We have very many incidents of domestic violence in this area and that is because of high consumption of alcohol and drugs,” Makhanu said.
