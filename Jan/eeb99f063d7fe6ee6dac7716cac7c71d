Lurambi MP Titus Khamala has been criticised by Western leaders over his demand that the Masinde Muliro University council hire a Luhya VC. Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli and Malava MP Malulu Injendi dismissed the demands as irresponsible and primitive. The council plans to recruit a new VC after Fredrick Otieno’s term expired on November 30. “What Khamala is saying is not the thinking of Luhyas. That type of thinking can only come from some primitive communities, not Luhyas,” Atwoli said. He said the university is not a Luhya institution and anyone appointed by the council should be supported to run it as long as he or she is qualified. Professionals, not ethnic groups, run universities, the unionist cautioned. Malulu described Khamala’s remarks as unfortunate. He said demanding that a native run the institution is unfair. “What will then happen to Luhya professionals heading universities located in other communities? Should the Luhyas there be sacked and sent home?” he asked. Malulu said any competent person has a right to head the university. “After all, the two VCs who have led the institution since its inception are both Luhyas.” On Thursday, Khamala said Western politicians would not allow a non-native to take charge, otherwise, it will not be business as usual. Khamala said that Luhyas had been locked out of jobs and had not been given tenders. “We’re tired of being a dumping ground. Our sons are ejected elsewhere. We have nothing we can’t take pride in the university.”
