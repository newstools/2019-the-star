Comedian and actress Jacquey Nyaminde, popularly known as Wibroda, has admitted that she had a misunderstanding with Charles Bukeko in the hit TV show owned by Royal Media Services, 'Papa Shirandula'. "However, we are still good friends outside here and we even talk," Wilbroda told Word Is on Thursday. A close source whispered to Word Is last year that Charles Bukeko removed Wilbroda from the show after she joined Milele FM, which is under Media Max Limited. "I just had to take some break mainly because I was going to a new media house and, therefore, there must have been some conflict of interest," Wilbroda said. "We left it open and that is why even the show has not announced that Wilbroda left because there is still room for negotiations for me to go back."
