London-based Queens counsel Khawar Qureshi will lead the prosecution in the fraud trial of Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu. An application by the DCJ to have him barred was dismissed yesterday by five judges of the High Court.Justices William Musyoka, Mumbi Ngugi, Helen Omondi, Francis Tuiyot and Chacha Mwita said the Qureshi was properly appointed by the DPP. They said appointment of a foreign jurist is not a surrender of the DPP’s mandate. The judges said Mwilu should have challenged Quereshi through a constitutional petition. Mwilu, through lawyers James Orengo and Okong’o Omogeni, wanted the gazette notice appointing Qureshi declared illegal on grounds his appointment was irregular. The same court also dismissed an application by the DPP, seeking to have Orengo and Omogeni barred from representing Mwilu. Secretary of Public Prosecutions Dorcas Oduor wanted them out on grounds of conflict of interest because they sit in the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee. But the bench said there was no evidence showing the merit of the case was discussed, when the DPP was questioned on Qureshi’s appointment. The case will proceed on February 18.
