Bandari coach Bernard Mwalala has challenged his playing unit to carry their Kenyan Premier League form to the SportPesa Cup as they take on Tanzania’s Singida United in the opening match today at the National Stadium, Dar-es-salaam. Bandari are unbeaten in the opening eight KPL rounds and will be looking to carbon copy their superb displays in the tournament which starts at the quarters. Mwalala, a former Yanga player, expressed confidence that their current form will be unmatched by Singida who recently beefed their technical bench by acquiring the services of Dragon Popadic of Serbia as their new coach and called upon his charges to capitalise on the platform and showcase their talents to the world. “We are unbeaten in our eight league matches back at home and I challenge my players to carry the same form in today’s match and the rest of the tournament. We are going to approach a game at a time and I believe we will emerge victorious. This tournament is a platform for our players to showcase their talents to the world since the matches will be live. It’s an opportunity the players should make it count on their professional careers.” Mwalala further urged his charges to draw inspiration from their back to back wins over Kenyan champions Gor Mahia and book a place in the semis. Bandari have beaten K’ogalo twice with a similar goal margin of 2-1 within a space of three months and Mwalala believes victory over a team of Gor’s calibre is enough to motivate his side to advance further in the tournament and hopefully be crowned the new champions.
