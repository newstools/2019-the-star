Nzoia Sugar Factory acting manager Michael Kulundu was on Wednesday night attacked at a hotel near Kanduyi. His personal driver had dropped him off at Salmond Hotel along the Webuye Malaba highway. Police told the Star a passerby who found Kulundu unconscious in a ditch on Thursday morning took him Aga Khan Hospital in Kisumu. He had deep panga cuts on his head and hands. Bungoma Police Commander Francis Sang said county DCIO officers have reports that Kulundu was called by someone through his secretary who requested to meet him. His driver left the hotel after dropping him off. Sang said police found Kulundu's phone at the place he was found unconscious. "We have the number of the person who called him to the restaurant. We are pursuing leads and will make arrests," Sang said. He asked members of the public to give information that will assist the police to arrest those behind the attack. Sang said three people suspected to have been armed with pistols may be the ones who hijacked him. Police said Kulundu's driver is also being questioned over the attack. Kulundu has been the acting manager at the sugar miller for the past two years. A source, who sought anonymity, said the attack comes days after some MCAs had tabled a motion in the assembly to oust him. The source said angry workers who have not been paid for three months may be behind the attack. He said they are unable to pay fees for their children as schools open on Thursday.
