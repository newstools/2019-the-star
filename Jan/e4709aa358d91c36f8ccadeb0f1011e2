King of Benga Dan Aceda will be hosting a masterclass at Kenyatta University tomorrow. “I will focus mainly on songwriting, music business, performance and stagecraft. Like I said, the goal is to share knowledge with a person who is already working on their craft,” he said in a press statement. Adding, “Because this is not really targeted to the person who is a total beginner. It’s more towards a person who has already started their career and is working to grow. So the assumption is that the person attending this already knows stuff. So I’m not starting from zero.” The star recently released his latest music offering, an album titled ‘Accelerata’. He said the masterclass is his way of sharing what he knows from his years of experience of being in the industry. “I have unofficially and informally been doing this work. I have had so many musicians come to my studio just to talk and share. Not that I’m a super expert but I’ve largely kept my door always open. So I would like to be more formal and maybe the sharing will help another person.” So what is his legacy? “I don’t know about legacy but I know for me, somebody taught me the stuff I know and sharing that stuff would cost me nothing.”
