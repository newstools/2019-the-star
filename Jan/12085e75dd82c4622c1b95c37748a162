Former Kiambu governor William Kabogo says the referendum should address issues affecting Kenyans and not create positions for politicians. He said an audit should be done on the 2010 Constitution to check its weaknesses. “The audit will help 'Wanjiku' understand what excites and pains him or her. 'Wanjiku' will come up with long-term solutions on how to be governed and how key national issues can be fixed,” Kabogo said. He was responding to the referendum debate in a phone interview on Monday. Kabogo said weak laws will be strengthened and the Constitution improved to serve Kenyans better. He said the referendum should strengthen devolution by increasing the allocation of funds to counties from 15 per cent to 35 per cent. Kabogo wants everyone involved in the constitutional reform process and "all parties should agree" before the referendum. He said the parliamentary and presidential system should be merged to avoid a scenario of the winner takes it all. "Public participation is crucial so that some people are not left behind," he said.
