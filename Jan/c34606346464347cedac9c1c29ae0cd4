Dark smoke, orange flames engulfed part of Nyeri on Tuesday after matatu and taxi operators protested against poor road infrastructure. Burning tyres and carrying banana leaves, the residents said MP Ngunjiri Wambugu has neglected their pleas. "We have been complaining every year but the MP is not doing anything. Roads are being made in some parts but here we have been neglected," one protester said. "Our MP is just fighting with the government and does not bother to come and fight for us here." Matatus in Ruare ward have been forced to use an alternative route because of potholes on the road. The residents lit bonfires and closed the road next to Baden Powell road. "We are asking Deputy President William Ruto to come here and see how we are suffering. The roads look like gardens. If they are gardens then we will plant bananas," Ruare ward MCA Paul Kanyare said. He said they had called the MP to look into the roads but he has not done anything. Another operator Joseph Rua said the state of the road has worsened in the last five years. He said the operators will paralyse business in the entire town if the road is not repaired in a month. He called on Wambugu to intervene and have the road fixed. “We are going to close this road altogether and plant food crops here so that they can notice our seriousness,” he said Contacted for comment, Nyeri town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu said they are pushing for the road to be fixed. “Part of the problem has been the ‘owner’ of the road. There was confusion whether it’s a Kerra, Kura or if it is a county road. My office has been told it’s a county road,” said Wambugu. “However, the governor told me it’s a Kura road and that the regional engineer has confirmed works would start in February.” The county director of communication Carol Nderi in a message to the media confirmed the road belongs to Kura.
