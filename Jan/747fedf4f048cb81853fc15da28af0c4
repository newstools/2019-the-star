R&B singer Chris Brown has been arrested in Paris on suspicion of rape. A 24-year-old woman is said to have accused Brown of raping her on the evening of January 15 at a hotel in the French capital. Two police officials said Brown and two other people are in custody in Paris today after a woman filed a rape complaint. Brown was detained on Monday and is still in custody Tuesday while police study the complaint, they said. One of the others detained is said to be Brown's bodyguard, according to one of the police officials. The French edition of Closer magazine reported that the woman had accused Brown of raping her at the Mandarin Oriental hotel. She said she met Brown at Le Crysal, a nightclub close to the Champs Elysee, and then returned to his hotel with other women and a total of three men. The alleged victim reportedly claimed that Brown had invited her to the hotel and then attacked her when they were left alone together. The woman is also said to have accused Brown's bodyguard and another friend of the singer of abusing her. 'He is accused of a rape and is being held at the judicial police offices in the 1st arrondissement,' said a prosecuting source. 'He was arrested with two others on Monday, and interviews and other enquiries are ongoing. The offence is said to have taken place on the night of January 15 this year.' Paris prosecutors now have the option of releasing Brown and his associates, or opening a criminal investigation. Brown's publicists at Sony Music would not immediately comment. He has been in repeated legal trouble since pleading guilty to the felony assault in 2009 of his then-girlfriend, Rihanna, in the US. He completed his probation in that case in 2015. Model Liziane Gutierrez also claimed she was punched in the face by the father-of-one but the case was settled out of court.
