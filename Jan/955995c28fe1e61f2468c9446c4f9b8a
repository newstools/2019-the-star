Kisii governor James Ongwae on Monday told his colleagues in the Lake Region Economic Bloc to involve residents and elected leaders when implementing policies. He said in a statement on Monday, this will make them own the policies. "In Kisii, we are engaging with the local leadership, and various forums including the Kisii Council of Elders, the youth, women's groups and other focal units in a bid to make LREB a people-driven initiative," he said. The bloc is set to hold a summit on January 10 and 11 in Kisii town. The summit will be led by Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya. Fourteen counties surrounding Lake Victoria are part of the bloc. They are Kakamega, Kisumu, Homa Bay, Migori, Siaya, Bomet, and Bungoma. Others are Kericho, Busia, Nandi, Nyamira, Trans Nzoia, Vihiga and Kisii. Ongwae said the summit will discuss issues of economic interest to the region "with the aim of uplifting the lives of over 14 million inhabitants of our region." Since 2018, the regional economic outfit has been pushing for the establishment of a regional bank to support businesses in the counties.
