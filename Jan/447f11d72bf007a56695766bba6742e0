Hotels in Lamu recorded a 90 per cent bookings from international tourists between December and January 2019. County tourism records show that most of visitors were from Europe and US. This a sign that the tourism sector is finally healing after having been brought to near collapse by a spate of terror attacks between 2014 and 2016. The worst were the attacks and killings of civilians in Mpeketoni, Witu, Hindi, Kibaoni and around the Boni forest by suspected al Shabaab militants. Lamu county executive for Tourism Dismas Mwasambu (below) attributed the massive improvement of the sector to better security. However a recent attack at Nairobiâ€™s Dusit hotel and office complex that left 21 dead is yet to filter through the accounts of the hoteliers.
