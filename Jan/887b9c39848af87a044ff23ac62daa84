"Our highest concern is the safety and well-being of our guests and employees, and we are providing support in every way we can. Efforts are ongoing to get in touch with all staff members and guests who were at the hotel to ensure they are all accounted for." He said they are still in constant contact with local authorities and organisations taking part in the rescue efforts and will continue supporting their efforts in every way possible. He further thanked police officers and the Recce Squad for their swift response to the attack claimed by al Shabaab.
