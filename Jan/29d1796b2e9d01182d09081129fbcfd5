Raila Odinga on Saturday took President Uhuru Kenyatta on an unplanned tour of the Kisumu Port where a dredger will clean up the lake. Uhuru and Raila were driven away from the Kisumu International Airport in two unmarked cars. The President was on his way out of the lakeside town after attending the burial of former Youth Fund CEO Bruce Odhiambo. But before Uhuru boarded his plane, whose engines were already running, , he was pulled aside by Raila who must have briefed him of the development. The President proceeded with the tour without his bodyguards. His flight to Nairobi was delayed for about four hours. Kisumu deputy governor Mathews Owili yesterday told the Star the activities at the port followed a meeting Nyanza leaders had with Uhuru during last year’s launch of the universal health coverage project. He said the President, while at the port, told leaders that he was keen on reviving the lake region’s economy. The government, through the Kenya Ports Authority, has embarked on revive the facility.
