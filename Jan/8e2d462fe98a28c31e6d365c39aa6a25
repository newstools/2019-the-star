Five people who pretended to be employees of United Nations have been charged in an Eldoret court with defrauding farmers of maize worth more than Sh 2 million. They collected the money from farmers in Uasin Gishu pretending that they had won a tender to supply the maize to the UN at better prices. The accused persons denied the charge when they appeared before Chief Magistrate Charles Obulutsa. The five suspects are Sammy Kiria, Paul Muasya, Martin Kariuki, Samson Maiyo and John Odhiambo. Obulutsa ordered each of them to be released on a bond of Sh 1 million. They were arrested early this week in Eldoret where they had gone to deliver the maize to a private Miller. Farmers who had released their maize to the suspects complained to police after sensing that they would lose their produce. "They had cheated us that they would pay better prices after delivering the maize to the UN but later we found them selling the produce to a miller", said one of the farmers. The four claimed in court that they had been tortured by police after being arrested. "We were beaten badly after being arrested and our bodies are swollen. We need medication your honour", said Kiria. They asked the court to release them on bail so that they can seek medication. Obulutsa directed the lead criminal investigating officer to appear in court on 28th to explain how and why the suspects were tortured. Maize farmers are currently facing marketing problems for their produce and the government has planned to buy only 2 million bags at sh 2,500 per bag at the NCPB.
