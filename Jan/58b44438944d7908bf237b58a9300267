ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi (pictured) has urged the government to conduct the census digitally to  ensure accuracy. Mudavadi said the census this year should capture biometrics of all Kenyans to ensure final results are safe from manipulation.  “We want to be sure people being counted are alive and not dead,” Mudavadi said in Lugari on Saturday. The national census is set to be conducted in August. Mudavadi said the accuracy of the results was critical because it will be used to determine development and revenue sharing amongst counties. He said those opposed to the use of biometrics were not genuine. He was in Lugari for the burial of Lugari MP Ayub Savula’s daughter at Manyonyi village. Last week, Mudavadi asked the government to disclose its census plans to Kenyans. Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya asked elected leaders to ensure proper guidance of residents. He said leaders should educate their people to ask relatives living outside their counties to return home to be counted in their villages. “Sharing of revenue to counties will depend on their population and it’s important that you ask our people to come and be listed at home for us to get our rightful share of the national cake,” Oparanya said. The proposed new formula for revenue allocation to counties is based on new parameters that consider devolved functions such as health, water, agriculture and technical training besides population.
