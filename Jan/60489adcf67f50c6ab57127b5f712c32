The Teachers Service Commission is under immense pressure from Knut in the wake of the looming strike on Thursday. The teachers' union and the commission seem to thrive on threats, going by the past grandstanding positions, only for them to eventually end up at the negotiating table. They have, unnecessarily, elevated brinkmanship into a lethal weapon of negotiation. The TSC has announced plans to hire 180,000 new teachers, if Knut, as it had announced, goes ahead and paralyses schools. The new hires cannot be a magical solution. The grievances that have sparked off the stand off are not new - mass transfers of head teachers and policy of teacher promotion. Both have lost focus about the seriousness of their national roles and are now in pursuit of a game of arm-wrestling that serves nobody save for the egos of both Knut big wigs and the technocrats at TSC. It is a waste of critical negotiation time. The ability to convene talks is a strength rather than a weakness. The union and the TSC must demonstrate that they can resolve their difference in a mature and amicable manner without recklessly wasting public cash and eroding public confidence in state run schools.
