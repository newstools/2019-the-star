Champions Kenya Prisons have welcomed the return of experienced middle blocker Brackcidise Agala, Joan Jelagat and Anne Lowen ahead of African Club Championship set for March 16-25 in Cairo, Egypt. Agala and Jelagat are fresh from maternity leave while Lowen is back from a knee injury she picked during the 2017 World Championship in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The three players missed the Kenya Volleyball Federation national play-offs last year but the wardresses still went ahead to reclaim the title they last won in 2013. The presence of Agala in particular is a major boost to the squad that finished fourth during the last year’s Africa Club Championship, thanks to her experience and exposure but more so her ability to switch from middle to left attacking department. Kenya Prisons’ assistant coach Azenga Mavisi said the availability of the three players gives them more options to choose from ahead of the Africa Club Championship and 2019 KVF national league. The official admitted that they haven’t made any major signing this season, a move he said will work for them in terms of consistency. Mavisi said: “The training is going on well. We started ball work this week after getting the players in shape for the last one month. We have the same players we had last season and really, there is nothing much to do when it comes to gelling. It would have been different if we had acquired new players.”
