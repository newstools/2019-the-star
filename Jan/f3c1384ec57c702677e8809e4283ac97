The widow of former Vice President George Saitoti has been sued for blocking an access road in upmarket Lavington, Nairobi. Margaret Saitoti is alleged to have blocked the road linking Mzima Springs Road to Olenguruone Avenue. Two lobby groups and an individual want her compelled to remove the barrier, pending conclusion of the case. Ukweli Usemwe and Uzalendo, alongside Joseph Kihanya, also sought an order compelling the Margret to table before court all documents relating to acquisition of the parcel and subsequent joining of the two plots. They have also sued the Kenya Power MD, Lands CS, the National Land Commission, Nairobi governor, director of city planning, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General. The petitioners have urged the court to speedily resolve the dispute, saying the action has caused huge inconvenience to residents. “That by the above action of blocking the road respondents [Margaret and the others] infringed on the freedom of movement for the citizens of the Republic of Kenya, contrary to Article 39 of the Constitution,” the suit papers read. They say Margaret fenced off parcel 3734/675, which they say belongs to the KPLC, and her plot 3734/676. The three attached a copy of a letter by Lavington Residents’ Association informing the county police commander of their intentions to hold protests. The letter is dated January 24. Also attached to the suit papers is a document showing one of the lobby groups, Ukweli Usemwe, is registered as a society working in Nakuru county. Click here for
