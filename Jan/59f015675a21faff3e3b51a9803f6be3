A remark by Public Works PS Paul Maringa insinuating that Lamu youth are lazy has angered residents. During a tour of the Lamu Port South Sudan Ethiopia Transport corridor project site at Kililana last month, the PS said only 50 out of the 1,200 youth working on the project are from Lamu town. Maringa said the few youths who are hired quit shortly after citing a myriad of excuses. Builders of the port have been forced to hire most casual labourers from the neighbouring counties. But on Monday, Lamu elders, activists, youths and women’s groups said they were shocked by the statement, which they dismissed as untrue. They said the government was looking for excuses after failing to involve the Lamu people in LAPSSET. Elder Mohamed Mbwana said the government should apologize to them. “No one wants to tell us what is going on at LAPSSET. That’s how much we have been sidelined. Our youths will appreciate even causal jobs but no one tells us when they are hiring,” he said.
