Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has backed the proposal to expand the executive arm of government to include a Prime Minister. In his memorandum to the Building Bridges team, Kuria proposes a structure comprising the President, Deputy President, Prime Minister, two deputy Prime Ministers. The changes require a referendum to be effected. Kuria has proposed to the Wajir Senator Yusuf Haji-led task force that each party presenting candidates in a presidential election shall present a team of five candidates. He suggests that the persons nominated for President and Deputy President shall not be members of Parliament. The legislator adds that a candidate fielded for the Prime Minister’s post may vie as MP or be nominated automatically if the presidential candidate in his/her party wins. For the Deputy Prime Minister post, Kuria proposes that there be two slots – one held by a person eligible for election as MP and the other by a person eligible for election as senator. “The second deputy Prime Minister who may vie as a member of the Senate and who, if not be elected, will automatically become a nominated member of the Senate if the President wins,” he says. The MP adds that not more than one candidate for the above positions shall be from the same ethnic community. “The Prime Minister and the Deputy Primier shall be members of Cabinet,” he states.
