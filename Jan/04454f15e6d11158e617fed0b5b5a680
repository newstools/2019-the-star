North Rift maize farmers have expressed concern over the lack of fertiliser, saying it could result in late planting. The government is yet to order the purchase of subsidised fertiliser. Farmers from Uasin Gishu, West Pokot, Trans Nzoia, Nandi and Elgeyo Marakwet counties haven’t started ploughing due to the uncertainties surrounding the supply of farm inputs. The farmers normally start buying fertiliser from the National Cereals and Produce Board in January ahead of planting which begins from March. Kenya Farmers Association director Kipkorir Menjo on Tuesday asked the government to tell farmers whether there will be subsidised fertliser. “They should tell us in advance so that farmers can look for alternatives in good time,” Menjo told reporters in Eldoret. He said a major crisis meeting was scheduled for next week at the Teachers Advisory Centre where farmers will make resolutions. He was accompanied by farmers’ representatives from the counties. He said several MPs including Silas Tiren (Moiben) and Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills) will attend the meeting.  ”The government should hasten the purchase of subsidised fertiliser for to plant on time,” farmer Kimutai Kolum said. North Rift NCPB regional manager Gilbert Rotich said they have not received subsidised fertiliser.
