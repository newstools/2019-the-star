Motorists in the CBD will continue paying Sh300 parking fees — instead of Sh200 —as printing and digital work has been delayed. Parking director Tom Tinega yesterday said they could not implement the new lower fees before receiving the printed document. “Once a Finance Bill has been passed, our work is easier,” he told the Star. “Then the document goes to the Kenya Government Printer and changes are later made in a digital, not a manual system.” The Nairobi City County Finance Bill 2018, which stipulates fees and levies payable to the county government by business people and residents seeking services, was passed last month by the Nairobi County Assembly and was later signed by Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko. In what they call a move to ease the burden on ‘Wanjiku’, the Budget and Appropriations Committee reduced the parking fees within the CBD from the proposed Sh400 by the Executive to Sh200. Car owners currently pay Sh300 per day for parking. ONLINE SYSTEMS TO TAKE TIME However, city motorists have since continued paying Sh300.Many motorists are not aware that they are required to pay only Sh200 instead of Sh300. City Hall had earlier told the Star that it would take a while for lower fee to take effect because the county has to adjust its online systems to register Sh200. Tinega said City Hall will instruct online payment company JamboPay to configure the changes in the system. City Hall automated parking fees collection in April 2014 to increase its revenue after the manual system was blamed of leakages that denied the county cash.
