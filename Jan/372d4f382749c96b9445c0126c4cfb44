Plans are underway to open a fish feed processing plant in Naivasha to meet rising demand. Nakuru governor Lee Kinyanjui said a study showed the current production of fish feed in the country could not meet demand. The county has identified two acres of land near Kihoto estate for location, with funds expected to be available in the next financial year. “Fish farming is one of the most lucrative trades in the country at the moment, and the county will take advantage of this by producing more fish feed,” he said. The governor said the county has set aside funds for the construction of a hatchery for fingerlings. The governor said Sh5 million has been set aside for the rehabilitation of the Naivasha fish hatchery located near Lake Naivasha. Fish farmers travel to Sagana in Central Kenya to buy fingerlings. “This will be a major milestone as far as fish production around Lake Naivasha is concerned and the construction will start in the coming month,” he said. This came as a high powered delegation led by National Environmental Management Authority director general Geoffrey Wahungu toured Lake Naivasha ahead of a planned tour by Environment CS Tobiko Keriako. The tour follows complaints over the rising water hyacinth weed and encroachment of the riparian land by investors. “The CS of environment will tour the lake this week to address some of the current challenges that include water hyacinth, water abstraction and riparian land,” said the officer.
