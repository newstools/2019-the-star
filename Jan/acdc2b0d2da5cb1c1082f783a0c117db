Equity Bank team have acquired the services of coach Sammy Kirongo as they seek to improve on their last season fifth place finish in the 2018 Kenya Volleyball Federation National League. This year’s edition serves off on March 1 and the bankers are leaving nothing to chance, hiring the experienced Kirongo to replace Jeremiah Mukopi, whom they parted ways with after he requested that he be relieved of his duties. Equity team manager Nicholas Bitok confirmed Kirongo’s new role, adding that he begins his duties this weekend when he oversees the team’s two-day trials this Friday at the Railways Club. Bitok said they have given the coach a free-hand to select players whom he feels will help the team to a play-offs slot. He said: “We have a new coach after Mukopi wanted out. If people were keen during the last season’s final legs, Mukopi was not on the bench and we had Geoffrey Omondi stand in as a caretaker coach.” “Kirongo has been in this field for a long time, both at club and national team level and I believe he has a lot of experience and exposure that will be helpful to our side. All in all, I wish him the very best as he takes charge of the team.” On whether Kirongo will make additions to the current team or head for an overhaul, Bitok said: “We will have to wait and see. Each coach comes with his goals and therefore, whatever he will decide on, we will give him the support.” Click here for the latest political news
