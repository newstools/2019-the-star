Sharon Ateya scored a brace to help Khalaba Girls win 2-1 against Shitoto during the inaugural Kenya Schools Lacrosse Championships oat Sacred Heart Mukumu Girls secondary school grounds over the weekend . On their way to the final, Khalaba overpowered Shibale 2-0 in the first semi as Shitoto saw off Moi Eldoret 2-0 to reach final in the newly introduced sport in western region. Ateya, who is part of the Kenya Select team that will compete in the August’s World Under 19 Lacrosse Championships in Canada, struck the opener barely 10 minutes into the match before sealing the match in the dying minutes of play. Maurine Akhoywa scored the lone goal for the losers in the match that also featured Kenya Select side, Messiah College from United States of America and Canaan of Uganda. Ateya was elated with her performance. “I am happy to have handed the title to our school. The challenge was tough but we managed to handle the pressure and here we are with the title.” The discipline’s co-founder Fredrick Obongi said they had to introduce the game to girls first because they are neglected in the major sporting disciplines in the country. He said: “Though we have introduced the sport to boys now, we started with girls to bring them closer to the boys who have dominated most disciplines.
