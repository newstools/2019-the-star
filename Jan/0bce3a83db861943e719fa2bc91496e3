Angry residents on Monday night barricaded the Mau Narok - Mwisho wa Lami road as they protested increased cases of insecurity in the area. This follows an attack on two men who were earlier attacked and slashed by unknown assailants. Police had to fire in the air to disperse the angry residents who had also lit bonfires. The two are nursing serious injuries at the Nakuru level five hospital. Area MCA Jackson Gathua said the attack happened when the two victims were returning to their homes from Muthera farm. Residents are now demanding police take action to curb the increasing incidences of thuggery and assaults. The MCA called on area residents to remain calm even as he urged security agencies to investigate the incident and prosecute those involved. The incident comes barely a week after similar violent confrontations were witnessed in Likia, a few kilometres away following the killing of a man who had gone to look for his stolen sheep.
