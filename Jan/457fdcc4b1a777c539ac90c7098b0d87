The handshake between ODM leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta is behind the problems facing Jubilee and DP William Ruto, Kuria East MP Marwa Kitayama has said. He accused Raila of not being honest about the handshake and said he is using it to scuttle Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. “The handshake has a hand in this. It will be dishonest for any Kenyan not to realise that the entry of Raila in the government has led to wrangles in Jubilee. It is a fact,” Kitayama said on Tuesday. Kitayama spoke during an education function in Kegonga, Kuria East. He said Uhuru and Raila should unpack the handshake to all Kenyans as it is not just about the two.
