The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the election of Embakasi East MP Babu Owino. Judges said the Court of Appeal did not act in excess of it's jurisdiction. The court said the violence did not affect the outcome of the final results. The said violence at the tallying centre cannot render the elections a sham, the judges said. Embakasi East MP loser Francis Mureithi appealed the decision upholding Owino's win in the August 2017 election. This was after the Court of Appeal ordered him to pay Sh3 million in costs of the case filed by his opponent. Mureithi told journalists that he is consulting with his lawyers before making the next move after losing the petition.
