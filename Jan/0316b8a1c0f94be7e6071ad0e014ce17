The Nairobi county assembly Public Accounts Committee has faulted executives for snubbing an invite. Substantive Finance Allan Igambi and acting chief officer Winfred Kathangu had been summoned to appear before the committee, chaired by Wilfred Odallo, on Wednesday. However, Odallo, who is also the Mabatini MCA, said he received a letter from the executive’s office 10 minutes before the meeting was to start and was forced to adjourn it. “Members I agree with all your sentiments and as you aware the consideration of the Auditor general report by the assembly has timelines,” Odallo said. The committee pointed out that the reshuffle of Sonko’s Cabinet had nothing to with the functions of the committee and the executives should attend when invited. In a letter dated January 15, PAC had also invited the CEC and the Chief Officer to appear before the committee which is examining the report of the Auditor General on financial statements for the Executive for the year ended June 30, 2017. The objective of the meeting was to allow the Executive to respond to audit queries raised in the report. The queries include inaccuracies in the financial statements, pending accounts receivables, cash and equivalents and revenue management. “I direct that these officers - one CEC member for Finance and the chief officer for Finance to appear before this committee on Thursday at 2.30pm without failure,” Odallo said. He further said that if the county officials fail to appear, the committee shall invoke the provision of the law on summons. Click here for the latest political news
