A nurse in Arizona has been charged with sexual assault after a vulnerable patient under his care gave birth. The suspect has been named as Nathan Sutherland, 36, who worked at the Hacienda Healthcare clinic. The 29-year-old patient, who has reportedly been in the care of the clinic since she was a toddler, gave birth on 29 December. Staff at the facility said at the time that they were unaware she was pregnant until she went into labour. The child, a boy, is now in the care of the patient's family and is said to be doing well. "We can't always choose how we come into this life, but we as a community can choose to love this child," Police Sgt Tommy Thompson told reporters. Phoenix police chief Jeri Williams said Mr Sutherland was identified through "good old-fashioned police work". After the birth, an investigation was launched into sexual assault because the woman's condition renders her unable to give consent. Sutherland submitted a DNA sample under a court order. A test showed his DNA positively matched with the child. He has been charged with one count of sexual assault and one count of abusing a vulnerable adult. "We owed this arrest to the victim," Chief Williams said. "We owed this arrest to the newest member of our community, that innocent baby." Click here for the latest political news
