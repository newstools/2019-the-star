Beneficiaries of Equity Bank’s scholarship programme in Kirinyaga county have been urged to maintain discipline and hard work as they join Form One since they are the bank’s ambassadors. Kerugoya branch manager Simon Kanyingi warned that the bank will stop sponsoring any student who engages in indiscipline. He addressed the 24 beneficiaries of the Wings to Fly programme on Saturday. ‘’You are our ambassadors, hence we expect you to maintain discipline and hard work and we expect stellar performance from you. If you succumb to peer pressure and engage in acts of indiscipline then we will have no option but cease sponsoring you,’’ Kanyingi said. The banker said 402 students from Kirinyaga county have benefited from the programme since its inception in 2010. He said the bank considers only vulnerable cases and sponsors them fully from pocket money, personal effects to school fees. ‘’You are not going to pay a penny. We are going to provide you with everything including fare to schools so that you have a conducive environment to learn,’’ he said. Pupils who scored over 350 marks were considered. “We have cases where a pupil who scored 280 marks in KCPE ended up surprising everyone after she scored an A-minus in last years KCSE. So you have room to improve.’’
