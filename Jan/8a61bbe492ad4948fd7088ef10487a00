National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale has said reports of divisions within the Jubilee party are “untrue”. Leaders of the ruling party have in the past week been hitting out at each other. Allies of President Uhuru Kenyatta and those of Deputy President William Ruto have accused each other of undermining the other. Speaking during a funds drive for Islamic schools in Bura constituency on Saturday, Duale said the party remains united. He said the relationship among the President, DP and party leaders is intact. The Majority leader is a close ally of the two and staunch defender both inside and outside Parliament. He said, however, that remarks by politicians were a threat to national unity. He was referring to Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria’s comments that the President has marginalised Central Kenya by denying its counties national government projects. Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri led supporters in Nakuru to demonstrate against the President’s ‘washenzi’ label of leaders who accused a him of neglecting the region. It voted overwhelmingly for him in the 2017 General Election. Duale said it was important that leaders “behave themselves and watch their remarks lest they plunge the county to chaos.” “The President is the symbol of unity to our country and was elected by all Kenyans. He should be respected and not be reduced to a village or tribal leader...,” Duale said. The Majority leader said the President will continue developing all parts of the country equally through equitable distribution of resources. Bura MP Ali Wario urged leaders to stop early campaigns and concentrate on delivering services to their electorates.
