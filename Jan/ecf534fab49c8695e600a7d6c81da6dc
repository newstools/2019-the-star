Former Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has urged the Kenya Revenue Authority to remove obstacles that stall economic growth. Kabogo on Thursday said there is too much bureaucracy at the agency. “Let KRA not burden Kenyans with heavy tax. Instead KRA is supposed to entice people by taxing them reasonably, especially startups," he said. “Given that this is the agency that collects taxes on behalf of the government, it can convincingly be argued KRA is the lifeline of Kenya’s economy. Put differently, your taxes which flow to the economy through the veins of KRA are the lifeline of Kenya’s economy." The remarks come in the wake of a plan by the KRA to block iTax defaulters from the import and export business. The taxman will roll out the plan in April, a move aimed at boosting compliance. The bid will be implemented through the Integrated Customs Management System and will connect to electronic tax-filing system iTax. Following the integration of the two systems, KRA will flag out tax cheats. KRA has established a vast network of stations within and outside cities and towns, including in far-flung areas like border points that offer personalised guidance without a fee.
