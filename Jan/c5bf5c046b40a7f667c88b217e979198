An eight-year-old girl in Kisumu, Kombewa subcounty, sustained injuries after her father allegedly set their house on fire on Monday morning. East Othany senior assistant chief Caleb Okuom told the Star the girl is admitted to Kombewa Sub-District Hospital. He said the girl's father, Stephen Ouma, had locked himself and his daughter in the house before setting it ablaze. Okuom said neighbours went to the scene and rescued the two upon hearing screams from the daughter. Then the man attempted to commit suicide by taking poison, but was intercepted and arrested. The suspect is being monitored by the police in the hospital. Click here for the latest political news
