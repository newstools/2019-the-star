KCB winger Jacob Ojee has expressed optimism upon his return to the national Sevens squad where he has been named the skipper. Ojee takes over from Eden Agero, who has joined the senior striking players over the contracts alongside Dennis Ombachi and Jeff Oluoch. Ojee’s first task will be to galvanise the young squad heading for the Hamilton and Sydney sevens legs later this month. Ojee was one of the six players called up to the squad last week following the contractual standoff between senior players and Kenya Rugby Union. He was delighted with the honour of being appointed captain for the side and is relishing the challenge. “Many don’t know that before I started playing for the Simbas, I played Sevens rugby. For the last one and half weeks, I have been trying to adapt and I am good to go,” said Ojee. Ojee last played for the Kenya Sevens side in 2014 under South African Paul Treu and said his long absence will not deter him from scaling the heights. “My body feels right and am ready to do the country proud and lead this young team to great heights when we go for the next two legs,” added Ojee. Ojee will be deputised by veteran Michael Wanjala of Homeboyz. Wanajala has had a distinguished career for the Sevens squad, having played at the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens and the 2014 Commonwealth Games as well as several legs of the circuit as a half back. Team: Jacob Ojee (captain), Michael Wanjala(vice captain,Homeboyz), Cyprian Kuto (Homeboyz), Vincent Onyala (KCB), Brian Wahinya (Blak Blad), Brian Wandera (Homeboyz), Daniel Taabu (Mwamba), Johnstone Olindi (Homeboyz), Bush Mwale (Homeboyz), William Reeve (Quins), Eliakim Kichoi (Mwamba), Harold Anduvate, (Oilers) Mark Wandetto (Homeboyz).
