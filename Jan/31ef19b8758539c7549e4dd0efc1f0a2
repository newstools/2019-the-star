Siaya residents are panicking over the outbreak of highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease. On Monday, the county closed Arram, Akala and Bondo markets to contain the disease. The viral disease is severe, affects cattle, sheep and goats, among others, and can be fatal. Humans usually recover in a week. The economic impact is severe. The interval between exposure to infection varies between 24 hours and 10 days, or longer. Airborne spread can occur if there’s wind. Symptoms include fever, blisters in the mouth and on feet, a drop in milk production, weight loss, appetite loss, quivering lips, frothing at the mouth and limping. Livestock will remain quarantined until they are vaccinated and sprayed. Agriculture and Livestock executive Charles Ogada said the exercise will start next week. “Laboratory tests of some samples were positive, prompting my office to close the markets,” he told farmers in Mbaga on Wednesday. Ogada urged livestock keepers to be on the lookout, report new cases and take advantage of the vaccination drive. Some animals in Kisumu county have exhibited similar symptoms.
