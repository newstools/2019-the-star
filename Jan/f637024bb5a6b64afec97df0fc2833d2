Kenya qualified for third place playoff after tying with the hosts in the Statehood Day women’s International Polo tournament held at Imphal grounds in Manipur State, India over the weekend. In an unfamiliar format, Pool ‘A’ sides Kenya and the Manipur State team, who tied on a point each will alongside Canada vie for position three. Both Kenya comprising of Rowena Stichbury, Hiromi Nzomo, Georgina Millar, Phyllipa Martian and Cheza Miller) and Manipur State featuring Thuodam Tanna, Newly Rik, Victoria Oinam, Khundongbam Have and Laishram Chanu, had lost to Argentina 7-3 and 3-5 respectively in the preliminaries before collecting a point apiece in their 7-7 tie. After bowing out of the title contention with a loss to Argentina, Kenya made changes with Georgina and Hiromi playing number one and two respectively (attacking roles), while Marrian and Rowena executed their defensive duties putting on three and four. Cheza, who played as the substitute, took the rotational rider role, moving from position four to one then back to defence (three). Hiromi held on to position two and played all the four chukkas to score a hat-trick. In their high scoring draw, Hiromi hit in a penalty shot before sending home a field goal for Kenya’s 0-2 lead in the opening chukka. Hiromi was then cut out as Tanna went on the rampage scoring three goals and Oinam added one to end the chukka 4-2.
