Counties should play a bigger role in fighting insecurity, government spokesperson Eric Kiraithe has said. Kiraithe yesterday said in Mombasa that while the national government invests billions of shillings in security, the efforts may come to naught if counties do not take their responsibilities seriously. The spokesman said CCTV coverage in Nairobi is a huge investment but it is yet to be used optimally. His comments follow a suspected improvised explosive device that went off outside Smothers Restaurant in Nairobi on Saturday injuring two people. Reports indicate the area was poorly lit as streetlights were not working. “When the streets lights are not working, you are denying Kenyans a service they seriously require, especially the service to eradicate crime,” Kiraithe said. Security agencies have developed strategies to counter insecurity, including the Nyumba Kumi initiative. The initiative has however been misunderstood by Kenyans, Kiraithe said. Kenyans perceive it as a government project which has little to do with them. “The concept of human rights presumes that in every area where people live they are the owners of that place. They should have control of what happens there, especially if it is likely to prejudice their rights,” Kiraithe said. He said radicalisation happens in communities because residents allow strangers in their midst. “Your right to privacy must be balanced with my right to security,” he said. He said criminal gangs are on the rise in Mombasa. “Mombasa is a beautiful city but in recent months we have heard reports of criminal gangs terrorising people,” he said.
