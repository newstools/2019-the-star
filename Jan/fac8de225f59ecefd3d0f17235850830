Football Kenya Federation (FKF) National Super League returnees Shabana will today look to end their two-game losing streak when they face Eldoret Youth in a mid-week clash. The encounter between the two promoted sides will be a tough one with both sides having lost their weekend fixtures. Shabana lost 2-1 against log leaders Ushuru while Eldoret Youth succumbed to a 2-0 loss against Wazito. Shabana assistant coach Andrew Kanuli said they are going to Eldoret for maximum points. “This is a derby of promoted sides. We are well prepared for the game and our target is a win. We have lost two consecutive matches which has not gone down well with the fans but we have rectified the areas where we made mistakes,” said Kanuli. Administration Police host league leaders Ushuru in the first double header set for Camp Toyoyo. AP are one of only four sides yet to taste defeat this season, having won twice and shared the spoils five times. They will come up against an Ushuru side that sit pretty at the top with 19 points from seven matches. The second match of the day will see FC Talanta take on Green Commandos at 4.15pm. Talanta are third with 16 points, only three shy of Ushuru and will hope to maintain a fine run against a Green Commandos side that has not won a match since their opening day win over Modern Coast Rangers. Second-placed Wazito will be up against Bidco United at the Thika Stadium.
