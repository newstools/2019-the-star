A clinical officer was last night shot dead by bandits along the Tot-Chesongoch road in Marakwet East. The deceased David Kipchumba Kipkore, 29, was riding on a motorbike with two others when they were sprayed bullets at Chemukutet near Kapkobil centre. He was a clinical officer at Chesongoch Mission Hospital. Marakwet East police boss Vincent Kitili said another passenger Julius Kilonzo sustained gunshot wounds on the leg while the rider Titus Kibet, 23, escaped unhurt. "The attack took place last night and we have deployed officers to pursue those involved," said Kitili. The body has been moved to Tot Sub County Hospital mortuary.

Tension is high in the area as police are patrolling most routes. The attack is suspected to have happened in the wake of an ultimatum issued by a section of elders in Tiaty who asked for a return of 82 cattle they claimed were stolen by the Marakwet through Kotuut location.
