The government has extended the reporting deadline for Form One to Friday, January 18, to ensure all students report to their respective schools. In a circular to county education officials on Friday, Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang said school principals and parents had made the request. "To ensure 100 per cent transition is attained, and the need to give every child an opportunity, the Ministry of Education has extended the reporting date," Kipsang said. The circular was copied to regional coordinators of education, county directors of education and subcounty directors of education. Friday, January 11, was the initial deadline for all Form One students to report to their schools.

Kipsang said the provision for details of students to be captured only in the National Educational Management Information System (Nemis) still stands and must be adhered to by all school principals. "All schools, both private and public, are directed to upload all admitted students into Nemis system immediately," the PS said. The ministry recently backed down and allowed school heads to admit students that had not been initially selected to join their schools provided details of the same are contained in Nemis. Kipsang asked the county officials to help private and subcounty schools to capture student details in the system.
