The politics of the past few weeks has alarmingly raised political temperature to boiling point, even before the year is a week old. And it's all to do with succession politics. Last weekend we had Jubilee vice-chairman David Murathe claiming that Deputy President William Ruto is constitutionally barred from vying for the country's top job come 2022. A few days earlier he had told the DP  not to  count on the support of Central Kenya after President Uhuru Kenyatta's 10-year tenancy at State House ends. Political observers across the country and more so in the Rift Valley are keenly following the utterances of this man. Not because he is David Murathe but because he is a right-hand man of the President. To them - rightly or wrongly - whatever he says is a rehash of what has been discussed elsewhere. Why is this coming so soon after Ruto's repeated admonishment for his kutangatanga politics? This country needs sobriety more than anything else at a time when there are so many challenges that demand the total concentration of our collective leadership. The Murathes of this world are a distraction we are better of without.
