Tana River governor Dhadho Godhana has asked the government to repatriate all Somali refugees “as they are a security threat”. Dhadho on Thursday said Somalia was peaceful and that it was time for the refugees to return and build their country. “Somali refugees should return to their country and rebuild it. There is peace there (in Somalia),” the governor said. He spoke in Hola during the handing over of bursary cheques. He condemned the Tuesday terror attack at the DusitD2 Hotel in Nairobi. Dhadho said KDF who are fighting al-Shabaab under the African Mission in Somalia have helped to restore peace. He asked citizens to take advantage of the peace and build working institutions. “Somalia has a governance system like Kenya and citizens are free to vie for elective positions like that of governor and MP. The refugees should return because they can’t run for elective posts here,” Dhadho said. The govenor said he was not against refugees but that it was time they returned home.
