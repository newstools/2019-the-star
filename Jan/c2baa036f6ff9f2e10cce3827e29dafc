Confusion reigned at Mufungu village in Sirisia on Saturday when some mourners attempted to block Bungoma politician Moses Nandalwe from attending a funeral. Trouble started when "Mr Money Bags" arrived for the funeral of three children of AC Butonge Secondary School principal Vincent Wekesa. Supporters of Sirisia MP John Waluke tried to prevent Nandalwa from accessing the funeral venue. 'Mr Money Bags' contested the Sirisia seat in 2017 on the ODM ticket and lost to Waluke of Jubilee. Nandalwe, who arrived with his supporters shortly before the service, forced his way through. During the commotion, 'Mr Money Bags' was hit on the face and got bruised. His fly whisk and walking stick were snatched and broken. The chaos happened as Waluke watched a few meters away.
