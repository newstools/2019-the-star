Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has declared he will take a stab at the Presidency. Speaking on Friday while presiding over the issuance of Bursary cheques worth Sh36 million to 1,800 students at Busia Agricultural Training Centre, the governor said people will be shocked in the near future to see him climb the ladder. He defended his move to hold talks with President Uhuru Kenyatta, deputy president William Ruto, and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga saying they are all his friends. “I am going to national politics. When you see me going to see Ruto or Raila it’s not that I am supporting them, I am also looking to be the President of Kenya. When you see me talking to Uhuru Kenyatta I also want to be President because his term is ending," Ojaamong said. "I've to talk to all my friends and God is big and my God listens to me. Mutashangaa hivi karibu (you will be shocked in the near future) how I will go up.” In early November 2018, the President said he would be at the centre of succession politics towards the end of his final term and people will be shocked at his choice of successor for 2022. “They think because Uhuru is going home in 2022, he will not have a word on what will happen. I am telling them when the right time comes, I will have something to say,” the President told a rally in Nyeri town. He added, “Some think I have kept quiet because I am not capable of taking politics. I am still a politician. They will be shocked when that time comes, but for now, I want to concentrate on delivering my pledges to Kenyans.” Click here for the latest political news
