Kwale governor Salim Mvurya could not have been elected the Council of Governors chairperson because he lacks CoG’s trust, Taita Taveta boss has said. “CoG had an issue with Mvurya becoming the chairperson of the council,” Granton Samboja said yesterday in Mombasa but did not elaborate. Samboja said there was a deal on December 2017 that Mvurya leads the council and be deputized by Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru.“It was to mature after six months. But shall we keep looking at the past or future?” he posed. Talks to have next leadership negotiated was aimed at holding the country together, he said. The March 9, 2018 handshake quelled disruptions and the deal became insignificant. By June 2018, Mvurya was to take the helm of CoG from Josphat Nanok according to the agreement. The Kwale boss did not take part in the January 14 vote that saw Kakamega’s Wycliff Oparanya voted in. Samboja said Mvurya’s absence also contributed to his sideline. He said Oparanya’s election was free and fair. “This put to question the integrity of the council,” Mvurya told journalists at his office.The DP’s right-hand man has been sending mixed signals over his stand on the vote.
