Fourteen traders were rescued by fishermen after an overloaded boat capsized on Lake Victoria on Monday. Nobody was hurt. They were transporting cereals from an island in Uganda to Mulukoba beach in Port Victoria town, Busia. The traders said on Tuesday that strong wind rocked the boat at 9.30am. They spoke to the Star at Mulukoba beach. One trader said they lost 14 sacks of cassava flour, a sack of maize, 40 litres of fresh milk, 20 crates of tomatoes and other items. “We started our journey smoothly but when we reached in the middle of the lake, strong wind hit our boat and it was filled with water. We unsuccessfully attempted to bail water from the boat to keep it afloat,” a survivor said.
