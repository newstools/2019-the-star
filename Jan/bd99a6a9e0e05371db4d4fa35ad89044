Muslims in Lamu are angered by the recent Supreme Court ruling barring girls from wearing hijab in non-Muslim schools. Hijab is a headscarf worn by Muslim girls and women. It covers the head and chest. The Lamu Muslims Association, cultural organisations and activist groups in Lamu yesterday called the ruling “provocative and demeaning to the Islamic faith”. They spoke in Lamu town. The groups said the decision was not only unfair, but also a direct violation of the Constitution, which provides for freedom of worship. Lamu Cultural Promotional Group chairperson Ghalib Alwy said the hijab signifies a serious cultural commitment for Muslim women. He said the garment cannot be forcibly removed, unless by the willful decision of the person wearing it, usually in the privacy of their homes. “It’s not just a piece of cloth as it carries a heavy religious connotation. It has never happened and definitely won’t happen,” Alwy said. Giving schools power to decide, he said, will open doors for students from certain religious backgrounds to be openly frustrated. Lamu Muslims Association representative Hussein Miji said the ruling undermines the rights of Muslims for no apparent reason. He said the ruling should also apply to Christian students enrolling in non-Christian schools to be compelled to wear hijabs. “The Constitution provides for freedom of worship. That amounts to respect of people’s religious practices and beliefs. I still can’t fathom how a whole [ 4-1 ] Supreme Court can make such a ruling,” Miji said. Save Lamu chairperson Mohamed Abubakar urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene and provide direction. He said such “reckless” rulings can easily disrupt peace and cohesion among religious communities.
