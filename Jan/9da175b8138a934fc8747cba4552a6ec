Kisumu governor Anyang’ Nyong’o was discharged from Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi, yesterday. Senior county officials who visited him said was in good health. He left the hospital in the morning. They said the governor is in better health and will resume his daily duties. “Actually, he was to be discharged on Wednesday,” an official said. On Wednesday, several leaders, Deputy President William Ruto, visited him at the facility. Others were ODM leader Raila Odinga, governors Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega) and Mwangi wa Iria (Murang’a), Kisumu deputy governor Mathews Owili, Alego-Usonga MP Samuel Atandi and MCAs. “[I’m] pleased that he is responding well to treatment and wished him a speedy and full recovery,” Ruto said on his Facebook page. Nyong’o was rushed to Aga Khan Hospital in Kisumu on Saturday after falling ill at Uzima University grounds during the installation of Rev Philip Anyolo the new head of Kisumu Catholic Archdiocese. His press unit said he excused himself to seek medical attention following discomfort. Nyong’o was, however, flown to Nairobi for treatment on Sunday despite denial from his press unit.

His press team said he was in Nairobi for the Monday election of CoG’s new officials. He did not attend the meet. He had expressed interest in the chairman’s post. Oparanya was elected to the position, with Iria as the vice chairman. On Sunday, there had been claims on social media that Nyong’o was flown out of the country for specialised care. But county officials denied reports. Aloice Ager, the Governor Press Unit director, said the reports were untrue and malicious. “We’ve seen all sorts of reports on social media that the governor has been taken out of the country for treatment. Such information is false and should be dismissed,” Ager told the Star. Click here for the latest political news
