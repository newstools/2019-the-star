One police officer has died on the spot and four others sustained injuries after a trailer rammed into a police van along the busy Bungoma-Eldoret highway. The accident occurred at Manga area shortly before Monday midnight. The deceased, Constable Everyne Akoth was ejected from the police van and fell on the tarmac. She sustained serious head injuries and succumbed shortly thereafter. A report booked at the Lumakanda police station indicates that both the police land cruiser and the truck were headed towards the same direction at the time of the accident. The report indicated the driver of the truck rammed into the police van from behind. "This forced the cruiser to tumble over thereby ejecting the deceased who fell on the tarmac and died," the report said. The truck driver Mohammed Abdi Giat was arrested and is being held at Lumakanda police station. Unconfirmed reports indicate that the officers attempted to stop the truck driver but he ignored them. This forced the officers to speed past the truck and block the road with the police van. The truck in stead rammed into it. The other occupants of the police land cruiser were rushed to Lumakanda sub county hospital where they were treated and discharged. They were identified as constables Isaya Ogada who suffered back injuries and Samuel Wanyama who sustained deep forehead cuts. They were referred both to the Moon Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret for specialised treatment. Others were Patrick Oluoch and Enock Angoya who suffered chest injuries and were treated and discharged.
