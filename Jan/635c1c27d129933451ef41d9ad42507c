A student who had been turned away from Starehe Boys Centre during Form One admission will now join Mang’u Boys. Jack Mutuma Mbabu scored 417 marks in last year’s Kenya Certificate for Primary Education examinations. Speaking at St Mary's High School in Nakuru on Monday, Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed said the ministry intervened to ensure the boy gets a school. "The issue has been resolved and the boy will be joining Mang'u," she said. Starehe Boys Centre acting director Josphat Mwaura was quoted as saying the boy was denied admission because he had not been selected to join the school. He, however, said he was among 24 students recommended for consideration by the ministry. The school also accused the boy’s father of behaving inappropriately and failing to follow admission procedures. Amina said Form One transition currently stands at 83 per cent nationwide. She said the ministry is working to ensure 100 per cent transition as announced by President Kenyatta. The CS also said the ministry is working round the clock to improve infrastructure to decongest schools. Click here for the latest political news
