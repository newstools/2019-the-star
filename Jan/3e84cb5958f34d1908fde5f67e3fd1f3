Only five universities had established career offices against a December 2018 deadline set by the Ministry of Education. In June last year, all universities and tertiary institutions in the country were asked to establish offices of career services. This was the first directive CS Amina Mohamed made when she was appointed the education boss. The five universities that have so far complied are University of Nairobi, United States International University, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Strathmore University and Kimathi University. The office of career services will seek to empower students to make right career choices in 73 universities and 200 tertiary institutions across the country. The programme rollout started on July 1 and full establishment and operationalisation was to begin in September and the exercise was to be put to halt by December 31. Speaking at the Kenya Education Management Institute during the opening of a training session of officers to work in this offices, the CS attributed the shortfall to lack of proper training of officers to take charge. “I am told that the reason only five universities have opened career offices despite a deadline is because we had no training, I am hoping that by the end of this training we will see more universities opening this offices,” Amina said yesterday.
