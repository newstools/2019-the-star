Africa Nouveau 2019 will be held in March this year. Themed 'Africans and Outer World Beings', a visual introduction to the theme is presented as a seven-minute short film on the festival’s YouTube channel. ‘Outer World’ is written by award-winning filmmaker Wanuri Kahiu and features two exceptional Kenyan actors, Joyce Maina and Nick Ndenda. The story follows an ordinary Kenyan couple, whose regular day is dramatically interrupted when they are visited by an outer world being, who communicates to them via telepathy, instructing them to remember and reclaim their true selves, buried in their ancient history. Since 2015, Africa Nouveau has been a trailblazing, barrier-breaking music and arts festival congregating creators, curators and fans of African cool from all over Africa and the diaspora.
