Nyamira governor John Nyagarama has made changes in his cabinet to improve services. In a statement to the media on Tuesday evening, Johnstone Obike has been moved from Public Service Management to the department of Trade industry, Tourism and Cooperative development. Benard Osumo has been moved from Gender Culture and Youth empowerment to Public Service Management. Nyagarama said the changes take effect immediately. The reshuffle comes days after residents complained of underperformance in county departments. Top county officials have been having difficulties with the county assembly over poor coordination of projects. At some point, MCAs pointed an accusing finger at the executive over poor development. Residents have blamed county executive members for poor services and demanded change. The Finance docket remains vacant following the resignation of county executive member Jackline Kemunto late last year. Click here for the latest political news
