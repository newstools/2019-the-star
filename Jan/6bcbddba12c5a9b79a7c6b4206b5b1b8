It will be a Kenyan affair in the final of the third edition of the SportPesa Cup as Kariobangi Sharks and Bandari knocked out their respective hosts in Dar es Salaam yesterday. In the first semi, Bandari came from behind to beat Simba 2-1 while Sharks survived a nervy penalty shoot out to beat Mbao FC 6-5 and reach the final in their first year of asking. Sharks coach William Muluya said reaching the final is a major steps but the job is not yet over since they will be facing off with an equally ambitious side. The two are the only unbeaten sides in the Kenyan Premier League. “I am not thinking about the Everton friendly. All my energy and thoughts are in the final and I believe the team which will prepare well will carry the day,” said Muluya. The SportPesa Shield Cup holders, who dominated the opening half were guilty not to break for the breather with at least three goals as Harrison Mwendwa, Duke Abuya and George Abege fluffed open chances. Sharks scored their penalties through Tom Teka, Sven Yidah, Geoffrey Lemu, Nickson Omondi,Erick Juma and Michael Bodo. Patillah Omoto had his opening penalty saved. Mbao on the other hand scored through Said Khamis, Abubakari Ngalema, Vincent Philiph,David Mwasa and Erick Mulilio. The duo of Hamimu Adbukarim and Amos Charles watched their kicks bounce off the bar. Bandari coach Bernard Mwalala said: “I told the boys this is the shortcut to play in Europe since the winner of the tournament will play Everton. It was the force behind us today and our sole motive in the tournament. I had told them not be scared of the atmosphere and I am happy with their composure. We attacked and created chances and I believe we will also have a good game in the finals.” Playing under intense humidity,the opening half was headed for a goalless score but redhot Meddie Kagere punished Bandari’s 46th minute defensive mix-up to fire home the opening goal.
