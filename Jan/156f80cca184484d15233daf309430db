Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata is such a fan of reggae, he has named his second child after popular Jamaican reggae group Morgan Heritage. "I named my second child Euna Morgan," he told Word Is yesterday. Kang'ata says he grew up listening to reggae music and even became a DJ, and most of his county people knew him for that. "While in university I was suspended after opposing the parallel degree programme. I became a DJ just to keep me going while out of school. I used to be called DJ Nyutu in Murang'a for two years," he said. Kang'ata says he grew up listening to reggae music because most of it talks about real-life issues. "'How Comes' is one of Morgan Heritage's songs that really inspire people because they are highlighting challenges people go through in life. Why the youth in the ghetto don't get the education like those in urban areas," he says. "I love most of their songs because they touch a lot about family. I sing it to my wife just to encourage her because I am busy with politics, I still have to create time for my family. I love reggae but I think I love Morgan Heritage's songs more because of the message they have." Kang'ata has worked hand in hand with artistes from Murang'a county to help them succeed.
