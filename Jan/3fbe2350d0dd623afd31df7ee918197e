The budget-making process for the financial year 2019/2020 has started and the Treasury is inviting the public and stakeholders to give their views. Treasury Principal Secretary Kamau Thugge said the department has finalised the preparation of a draft budget policy statement. The Public Finance Management Act requires the Treasury to seek the input of the stakeholders and the public while drafting the policy statement before submitting the final document to the Cabinet. Once the Cabinet approves the proposal in the draft policy statement, the Treasury submits it to Parliament through the National Assembly's Budget committee. The committee is chaired by Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung'wah. In an advert in one of the dailies, the PS invited stakeholders to comment on the draft statement. Among the stakeholders expected to submit their views by January 25 include the Commission on Revenue Allocation, the Controller of Budget, and Parliamentary Service Commission. Others are county governments, the Judicial Service Commission, the public and any other groups. Also read: Inside the Sh3 trillion 2018/19 budget Click here for the latest political news
