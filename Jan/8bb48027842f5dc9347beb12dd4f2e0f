The Supreme Court has overturned a Court of Appeal decision that nullified the election of Kabuchai MP James Lusweti. The court on Wednesday ruled that Lusweti was validly elected in the August 2017 election. The Court of Appeal judges had ordered the IEBC to conduct a fresh election in Kabuchai after the successful petition by his rival Tale Nabangi, who ran as an Independent. This is after the High Court in Bungoma dismissed Nabangi's petition challenging his winÂ in March last year.
