George Owiti / Nursery pupils in a public primary school in Mavoko, Machakos, are taking lessons in the open. The 41 learners at Seme Primary School sit on stones outside the classroom. Head teacher Antony Ngatia yesterday told the Star the school had no choice but to teach the children in the open after their old mabati classroomâ€™s condition deteriorated and was condemned. Ngatia said children fall sick as a result of being exposed to extreme weather conditions. They are also affected by dust from nearby quarries and they get distracted. Ngatia said the school established in 2012 by the Mavoko CDF has only four permanent classrooms. The school does not have an administration block or staffroom. He said the four permanent classrooms have been temporarily partitioned to four classrooms each to accommodate children from Standard One to Eight.
