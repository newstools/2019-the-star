Eight counties in the North Rift have agreed to initiate joint projects that will help to end banditry in Kerio Valley. The projects in agriculture, water and infrastructure are expected to transform the lives of pastoralists. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago said the projects will be initiated through the North Rift Economic Bloc (Noreb). It includes Uasin Gishu, Nandi, Trans Nzoia, Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot, Turkana Baringo and Samburu counties. The counties will also revive more than 100 projects stalled in the Kerio Valley because of insecurity. Six of the counties are affected by banditry. Mandago was speaking in Eldoret at the end of a Noreb forum in which county leaders discussed a new national government policy on formation of regional economic blocs. The counties are also partnering with the UK to revive its activities and investment in the planned projects. “The agenda of the partnership with Britain includes resource mapping and coming up with trade policies to make the region economically vibrant,” Mandago said. He added, “We are brainstorming on coming up with projects along the Kerio Valley to end cattle rustling.” He said they have proposed providing water for pastoralist communities. Devolution PS Charles Sunkuli said the state is already seeking the inputs of counties on the new policy. A number of counties have formed economic blocs, such as the North Rift Economic Bloc and Lake Region Economic Bloc. Sunkuli said the blocs will spur economic growth and benefit many people. Elgeyo Marakwet governor Alex Tolgos was also present.
