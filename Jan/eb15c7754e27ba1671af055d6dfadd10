Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju has been told to get out of the comfort zone and vie for Siaya Governor in 2022. Vice chairman David Murathe on Saturday said the former Rarieda MP is a manager and the county requires a man of his traits. He told Tuju not to fear Siaya senator James Orengo, who has been linked to the seat. "Na vile wewe unaogopa Orengo, wacha kuogopa Orengo. [The way you fear Orengo, stop fearing him]. He is a politician and not a technocrat. Orengo has no time to be a manager," Murathe said. He spoke during the burial of Tuju's younger brother, Kefa Oduor, at Ralingo village in Rarieda. "Orengo should go for the presidency and not the Governor. Mbona tunataka kusumbua yeye. [Why do we want to disturb him?]" Murathe said. "If Raila [Odinga] and Uhuru [Kenyatta] will not be vying 2022, then Siaya can as well produce a presidential candidate. Is there a problem with that?" ODM chairman John Mbadi, in his address, said Siaya needs a Governor who has been in the struggle for reforms in the country. But Murathe, who has been in the limelight for advocating for the retirement of Deputy President William Ruto, said Tuju should not be cowed by that.

Tuju, who is a Cabinet Secretary without portfolio, said is ready to partner with other leaders to foster development in the region. "I want to assure all that Tuju does not intend to be the Governor of Siaya. I don’t have such dreams. I will support whoever the people of Siaya elect," he said. Tuju reiterated that residents should not mistake his quest for development for an ambition to seek an elective position in 2022.
