The Jubilee Party will not field candidates for the forthcoming by-elections in Ugenya and Embakasi South Constituencies. Party Secretary-General Raphael Tuju in a statement on Friday evening said the decision was arrived at after lengthy consultations by its leadership. "This is in the spirit of furthering the steps of constructive engagements with the other main parties engaged in the contest and with an eye on the bigger picture," Tuju said in the statement. He added that the Party is acting in the best interest of various initiatives that will reduce political tension in the country after a very divisive electoral period a year ago. "We urge all involved in the forthcoming political contests to exhibit maturity and decorum and ensure maintenance of peace," he said. The IEBC has announced the by-elections for Embakasi South and Ugenya constituencies will be conducted on April 5. The Embakasi East constituency was declared vacant by the Supreme Court that nullified Wiper Party’s Julius Mawathe win. The court nullified the election on December 21 last year on grounds there was no evidence to support the results the IEBC used to declare Mawathe winner. The petition was filed by former MP (ODM) Irshad Sumra.
