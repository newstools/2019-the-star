Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti will on Thursday next week know his fate in a case challenging his election. Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court Daniel Keiwua said the verdict will be read out from 9 am on February 6. Awiti moved to the Supreme Court after Appeal judges upheld an earlier judgment of the High Court that had established that the IEBC failed to conduct a free and fair poll. Awiti's main challenger Oyugi Magwanga, former Kasipul Kabondo MP, had lodged an appeal against Awiti's win in the High Court alleging that the elections were marred with irregularities.
