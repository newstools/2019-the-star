Deputy President William Ruto has denied that the Mau Forest evictions undertaken by the government last year was targeted at a particular community. Ruto said the conservation of the environment does not involve a particular tribe but is for all Kenyans. He was speaking on Saturday during the burial of politician Samuel Koriata in Narropil, Narok county. “As government, we know the importance of Mau Forest and water towers in all the places and we have elaborate plans to ensure that these problems are solved once and for all,” Ruto said. The DP said the government ordered the removal of 2,500 people who had settled beyond the forest cutline. “I am conversant with environment issues and we know the negative impact that will affect millions of people depended on it.” Click here for the latest political news
