Three Ukambani governors Alfred Mutua, Charity Ngilu and Kivutha Kibwana on Wednesday vowed to forge a common front to unite the community before the 2022 election. At the same time, the county chiefs invited Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to join their initiative and help fight poverty. While appreciating that they were all presidential material with enormous experience in public service, however, they said they have to prioritise developing their respective counties. Speaking at a rally in Masinga town, Machakos, the governors said they were not out to bash Kalonzo. They said it is about time he tamed his belligerent MCAs in Ukambani. Machakos governor Mutua, who is also the Maendeleo Chap Chap leader, reiterated that he is ready to contest the top seat after President Uhuru Kenyatta completes his term. The governors defended Uhuru in his fight against grand corruption and his quest for equitable distribution of development. Mutua said they supported the "handshakes" between leaders, but wananchi should be wary of fake leaders who were doing it for their personal benefit. Makueni governor Kibwana, who is also the Wiper chairman, asked Kalonzo to call party elections as he had served as acting chair for more than a year "and he is not comfortable". Kitui governor Ngilu said she ran for President in 1997 and has enormous experience in national politics. She urged the community to tread carefully before reaching a decision on who to front or support. Mavoko MP and Wiper diehard Patrick Makau said he will speak to his party boss on the complaint about MCAs. MPs Charles Kilonzo (Yatta), Vincent Musyoka ( Mwala) and Machakos Woman Representative Joyce Kamene were present. Click here for the latest political news
