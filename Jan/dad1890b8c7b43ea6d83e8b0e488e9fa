Good Morning About 3,000 foreigners have been deported from the country since May last year, in one of the boldest crackdowns aimed at streamlining the corruption-prone process of issuing work and staying permits in the country. Detectives from DCI's office and immigration officers involved in crackdown exercise since mid last year said so far the Government has deported the illegal immigrants after an investigation exposed the dirty tricks they used to gain entry into the country. Here are the stories making headlines in the Weekend Star this Saturday morning. _____________________________________________________ Uhuru Mt Kenya succession battle hots up In exactly three years and eight months, President Uhuru Kenyatta will walk out of State House having completed his constitutional two  five-year terms. Because of his impending exist politicians from his central Kenya region are quietly but intensely positioning themselves to succeed him in the populous region. There is a growing concern among the Mt Kenya leadership over what they say is hestitation by Uhuru to identify his heir who can lead the community's negotiations as 2022 succession politics takes shape. _____________________________________________________ Kilifi mentally retarded girl wins golden glove award at Special Olympics A mentally retarded girl from Kilifi County has won an international award in the Global special Olympics games held in Chicago USA late last year. Mitchel Mapenzi 18 who completed Standard 8 after learning at the Konjora primary school in Kibarani ward Kilifi for mental health students special unit won the medal for her extra performance in saving goals for her team during the tournament held in July last year. Her soccer team of integrated players (both mental ill and normal) from Kilifi County emerged fourth out of the eight teams which played but she was recognized as the best goal keeper in the tournament held between July 17 and 21. _____________________________________________________ Is Murathe speaking what Uhuru Kenyatta is saying?

Many people believe, and I think correctly, that he is effectively the power behind the throne — the Mayor of the Palace in a manner of speaking. _____________________________________________________ Is 2022 about Useful Idiots or Inner Circle Confidants? Useful Idiot is a term used in political discourse to describe a person who is a susceptible propagandist for a cause or purpose whose goals they are not entirely aware of, and are used cynically by the leaders of the cause.
