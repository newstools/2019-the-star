Kilifi governor Amason Kingi yesterday launched the Kilifi County Microfinance Fund popularly known as Mbegu Fund. He disbursed Sh30 million to groups of youths, women and people living with disability. Beneficiaries get the cash in form of interest-free loans. “This is a revolving fund, with its initial capital being the money allocated by the county executive and approved by the county assembly. It aims to empower small and medium entrepreneurs registered with the Kilifi county government,” Kingi said. From the next budget, the county will allocate 1 per cent to the fund. This will translate into at least Sh120 million annually. “Access to finance remains the biggest obstacle to firms trying to formalise, grow and increase productivity, thus the need for this fund,” the county chief said. Groups undergo training after their applications are accepted so they learn how to manage the cash and run their businesses successfully. “Groups apply through their respective subcounties and then successful applications are forwarded to the fund board for consideration,” Trade executive Nahida Mohamed said. Fund board chairman Pastus Kiti said evaluation and issuance of the funds is aboveboard and urged residents to take advantage and improve their lives. “Groups that follow the rules will benefit. We want to see our people change from this fund,” he said. The county will seek EACC services to avert fraud. “We have lost money to fraud in the Scholarship Fund. We don’t want to see that in Mbegu Fund,” Kingi said.
