Gospel mix master DJ Mo has opened up on how he coped after his wife Size 8 lost their unborn child through a miscarriage last year. "My wife was five weeks pregnant before the miscarriage," DJ Mo told Word Is on Friday. However, Mo says it is hard to understand what the problem was. "Miscarriage can be caused by so many things, like stress. Others may fail to adjust with the body, but we are doing well. If you love each other, that is a small thing. All you need is to encourage each other and it passes," Mo said. A few weeks before, there were speculations that Size 8 was pregnant. Fans sent her congratulatory message on photos she posted with a baby bump showing. "I will not deny nor confirm, but let us wait and see, time will tell," she said in an interview with Word Is. Well, the singer came out and announced that she was indeed pregnant but she lost the baby, and has gone through a lot of pain following the miscarriage. “Rumours were in many blogs that I was pregnant but I never did really confirm it because it was a battle all the way, so I just wanted to go with the fight privately. But God decided the best lane for me and I lost the pregnancy juzi. To be honest I’ve cried and asked God so many questions. I have given my husband stress. He is trying to make me be okay,” Size 8 said. DJ Mo said his wife is fine and already back to work.
