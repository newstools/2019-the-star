A total of 176, 282 teachers are actively involved in the implementation of the competency-based curriculum in Early Year Education, CS Amina Mohammed has said. She said the teachers were trained during school holidays between December 2017 and December 2018 ahead of the national rollout of the 2-6-3-3-3 curriculum in January. The new system is being implemented from Pre-primary 1 to Grade 3. While appearing before the Parliamentary Committee on Education on Thursday, Amina said the number of trained instructors includes 96, 522 teachers and head teachers and 79,760 pre-primary tutors from public and private schools. “We will continue training more teachers as we roll-out and are in discussions with teacher training colleges and Universities to review their curricula to train for CBC delivery,” Amina said. She said 74 national trainers, 507 master trainers, 47 County Directors of Education in-charge of EDC, and 3,360 trainers of teachers and 30 KICD subject specialists were involved in the training. They were drawn from the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development, the Centre for Mathematics, Science and Technology Education in Africa (CEMASTEA), Kenya Education Management Institute, and Kenya Institute of Special Education (KISE). The new curriculum will be gradually implemented over the coming years until the 8-4-4 system is phased out by 2027. The last batch of students will sit KCPE exams in 2023 while the last KCSE exam will be held in 2027. “In 2028, the first cohort of CBE completes Basic Education at G12 and will be ready to proceed to tertiary education,” Amina said. KICD approved 305 textbooks for use from pre-primary 1 to Grade 3. Amina said 12.75 million of the books have so far been distributed to schools. Click here for the latest political news
