Ongea! 2019 will feature 32 showcases from different artistes given 25 minutes each over the four days of the summit. Peter Astedt will select at least one of the showcasers to go perform at Live at Heart festival in Orebro, Sweden, with all expenses catered for, on their 10th anniversary from September 4-7.
