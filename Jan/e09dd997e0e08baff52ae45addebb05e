An ODM national leader has dismissed critics who want party leader Raila Odinga to retire on account of his age. “We want Raila to be on the ballot (in 2022 ). We are very confident that he will win the seat again like he has ‘won’ before,” party treasurer Timothy Bosire said. Bosire praised Raila for his stellar role in shaping the country’s politics. The former Kitutu Masaba MP claimed that the ODM leader is still young and has a lot to contribute to the country. “Raila has selflessly suffered and sacrificed for Kenya. It is our desire that he becomes the President of this country,” he said during a tour of the constituency. “Malaysia’s Prime Minister Mahatir Mohammed is 93 years. He came from retirement to shape the destiny of the country after years of economic mismanagement,” stated the former MP. Raila is keeping people guessing on whether he will contest the presidency again in 2022. The former prime minister said in Bondo recently that he is not a candidate in the next elections. “I have not said I will run again in 2022. People should give me a break,” he said adding that he will make his decision at the right time. He spoke at Nyamira ACK Church. Bosire dismissed Deputy President William Ruto’s several visits to Nyamira and Kisii counties as efforts in futility. “The trips will not sway Kisii people who remain firmly behind Raila Odinga.” Since the 2017 elections, Ruto has made more than 20 trips to Gusii region to woo the community to back his presidential bid. Raila’s critics want him to quit politics after his appointment as African Union High Representative for Infrastructure Development. The Building Bridges Initiative is but part of Raila’s strategy to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta. “Raila has gone back to the drawing board for strategies,” Likoni MP Mishi Mboko said late last year.
