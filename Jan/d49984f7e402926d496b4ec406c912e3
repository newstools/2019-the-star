Farmers in Nyandarua have welcomed the presidential directive that the National Cereals and Produce Board buys maize for Sh2,500 per bag. In Turasha, Kipipiri, brokers are buying the produce for Sh1,200 to Sh1,400. They later supply to millers in Thika. The farmers say over the years, they only read from the media that the government is buying maize, but they have never benefitted. James Komu said he has 300 bags of maize. He hopes to get Sh750,000. He said they see trucks bringing maize from Uasin Gishu to the NCPB stores at Kipipiri. The Star has established there are 19,000 bags of maize at the Kipipiri stores. The maize was bought from Rift Valley the previous season. “Sometimes I wonder if we are really in Kenya. Ours is only to elect leaders who don’t care about us,” Komu said. Muthoni Chege said maize is the only crop that does well in Turasha, but they get little or nothing from it. Farmers lease land for Sh8,000 an acre and buy fertiliser at Sh3,500 per bag. When this is added to other production costs, including labour, the farmers make nothing. Chege said she is still hoarding the maize she harvested the last season, hoping prices will improve. David Karanja said he has 40 bags of maize. He said harvesting cost him Sh8,000 and he spent Sh28,000 to buy eight bags of fertiliser. “If I add other production costs, then you realise I’m doing zero work. I wish the government would assist us,” he said Agriculture executive James Karitu said Nyandarua should be recognised as a maize-producing county. Most farmers in the area grow maize on 0.5 to two acres. Last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta directed Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri to authorise the NCPB to purchase two million bags of maize. The maize will be bought through the Strategic Food Reserve in coordination with the counties. “It is clear that there is sufficient maize in the market being sold at between Sh1,700 and Sh1,800 per bag. I do not expect any changes in the cost of unga,” Uhuru said.
