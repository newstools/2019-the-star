Nairobi’s parking fees revenue has dropped by more than Sh500,000 a day since the rates were reduced mid this month. Motorists have been paying Sh200 from Sh300 for parking in the Central Business District since Monday last week when the new rate was effected. Parking is one of the main sources of revenue for the Nairobi county government. Data seen by the Star shows that 4,674 cars were parked in the CBD on January 7, raising Sh1,535,600. A week later, the county collected Sh1,265,500 from 5,034 cars. Comparative figures for Tuesday, January 8 and January 15 were Sh1,517,300 and Sh1,287,700 from 4,608 and 5,111 cars respectively. Other figures are Wednesday, Jan 9, Sh1,510,600 from 4,509 cars, Jan 16, Sh1,209,400 from 5,513 cars. On Thursday, Jan 10, 4,485 cars raised Sh1,506,800 compared to Jan 17 when Sh1,257,300 was collected from 5, 323 cars. Friday, Jan 11 had 4,375 cars which raised Sh1,449,500 compared to Jan 18 when Sh1,218, 400 was collected from 5,204 cars. Parking director Tom Tinega on Tuesday defended the reduced fee in an interview with the Star. “A county government’s main function is to be a service provider, but not to make money out of people. We have been losing at least Sh500,000 daily but the reduction of parking fees was within the governor’s manifesto,” he explained. An average of 4,000 private cars come to the CBD daily but since last week, City Hall noted an increase of 1,000 vehicles. Governor Mike Sonko in his manifesto had pledged to reduce the parking fee to Sh140. “We all have to start from somewhere. MCAs are the ones who proposed the fee and passed it in the Finance Bill.” The Sh200 fee will serve as a pilot to test the waters,” he said. “Previously, motorists parked in Upperhill and Pangani because they could not afford the Sh300 parking fee within the CBD, but now we have reduced and we can witness a lot of traffic jams especially during rush hour.” Tinega said. The director denied claims that parking attendants have been collecting cash from motorists. “There is no instance when our parking attendants accept cash. It is not allowed as the county does not operate on cash transactions,” he said. He said the county plans to reduce the number of parking attendants whose duty is to guide motorists on how to make parking payments online. The enforcement team inspects vehicles and checks with parking attendants whether the fee is paid.
