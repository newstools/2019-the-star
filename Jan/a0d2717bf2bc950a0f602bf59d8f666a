The Football Kenya Federation FKF, has ruled that Kevin Okoth Wayodi belongs to Tusker FC and not Western Stima FC. The Federation on Saturday said its Player Status Committee has reviewed all documents submitted by the two clubs and the player himself and established that Okoth is Tusker FC’s player. The federation further said that according to the documents tabled, Okoth has a three year’s contract with Tusker FC running from January, 2018 to 30th December 2020. Okoth was however loaned to Western Stima FC for the period of one year ending December 2018. “In view of the same, the player ought not to have played for western Stima FC in their match against Tusker FC as per the loan agreement,” the federation said in a letter dated January, 18. It further said, “A detailed decision containing the reasons for the decision shall be issued within 21 days after this determination”. The federation said the matter was forwarded to the Player Status Committee by Kenya Premier League which sought clarification of the status of Okoth. Tusker FC is said to have objected the move for the club to allow Okoth to play against them yet his loan agreement had expired.
