Harlequins will rest key players for tomorrow’s first round Enterprise Cup match against Ngong Warriors at the RFUEA ground. Assistant coach Benjamin Ayimba said the big guns have played throughout and deserve a well-earned break before next weekend’s showdown against league leaders Kabras Sugar at the same venue. “For us, the Kenya Cup is paramount this season and you’ll probably see a lot of changes because some of our boys have been playing throughout and they need some rest,” Ayimba said. Those likely to be rested for the match against the Nationwide side include skipper Peter Misango, flankers Patrice Agunda, Herman Humwa, fly-half Eden Agero, fullback Lyle Asiligwa, hooker Frank Kalwale, centre David Ambunya and veteran lock Tony Mutai. “We have very big squad of players to choose from and I expect those selected for the match to deliver and enable us progress to the next round,” added Ayimba.
