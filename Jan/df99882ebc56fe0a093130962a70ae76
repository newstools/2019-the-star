Nairobi motorists will from Monday start paying Sh200 parking fees instead of Sh300. In a letter to the E -Government chief officer on Friday, City Hall’s director for parking Tom Tinega said the new fees will be configured into the system. “The daily on-street parking fee for saloon vehicles has been set at Sh200 for all areas other than markets and those bordering other counties,” it reads. Tinega told the Star he received the copy of the document from the Kenya Government Printer. “I received the letter on Thursday and I immediately wrote to the relevant stakeholders. I have given them allowance to make the changes so that from Monday city motorists within the CBD can enjoy the new parking fees,” he said.
