A man accused of stealing clothes stunned an Embu court when he showed up half-naked. Police allegedly undressed Alex Mugo, 32, so that his clothes can be used as exhibits. He neither had a shirt nor trousers. Only a leso was tied around his waist. Immediately he entered the dock yesterday, magistrate Jean Ndeng’eri questioned why he was half-naked. Mugo told the court that he was arrested on Sunday at 1pm and taken to Embu police station for allegedly stealing three pairs of trousers, two vests and two shirts –all valued at Sh4,000 – from Vincent Musembi. The officers stripped him, according to the accused. He said he spent the night naked and that a cellmate gave him a leso. The prosecution applied for the deferment of the case for the accused to take plea while dressed appropriately. He will be returned to court today. Mugo is also accused of being in possession of bhang with a street value of Sh550.
