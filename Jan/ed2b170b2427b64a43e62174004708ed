ODM has told Jubilee leaders to stay away from the April 5 Embakasi South by-election. They have declared the by-election a contest between pro and anti-handshake forces. Embakasi South is going back to the ballot after the Supreme Court nullified the election of MP Julius Mawathe. Jubilee had withdrawn from the race, but a section of its MPs promised to help Mawathe recapture the seat. Yesterday, ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna said Jubilee should not meddle in Nasa affairs, but should instead allow the people of Embakasi South to choose their leaders. ODM is fronting former MP Irshad Sumra to fly its flag in the contest. Sifuna also dismissed calls by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka that ODM should withdraw its candidate and rally behind Mawathe, who was the only Wiper MP in Nairobi. “If there is anyone who thought we were going to withdraw our candidates or give way, then they can clearly see that we are going nowhere,” he said. ODM executive director Oduor Ong’wen said the party will bag the seat. Makadara MP George Aladwa said: “Let us meet at the campaign trail if they cannot stay away. We will mobilise all resources to ensure Sumra wins.” Read: Jubilee withdraws from Ugenya, Embakasi South by-elections More: Keep off Embakasi South poll, ODM tells Nasa affiliates Click here for
