Two carjackers who had stolen a lorry belonging to a Naivasha businessman were arrested on Tuesday. The driver, while heading back to Naivasha was stopped by the carjackers, who had posed as policemen. He was then bundled into a waiting car, drugged and dumped in the bush. The carjackers had driven to Nyahururu town before police caught up with them. Naivasha police boss Kennedy Njoroge said the car had a tracker and the owner noticed something was amiss because it was off and the driver could not be reached on phone. He reported to the police. “The officers had to open fire to stop the driver and his accomplice from driving past a road block. They will be charged with various offences including robbery with violence,” Njoroge said. Click here for the latest political news
