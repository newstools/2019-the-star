Murang’a town is set to be managed by a municipal authority funded by the Nairobi Metropolitan Services Improvement Project. The authority is expected to drastically improve sanitation services in the town that has been struggling with waste management. Under the new arrangement, garbage collection and sewerage services will be also be streamlined. Murang’a county executive for Lands and Housing Sarah Masaki said the municipal authority will be allocated sufficient funds to upgrade the town and improve services. Masaki said the programme called Smart Cities will transform the town. It will also cover Kenol town in Maragua subcounty, which is rapidly growing due to its strategic location along the Nairobi-Nyeri highway. Numerous industries have been set up in Murang’a, fostering economic growth and increasing population in the town. The town does not have a sewerage system and dirty water can be seen flowing in the open. The municipal authority is expected to put up facilities which will help boost sanitation in the town and protect residents from diseases. “The municipality will be receiving funding from the national government and will be run by a board,” Masaki told the Star yesterday. Through this programme, she added, there will be more efficient management of sanitation services which will make the lives of residents better. The municipal authority will start operations this year and will receive funds for improving the living standards of habitants. Murang’a town manager Jeremiah Mwirigi said delays in garbage collection within the town are caused by a shortage of trucks. “Putting this town under a municipality will have solved all these challenges as more funds will be available,” Mwirigi said. There has been an outcry by residents over uncollected garbage.
