Former Africa Most Valuable Player Evelyne Makuto is keen to make a return to the national women’s volleyball team. Makuto, who has been a regular player in the national team, failed to make the cut to the last year’s squad to the World Championship held in Japan, where they won a single match against Kazakhstan. The left attacker and the Kenya Prisons captain was overlooked as the technical bench gave debut to the fast-raising Sharon Chepchumba with Mercy Moim, Noel Murambi and Leonida Kasaya also making the cut. Makuto observed that she is doing everything at her disposal to once again make a comeback to the national outfit. “I have been doing my own training sessions besides what we go through at the club and national team level, knowing very well what I want to achieve. I have always given my all irrespective of whether it’s at the club or national team assignment. I hope my efforts will not be in vain this time around,” said Makuto. She added: “There are a lot of assignment this year as far as the national team events are concerned and I am ready to muscle my way back to the national team. But all this can be achieved first if I get the call up because I believe I still have a lot to offer. But all in all, I will keep pushing as I trust in God.” Makuto, who had a professional stint with Chamalieres, at the same time said she looks forward to this year’s Kenya Volleyball Federation national league and the Africa Club Championship. “I am glad we won the title last season and we hope to build on this going forward. We are scheduled to start training next week ahead of the Africa Club Championship to be staged in Egypt in March and the league altogether and we hope for the best,” said Makuto.
