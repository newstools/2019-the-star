Residents of Taita Taveta have been asked to give birth to more children to save their sub counties from being scrapped. Four sub counties may be abolished after the electoral body, the IEBC, made recommendations. Wundanyi MP Danson Mwashako said the situation can be salvaged by having married couples adding another child into the family. Mwashako said most women close the chapter of giving birth early. “I am not saying children should be born anyhow, but I think it’s time we allow ourselves to get babies up to the age of 49 years,” he said. Taveta MP Naomi Shaaban said she will support efforts to ferry natives back to the county to be counted during the census.
