Governor Mike Sonko has once again promised to transform Nairobi and make it the best city to live and invest in. In his New Year message to the residents, Sonko pledged to complete ongoing projects and initiate new ones to improve the lives of the residents. He vowed to dismantle cartels that have hampered effective services. “This coming year of 2019, is my second year in office. I want to ensure that all major projects in my manifesto are implemented and completed before my four years in office,” he said. He said City Hall will strive to build stadia in each of the 85 wards. Each ward will also have a fire station to help respond to fires, Sonko promised. Learning will also be free in all Early Childhood Education centres in the city this year. Markets will be expanded and rehabilitated. Some residents say he had delivered on the promises he made last year. He said he will see to it that an 11-storey maternity block is built to ease pressure at the troubled Pumwani Maternity Hospital. He also promised to deliver on his pledge to built a waste recycling plant plant at the Dandora dumpsite. City Hall has been promising to build the plant for several years now.
