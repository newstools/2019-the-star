Busia deputy governor Moses Mulomi (pictured) has declared he will run for governor in 2022. He said on Saturday he is fully prepared to battle other aspirants. He made the announcement through his representative, Ernest Ababu, a prominent Eldoret businessman. Ababu urged residents to back Mulomi’s bid. “Mulomi has what it takes to succeed Sospeter Ojaamong,” Ababu told mourners during the burial of Marianna Adhiambo in Bukhoba, Ruambwa sublocation, Budalangi. Mulomi donated Sh6,000 to the bereaved family. Former Deputy Governor Kizito Wangalwa from Butula subcounty could also enter the fray. He lost the race in 2017. Last week, former Marachi North MCA Gabriel Okello urged Butula residents to identify and support one of their own for the county top job. “Butula has held the position of deputy governor for two consecutive terms,” he said.
