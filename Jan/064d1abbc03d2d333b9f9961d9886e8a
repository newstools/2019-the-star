Nyamira Woman Representative Jerusha Momanyi has urged leaders to protect the county’s good name and not call it a mere subcounty. She said poor development has led to the negative comments about the county and urged each leader to perform their roles so Nyamira can prosper. She spoke at Kebirigo Primary School on Monday, when she presented 80 trainees funded by the National Government Affirmative Action Fund to take courses in Kisumu and Nairobi. The trainees were selected from Nyamira’s 20 wards in Nyamira and will study masonry, plumbing, motor vehicle mechanics and driving, among other fields. “Our county has been undermined because so many people believe nothing good in terms of development can ever come from Nyamira. She condemned people referring to Nyamira as a subcounty, saying it will develop with time. “On several occasions we have heard some people saying it should be merged. In case they are waiting for the merger, then we are very sorry, because just like a child, Nyamira needs time to grow and to be like other counties,” she said. “Nyamira county belongs to all of us. All leaders need to come up with ideas on how we can develop it,” she said. Last year, Nyamira county government said it would spend Sh10 million to renovate county markets to improve the condition of poor markets that threaten traders’ health. The traders had protested against the “filthy”conditions for more than a year
