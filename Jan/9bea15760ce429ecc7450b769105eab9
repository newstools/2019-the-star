The Kiambu county chief officer in charge of Agriculture and marketing John Ngigi has been directed by Governor Ferdinand Waititu to proceed on his annual leave immediately. Waititu said his directive was informed by Ngigi’s prolonged stay at work due to the nature of his office that seemingly made it impossible for him to take leave. “It has been noted that you have not taken your annual leave for some time due to the busy nature of your office. You are, therefore, hereby, advised to proceed for your annual 30 days leave with effect from Thursday, January 3,” Waititu said. The governor directed Ngigi, a brother of Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria, to hand over to the chief officer in charge of Livestock, Fisheries and Veterinary Services. He is expected to resume duty on February 14. Studies around the world have shown that some employees avoid taking their paid leave days due to fear. A research by Glassdoor done in 2017 indicated that some 54 per cent of US employees refused to take their paid vacations because they believed they could be replaced in absentia. It showed that 34 per cent fear getting behind on their work, 30 per cent believed no one else at their company could handle the work in their absence, 22 per cent indicated complete dedication to their work, while 21 per cent felt they can never be disconnected from their work.
