Yesterday’s meeting between Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia and public transport operators was one of those rare occasions when the stakeholders’ focus was the public interest. The PSV operators welcomed the adoption of the Bus Rapid Transport system. Nairobi’s Central Business District is chaotic all the time after 5pm. Frustration is written on every commuter’s face due not only to inadequate transport but also to the undisciplined matatu and bus operators. They are dirty, rude and deceitful. The introduction of the BRT will certainly minimise this frustration. Indeed, it is a system that is long overdue, given that our neighbours — Tanzania and Rwanda — and far off South Africa and Egypt are way ahead of us, having introduced the system many years ago. Another welcome decision from yesterday’s meeting is the introduction of two car-free days twice a week in certain parts of the CBD. Streets in these parts of the city will hopefully be used by small-scale retailers to sell their wares without the fear of being harassed by the city Inspectorate personnel and also being run over by motorists.
