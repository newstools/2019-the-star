A Kitale businessman has been accused of grabbing a public land and blocking a road that serves hundreds. Businessman Vipul Dodhia yesterday dug trenches on Robinson road in Hospital ward to stop the road works. Residents using the route were forced to look for an alternative way get to their businesses. The ward rep Eric Wafula said the road has been there since the colonial times and sits on a public land. “I received a call this morning from residents asking why we have blocked the road, only to find out that Vipul was behind it,” he said. Wafula said that he wrote a letter to the businessman informing him that the road is set for construction. Angry residents pulled down a perimeter wall on the private land that boarders the encroached road. But in a rejoinder, Vipul said that he will move to court to sue the MCA for intruding onto his land. He said that the 10 meters wide road passes through his land and that it should be moved to the correct position to conform with the map. He told the Star that in October, 2014 a county surveyor found out that the 10 meters wide road needs to be moved. “I am a disappoint man, and am moving to court to sue the county for intruding into my piece of land , how can one claimed that I have encroached on the road yet the county survey office are the ones who recommended the road to be moved to the other side,” he said. In a separate function Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba said that land grabbing in Trans Nzoia is one of the reason why the county is experiencing slow development.
