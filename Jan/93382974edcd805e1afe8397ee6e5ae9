Attorney General Paul Kihara has said a poor job done by investigators makes it difficult for the prosecution and the Judiciary to deliver results. "That cannot be the case and we have to do something about it. It cannot be right that the agencies responsible for investigations are prevented from doing what the Constitution and the rule of law requires," he said. Speaking during the swearing-in of the new anti-graft boss on Monday, Kihara urged new CEO Twalib Mbarak to make sure his cases are beyond reproach. "This is not going to be a walk in the park, Kenyans in particular will hold you to the oath of office you have taken and the remarks that you have made. What we expect is for you to work faithfully as you have sworn to do without fear, favour, discrimination and to work with the all agencies involved in law enforcement," he said. "We will not expect you to have little wars and sibling rivalry between yourself and the DPP or DCI. We will be watching on behalf of Kenyans."

He questioned why cases in courts take too long to be executed or be completed. "I can say here honourable Chief Justice the expectations of Kenyans has not been fulfilled, we have spent far too much time talking, but we haven't got tangible results which Kenyans expect, demand and are entitled to and the Constitution and rule of law," he said. "You must not distinguish or discriminate. Nobody is above the law." However, Chief Justice David Maraga said investigative agencies should bring watertight cases to the courts if they to see convictions. Kihara also lauded Halakhe Waqo for his work during his six year tenure at the Integrity centre.
