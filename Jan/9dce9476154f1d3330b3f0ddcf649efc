Police on Sunday arrested 17 youths at a hideout in Samburu town. Authorities say they suspected the youth to be al Shabaab recruits who were being prepared to be transported to Somalia. Kinango OCPD John Kemboi said the 17 were hiding in the holding centre, a two-room house near Samburu market. They are 2 ladies and 15 men aged between 18-27 years. "Our informers tipped us and we raided the house," Kemboi told the Star. Kemboi said after interrogations, the youths confessed to having been promised jobs with huge salaries.
