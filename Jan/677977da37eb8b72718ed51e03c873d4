Counties are looking for ways to improve their credit ratings to attract investors. Representatives from counties, the Treasury, the Commission on Revenue Allocation and the World Bank met on Monday to discuss how counties can improve their credit worthiness. Better credit enables them to raise funds from capital markets. The meeting in Nairobi will run through February 1. “Only with a good credit profile will counties be able to borrow from the capital markets or even benefit from the World Bank programmes, such as the Kenya Devolution Support Programme and the Kenya Urban Support Programme,” Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati said. He said counties want to cut down on pending bills. Late last year, counties completed and submitted self-assessment forms for credit worthiness. The initiative is also designed to help counties re-evaluate themselves in key areas that boost or hurt credit worthiness. Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi said the borrowing model should be designed to extend beyond the five-year tenure of governors. CRA chairperson Jane Kiringai said counties face challenges while seeking external sources of finance.She said the capital markets shy away from investing in counties due to “bad books”. Nine counties, among them Bungoma, have been selected for a pilot funding project. Others are Meru, Lamu, Laikipia, Mombasa, Makueni, Nandi, Samburu and Kisumu.
