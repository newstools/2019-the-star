Good Morning. The court of appeal will on May 10 rule on whether it will overturn a decision of the lower court that ordered a civil servant to forfeit unexplained assets worth Sh41 million to the government. Appellate Judges Philip Waki, Otieno Odek and Gatembu Kairu set the date after parties in the case highlighted their submissions on Tuesday. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Wednesday morning. Sombre mood as Cellulant 6 eulogised as brave "My brother did not like girls with big hips." These were the words of Janet Wangari, sister of Kelvin Kariuki Gitonga who was killed in the Dusit attack in Nairobi on Tuesday last week. Wangari was eulogising her brother, 28, who died together with five other colleagues who worked for Cellulant Corporation. He was easygoing and independent-minded. Mourners laughed through their tears. _____________________________________________________ Uhuru trims Ruto's powers, makes Matiang'i super Minister President Uhuru Kenyatta has radically reorganised his government and established a four-tier executive authority which brings Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi at the heart of his administration. The elevation of Matiangi with supervisory roles across government is likely to whittle down Deputy President William Ruto’s influence in government as the president’s de facto second in command. Matiangi would take charge of the implementation and monitoring of all development projects initiated and funded by the national government through a new cabinet sub-committee. _____________________________________________________ Social justice centres now leading the war on police killings Social justice centres have emerged as the new face of the push against extrajudicial killings in the country as they work in the grass roots, ensuring the evidence they supply to IPOA against accused officers are watertight. Extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances are still ripe in the country despite the much touted reforms in the criminal justice system by the Jubilee administration. _____________________________________________________ Quality question haunts the push to play Kenyan music Should media houses play Kenyan music more often? The issue has bubbled under the surface for ages, but exploded earlier this month on social media. Artistes are indignant at radio presenters, TV hosts and deejays who won't play their music on heavy rotation, while seemingly favouring Bongo and Naija tunes. The counter-argument stipulates that there’s a need for delivery of "quality music". _____________________________________________________ Why new curriculum couldn't wait longer - CS Amina Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed has defended her about-turn move on the implementation of the new school curriculum. She said the 2-6-3-3-3 curriculum, which will replace the 32-year-old, 8-4-4 system, couldn't wait longer. The system was piloted in 470 schools - 10 per county, and was to continue until 2020, something that the CS clarified amid opposition to the plan. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
