The election is nearly four years away so everyone should just tone down the political heat, Senate speaker Kenneth Lusaka has urged. He spoke in Nangwe on Saturday during a thanksgiving mass for Nairobi chief officer Peter Mukenya. “We are not going to have elections tomorrow. Why are people going for each other’s neck as if Parliament has been dissolved?” Lusaka said. He said the early 2022 campaigns are not good for the country and will only derail development. Lusaka urged politicians to focus on the Big Four agenda, which will be more beneficial to Wanjiku than the political rhetoric. He said too much time was wasted after the last election and he had expected that after the handshake leaders would get down to work to make up. Lusaka said both Houses of Parliament have a lot in their trays, which they should address, instead of the sideshows. “...for example, the Senate has a big role to ensure they strengthen devolution.”
