The Water Resources Authority said water is dropping in Lake Naivasha. WRA Naivasha manager Geoffrey Mworia said water levels in River Malewa, which is the lake’s main tributary, had dropped sharply. Rivers Karate and Gilgil, which flow into the lake, have completely dried up. The authority has termed the drop normal during this period when the catchment area is experiencing long periods of sunlight. “Though the water levels in the lake and the rivers have dropped, the water bodies are healthy compared to other years,” Mworia said.
