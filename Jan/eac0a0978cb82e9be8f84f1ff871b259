After being confirmed as the new Posta Rangers coach, John Kamau has set his sights on steering the club to a top ten finish in the ongoing Kenya Premier League. Kamau was roped into Rangers technical bench during the pre-season to serve as the technical director and was elevated to the rank of head coach after Sammy “Pamzo” Omolo’s contract with the mailmen expired on the final day of 2018. The youthful coach, who returns to the club after relinquishing his services with them four years ago, is banking to experienced players who were spared the axe during the preseason, to restore their glory. The club retained a number of senior players among veteran defender Jockins Atudo long serving midfielder Hillary Echesa, Gershon Likono and Danson Kago. “I have both short and long term goals here but I want to steer the team to finish in the top ten this year. Top ten will be fair considering last season, the team was battling relegation. This will be good start for my tenure before muscling for the title in subsequent seasons. I am glad I have experienced players here who will help meet the target. I have worked with a few of them and I believe imparting my philosophy will be smooth and players will adapt quickly and get positive results.” Kamau, who will be assisted by former Kenyan international centre half Pascal Ochieng, lauded his predecessor for assembling quality players and ruled out beefing the squad, noting the depth was enough to navigate through the season. The club also reunited with their former player Edward Kauka who will serve as a physical trainer while Joseph Ruto and John Wakhu are the goalkeeper trainer and team manager respectively. Kamau’s first assignment is against AFC Leopards today at Afraha Stadium.
