A blogger arrested in connection to the circulation of a ‘fake’ sex tape of Wajir Woman Representative Fatuma Gedi has been released. The Director of Public Prosecutions through state counsel Donex Ongila told Kiambu resident magistrate Rita Orora that Douglas Mbaya was no longer a “person of interest.” “We do not intend to open charges against the suspect and we pray for the court to release him,” Ongila said. The prosecutor said police were still pursuing other suspects in connection to the matter. Mbaya’s lawyer did not object the release of his client. He asked for orders for police to release his client’s phone that was confiscated. On December 28, cybercrime investigating officer Bakhith Khaungu asked the court to allow police detain Mbaya for 14 days to allow him collect evidence against the suspect.

He said police were intending to travel to Wajir and Kakamega counties to arrest more suspects. Police said Mbaya was involved in the circulation of a video of Gedi in a compromising situation with an unidentified man. Mbaya did not take plea. The suspect was expected to be charged on January 14 with publishing obscene information in electronic form contrary to Section 84D of the Kenya Information and Communication Act. Gedi dismissed the tape as fake. The first-time MP was caught up in controversy in August after she was accused of bribing MPs to shoot down a report on the import of contraband sugar.
