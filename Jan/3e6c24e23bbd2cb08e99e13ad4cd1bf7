Staying positive and living around people with positive energy has helped Anita Nderu fight depression, a problem she suffered for five months last year. "The biggest lesson is to be with good people. That I learnt from that season I had," Anita Nderu told Word Is on Friday. The jovial radio and TV presenter said she had started hating her friends, and that is how she realised she was not okay. "I was tired all the time and did not want to see anyone around me or even talk to anyone because I was moody all the time. I told my relatives that I was not okay,"  she said. "I don't really know what the problem was but it happened time to time without me noticing something was wrong."
