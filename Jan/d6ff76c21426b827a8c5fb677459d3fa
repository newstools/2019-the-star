Deputy President William Ruto has rallied behind President Uhuru Kenyatta's new administration and a four-tier executive authority. This is the first time, the DP has publicly spoken on the issue since Uhuru elevated Interior CS Fred Matiang'i on Tuesday with supervisory roles across government. Ruto in tweet on Thursday urged all government officers to adhere to the President's directive on setting up committees at county, regional and national levels. "GoK officers at all levels should align their operations to the ORDER issued by HE the President setting up committees at county, regional, national (technical) and national (cabinet) for purposes of effective implementation of projects and programmes and efficient communication," he said. Some of Ruto's supporters had cried foul, asking Uhuru to come clean on the real mandate of the DP. Matiang'i is expected to monitor and implement all development projects initiated and funded by the national government. Ruto has previously been the one officiating development projects across the country earning himself the "tanga tanga" tag. The new directive also means MPs will no longer be trooping to his office to lobby for development projects. He will chair a sub-committee known as the National Development Implementation and Communication Cabinet Committee. It will comprise of all CSs, Attorney General Kihara Kariuki and Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua. Read: Uhuru trims Ruto’s power in new order Click here for the latest political news
