Governor Wycliffe Oparanya on Wednesday told off Kwale's Salim Mvurya over the latter's criticism of the election of the new council of governors. The Kakamega county boss, who was elected chairman during the January 14 election, said the poll was conducted within the provisions set by the County Government Act, 2012. Mvurya on Tuesday criticised the Council of Governors saying it ignored a deal made in 2017. The deal was for him to succeed Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok whose term as council chair ended in December last year. The county chief, who skipped the election, said the move was because he was unhappy with how the seat was vacated. "This put to question the integrity of the council," he told journalist at his office. The agreement was that Mvurya would take over form the Nanok after six months and be deputised by Kirinyaga's Anne Waiguru. However, Oparanya dismissed the county boss saying the seats were declared vacant after which those interested in them applied. "I never saw his application form. There is no election where you can be promised a seat. If anything, he was promised to take over from Nanok after six months and it is more than a year since then." He also watered down assertions that none of three female governors got a top seat at the council. Bomet's Joyce Laboso was voted chairperson of the Education committee at the council. "People are elected on the basis of their capacity to handle tasks that come with the role. The female governors were elected not because they are women, but because they were fit to serve as governors." Deputy CoG chair Mwangi Wa Iria, who accompanied the governor to the presser, said due process was followed during the conduct of the election. "The engagement was through a clear process as spelt out in the county government act," the Murang'a governor said. The governor's council holds elections every year.
