Two people were killed on Monday evening when a truck transporting sulphuric acid crashed and burst into flames on the Eldoret-Webuye road at the Kaburengo interchange. The driver and his turnboy were burnt beyond recognition, despite attempts by the emergency services including St John Ambulance responders and firefighters to put out the flames. The incident adds to 16 the total number of people who have died at the blackspot since last month. On December 21 last year, 12 people died on the same spot after a fuel tanker crashed into a matatu and burst into flames. Over the weekend, two other people were burnt beyond recognition in an explosion which involved four vehicles, including a fuel tanker. Click here for the latest political news
