Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has denied that he insulted President Uhuru Kenyatta on New Year's eve at Thika stadium. Kuria said his sentiments were directed at Governor Ferdinand Waititu and Kiambu Women Rep Gathoni wa Muchomba whom he accused of orchestrating slow development in the county. He accused the two of competing over the rehabilitation of alcoholics which he termed as shameful and petty. “When leadership in Nyeri are inviting the President to commission markets, an airstrip and a road, the leadership of Kiambu are directing the president to issue certificates to drunkards, its a shame," he said. He said his attacks on the duo were misconstrued by people who want to bring enmity between him and the president. Kuria said his long-standing working relationship with the president speaks for itself. "We have worked together every step of the way almost on a daily basis from 2007 up to the present day and I have never disrespected the President," Kuria told reporters at Kimunyu shopping Centre on Friday. Kimuyu is just a few meters from where members of the Kiama Kia Ma elders held a meeting to demand him to apologise to the president.

"If indeed I abused anyone, the abuses were directed at the two," Kuria said. Wamuchomba accused Kuria of disrespecting the president and asked him to seek rehabilitation. Her remarks came after Kuria on December 31 expressed displeasure at the development projects initiated in Central region by the Jubilee government. A visibly drunk Kuria said the government had marginalised the region in favour of other "regions that did not even vote for Uhuru".
