Residents of Rukindu sub-location in Tharaka Nithi county want the KWS to intervene in the frequent monkey invasions and destruction of crops. They said the primates have been destroying their crops and lately, they are even raiding their kitchens to eat up food stored there. "We depend on agriculture and the apes mainly feed on maize, beans and avocados. They have multiplied in numbers and are now in the habit of entering into our kitchens and eating our food,” said Erastus Ngai, a secretary to a local farmers group. Ngai said if the Kenya Wildlife Service cannot deal with the animals then the residents will be forced to act on their own. “They have exposed us to hunger through eating our crops and our ready food. I have planted several times but reaped nothing,” said one of the committee members Dorothy Kinyua. According to the residents, the monkeys have wreaked havoc in their sub-location since the residents have to stay longer in their gardens in order to guard their farms. They complained that children too have been sent back home due to lack of school fees since the monkeys have fed on the crops that were the main source of income. The area assistant chief Fredrick Gitonga said the residents have reported to him on various occasions and has always forwarded their grievances to the KWS and is awaiting their response.
