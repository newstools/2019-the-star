Women using tampons will have to wait one more month for to find them on supermarket shelves. There has been a shortage in several outlets in Nairobi, forcing women to order the products from online vendors. This has pushed the price from about Sh200 to as high as Sh1,500 to cater for shipping charges. Some have resorted to using menstrual cups. According to Kim Fay East Africa, the main distributor of Kotex tampons in the Kenya, the shortage is as a result of hitches in supply of raw materials used to produce the tampons. "It has been a challenge getting the raw materials but we hope to sort out the issue in a month's time," an official at the company said on Friday. The distributor however said the shortage has no relation with the recall of some Kotex tampons in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Radborne Clark Kenya, importers of OB tampons, attributed the shortage of the product to import hitches. An official who preferred to remain anonymous said there is slow movement of cargo due to more stringent inspection procedures. "This is hurting business because clearing of cargo nowadays takes six to eight weeks," the source said. The Kenya Revenue Authority and Kebs in May last year issued new procedures requiring that all cargo be inspected and issued with a certificate of inspection. Feminine hygiene products such as tampons are some of the goods affected by the new procedures. This is in a bid to check against inflow of fake products into the Kenyan market.
