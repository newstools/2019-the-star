The government plans to arm guards to improve security, the director general of Private Security Regulatory Authority Fazul Mahamad has said. The government will vet all security guards before arming them, he said. Security companies will also be vetted to weed out criminals in the industry before licensing private guards to own guns. “We will vet each one so that we can weed out criminals and work with people who respect the law and are ready work with the government to improve security in the country,” Fazul said. He addressed journalists in Nairobi on Friday. The director general said the government would push for better terms of employment for all private guards. “We must have responsibility, overtime and other allowances paid. We are also looking at good salaries,” he said. Fazul said the move to arm private guards is meant to enhance security in the country. In May last year, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i announced plans to arm security guards to tackle crime. The CS also announced intentions to withdraw armed police from the cash in transit business and leave the private firms to escort money and other valuables for institutions and individuals.

If we trust you to take care of such huge key strategic installations in this country, then we should be able to also trust you with firearms,” he said. Fazul said the process to arm guards will start after the government develops regulations on how guards will use guns. “The government will issue gun licenses to companies after they have been vetted. The companies will then, in turn, arm their personnel to conduct their business,” he said. He said Tuesday’s terror attack at the DusitD2 Hotel could have easily been prevented had the security guards been armed. Click here for the latest political news
