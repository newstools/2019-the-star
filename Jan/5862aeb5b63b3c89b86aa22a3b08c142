Chief Justice David Maraga has told magistrates to ensure they win back public trust following accusations that Judiciary was a hindrance to war on graft. The Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji, the DCI, the Attorney General and a section of leaders had accused the Judiciary of being a hindrance in the war on corruption by easily giving bonds. Speaking during the swearing in ceremony of new 47 magistrates at the Supreme Court yesterday, Maraga urged the magistrates to do what they can to address the issue to win back the public trust. “We do not condone corruption. I get recommendations from the public about good and bad magistrates. I get unanimous complaints against judges too and I keep records. You must have seen media report on the corruption conference held at Bomas of Kenya last week. We’re heavily and roundly criticised.” Maraga commented about the blames saying that if things are not done properly no one will trust the Judiciary. "I urge you to take charge of your courtrooms. Ensure that you effectively manage cases and matters that come to you. Endless adjournments of cases on frivolous grounds are the very reasons that we have cases that stay in our courts for years. The public are fed up with us on this. We cannot afford to have this," he said. Click here for
