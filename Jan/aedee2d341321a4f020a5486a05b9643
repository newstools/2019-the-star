West Pokot leaders have raised concern over the mass failure of students in last year’s Kenya Certificate for Secondary Education. The leaders are now demanding a report from the Ministry of Education over exam failure in the county. Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto, Pokot South MP David Pkosing and Sigor MP Peter Lochakapong want a meeting to discuss the problem. In the county, no student got grade A. Speaking at Chemororoch Secondary School after donating a school bus bought by Kapenguria CDF, the leaders said the county dropped from a mean grade of 7 to 3. “That was a terrible failure. Most of students failed. It isas sad story,” said Pkosing. The leaders said delocalisation partly contributed to mass failure. “The teachers who came don’t understand anything in the county. Some came slowly late thus this affected everything,” said Pkosing. He appealed to Education CS Aminah Mohammed to share with them what was the problem. “The the drop is not normal . The graph is abnormal and the ministry should tell us why,” he said. They said the results have locked out many students from proceeding to institutions of higher education. The leaders said the committees on education in Parliament and the Senate should quickly investigate if there was any problem with the results.
