There is anxiety at the National Police Service with ongoing lobbying to replace the Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet whose term ends this month. Key sources within the corridors of power told the Star that brokers are keen to influence President Uhuru Kenyatta’s next choice of the IG in their favour. Among names fronted include Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti, Deputy Inspector General Edward Mbugua and the head of Administration Police Noor Gabbow. Others are the National Intelligence Service Director General Philip Kameru and former National Counter Terrorism Centre Director Isaac Ochieng. “Apart from the normal duties you realise that the next police boss will be influential in the succession politics after Uhuru’s term comes to an end in 2022,” a senior official at the Office of the President told the Star.

The appointment follows the resignation of David Kimaiyo the same month.  Uhuru appointed Kimaiyo as the chairman of the Kenya Airports Authority. “The Inspector-General shall be appointed for a single four-year term, and is not eligible for re-appointment,” the Constitution dictates. Uhuru has entrusted intelligence and military officials in key strategic positions within the government. They include EACC chief Twalib Mbarak, DPP Noordin Haji and the Head of Immigration Alexander Muteshi among others. “It is a tricky affair since officers currently serving are looking for an opportunity to grow and it is tricky to always bring in an outsider,” a state house aide said. Boinnet’s replacement will complete the slew of changes that are designed to reform the security and criminal justice system in the country.
