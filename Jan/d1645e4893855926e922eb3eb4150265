A 12-year-old girl is nursing injuries at a hospital in Karachuonyo after a hippo attacked and broke her leg on Sunday morning. Belinda Akinyi was attacked at Chowe beach in Wang’chieng location when she went to fetch water in Lake Victoria. Beach chairman Peter Shikuku said the hippo broke the right leg of the minor. “The hippo grabbed and broke her leg before residents came to her rescue,” Shikuku said. The animal disappeared in water hyacinth after the incident. Shikuku said there are frequent hippo attacks in the lake and asked Kenya Wildlife Services to intervene. “Human-wildlife conflict is rampant around the beach. We appeal for relevant authorities to help us get a solution amicably,” he added. Senior Chief Peter Agunga said they have reported the matter to police. “We hope the pupil will get well and continue with her studies. Let residents refrain from going to areas frequently invaded by hippos,” Agunga said. Click here for the latest political news
