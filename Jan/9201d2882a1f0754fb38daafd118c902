Four men masquerading as traffic police officers have been arrested in Homa Bay after hijacking a lorry. The impostors were arrested along the Oyugisâ€“Kosele road on Tuesday evening. They had allegedly hijacked a lorry belonging to Shivling Supermarket in Kisii town. The lorry was transporting 200 bags of sugar from Sukari Industries in Ndhiwa subcounty to the supermarket in Kisii town. The impostors blocked the lorry and ordered driver Brian Owade to stop near Nyachenge trading centre in Kisii, saying they wanted to inspect the vehicle. Homa Bay police commander Marius Tum yesterday said the impostors ordered the driver out of the vehicle and beat him up. They put him in the lorry and drove off with him. Tum said the impostors dumped him in thicket near Lwala Dispensary on the Kisii-Oyugis road. Tum said they could not immediately disclose the names of the suspects as investigations are going on.
