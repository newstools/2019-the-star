A month-long campaign encouraging women to grow out their body hair has got off to a flying start, with women from around the world showing their support with social media selfies. Januhairy, started by Laura Jackson, 21, from Warwickshire was launched at the beginning of the month to help women love and accept their natural hair while raising money for charity - similar to a female version of Movember. Just a few days in, women from Brazil to Romania have joined the challenge, sharing the results online under the hashtag #Januhairy, which now has more than 2,300 posts on Instagram. While some are flaunting the natural fuzz on their armpits, others have taken photos of their unshaven legs, saying there's no shame in rocking a natural look. Another said: I believe in my choice of shaving when I want to, not because you think I’m disgusting. 'I know a woman can be #sexy with #hairylegs or without. Also men are sexy with #hair or #nohair #romanianvlogger #hairylegs #freedom #freeyourself. Another Instagram user shared a longer view with the caption: I’m so down for #Januhairy - let’s make 2019 the year that women are no longer shamed for their natural body hair. 'Let me be clear, if my pit kitty offends you, that problem is not mine, it’s yours and you should go away and do some unpacking on that. 'Think it’s gross on me but fine on men then you need to go check your sexism stat. According to a 2017 study women who shave spend £6,500 and eight weeks of their life managing unwanted hair. The expenditure figure more than trebles if you wax. Think of all the better things we could be doing/spending our money on? That’s a load of holidays you could have gone on, dinners and drinks with friends, spa days etc. Is it really worth it?!' Click here for the latest political news
