Four suspects in the DusitD2 Hotel attack were yesterday detained 30 days to allow police complete investigations into their case. Muktar Ibrahim Ali, Issack Hussein, and Sakina Mariam Abdalla are facing charges of aiding and abetting last Tuesday's assault which left 21 people dead. A magistrate court ruled: "Whereas it has been proved to me on oath that for purposes of investigation, it is necessary for the respondents to be remanded at a police station within Nairobi for 30 days." Inspector Monica Githaiga, the investigating officer, said in her affidavit that it was established that the suspects were in constant communication with several other phone numbers located in Somalia. She told the court that her team of investigators are in the process of interviewing other persons believed to be connected to the attack. The DCI is examining the said persons financial records, call data records with a view to establishing their link to the incident. Githaiga added that Ibrahim Ali is believed to be recruiting young men to participate in terrorism acts and radicalisation. The detective added that she also needs time to verify claims by Amina Abdalla that she report her son's disappearance to officers at the Isiolo police station. She further told the court that the intelligence reports show that the attackers had other associates who assisted them in planning and executing the attack. "There is, therefore, a need to carry out detailed interviews with the respondents and the associates of the attackers once arrested."
