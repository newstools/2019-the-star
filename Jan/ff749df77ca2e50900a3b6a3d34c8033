Kenya Hockey Union men’s Premier League returnees Sailors Hockey Club have signed Lusaka Sharks midfielder Samson Tembo ahead of the March 3 kick off. Tembo was part of the Zambia team that participated in the 2014 Summer Youth Olympic Games in China. The Sailors, who were relegated to the super league last season as the Union sought to split the league in three tiers made their return to the top division after emerging overall winners with 48 points at the end of last season. Team founder Collins Asimba confirmed the Zambian is among the four players who will turn up for the team that will be seeking to retain their status in the top tier at the end of the season. Others who will be part of the Sailors are former Parklands High School duo of Jackson Masibo (goalkeeper) and Kevin Opondo (midfielder) and former Thika Rovers’ midfielder James Juma. Tembo will be second Zambian player to feature for the Sailors after the former Chase Bank sponsored side signed attacking midfielder Victor Kumwenda last season. “While other clubs are going for names, we are keen on developing talent. We have signed four players as our goal this season is to retain our status in the Premier league and hopefully, we can now think of challenging for the title next season,” said Asimba. He added: “We had a pretty good season last year, only losing two matches against Mvita and Multi Media University and we hope to carry the same form to the top tier. We are returning to a familiar grounds, where we know our way but we are aware it’s going to be tough. However, we are psyched up and ready to have our presence felt,” Asimba revealed they have changed the name to Sailors having not benefitted from the Chase Bank as far as the financial help is concerned.
