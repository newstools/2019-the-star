World 5,000m champion Helen Obiri will be the star attraction at the Kenya Defence Forces cross country Championships today at Kahawa Barracks Fresh from winning the IAAF cross country event in Elgoibar, Spain recently, Obiri will be seeking to win the title for a fourth time having also won last year at Moi Air Base. Obiri will use the event as build up to the track season and the World Athletic Championships in Qatar later in the year. The reigning Commonwealth Games 5,000 metres champion faces a stellar field for the event in what will be sweltering hot conditions at the course. Sela Jepleting, Agnes Chesang and Perine Nengapi are expected to give Obiri a run for her money in the senior women’s race. In the men’s category, defending champion Hillary Kering is back to defend his title. He will have to contend with the likes of two-time world marathon champion Geoffrey Kirui, John Chepkwony, Stephen Arita and Franklin Ngelel in what is expected to be a hotly contested men’s race. The top 3 athletes in the various race categories will represent the Kenya Defence Forces at the National Cross Country Championships cum world trials slated for Eldoret on February 23. This is the first time the trials are being held outside Nairobi.
