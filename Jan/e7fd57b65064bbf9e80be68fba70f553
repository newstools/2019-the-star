Nakuru governor Lee Kinyanjui has criticised politicians engaged in “premature 2022 campaigns”, saying they were distractingfrom development. Speaking in Nakuru town on Monday, Kinyanjui said the ongoing succession debate within Jubilee party was undermining government unity and its functions. The governor said it was slightly over a year after the last elections yet the clamour for the next presidential candidates was gaining “uncomfortable currency.” “Debates on drumming up support for a particular candidate are a major threat to the Jubilee manifesto and a burden to ordinary citizens,” Kinyanjui said. He was reacting to remarks by former Jubilee vice chairman David Murathe that Deputy President William Ruto was unfit to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta. Murathe’s remarks have stoked fierce responses from Ruto allies. Bahati MP Kimani Ngujiri and his Sirisia counterpart John Waluke have called for early elections. Murathe, who resigned from his Jubilee party post on Sunday, has promised to move to the Supreme Court to block Ruto from running. Kinyanjui said the remarks have put the development of political parties under scrutiny. “While the parties are meant to plan and execute their succession in a civilised and orderly manner, the debate is extended to non-party members and become a national debate in funerals and church meetings,” he said. Murathe spoke at a funeral in Rarieda. Kinyanjui said Jubilee was a mature party with a dispute resolution organ. “Why would a senior party official find it appropriate to drag a whole nation into a party affair? It is irresponsible and reckless to say the least,” Kinyanjui said. He asked politicians to use appropriate channels to resolve disputes and stop whipping up public emotions, saying it could jeopardise peace and stability.
