There was little to separate former champions Ulinzi Stars and Tusker as they played to a goal-less stalemate in a Kenyan Premier League match at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru yesterday. Both sides came into the encounter hoping to get the three points in a bid to close the gap on the early pacesetters Mathare United and Bandari but instead cancelled each other out to return home with a point apiece. Tusker remain fourth on the table on goal difference with 14 points same as Kariobangi Sharks. Western Stima who were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Nzoia United are third with 15 points. On Saturday Chrispin Oduor scored a brace as the Mathare United edged Kakamega Homeboyz 3-2 at Kasarani to return to the top of the log. KCB remain in the bottom three after letting slip an early lead before settling for a 1-1 draw against struggling Vihiga United. In the National Super League 10-man Shabana beat visiting Bidco 2-0 at Gusii Stadium. Shabana took a fifth minute lead through Oscar Oketch who headed home Bob Mugalia’s cross from the left flank past a well beaten Brandon Obiero in the Bidco goal. In the 80th minute, Oketch added Shabana’s second goal, taking advantage of a mix up between Obierio and his defenders. “This is a very important win for us after three consecutive losses. We kept a clean sheet against Bidco which is a good team,” said Shabana’s assistant coach Andrew Kanuli. Shabana had initially lost three games on the trot against Wazito, Ushuru and Eldoret Youth. Wazito ended Kisumu All Stars’ unbeaten record, beating the Bule Eagles 2-1. Tedy Osok and David Orem scored for Wazito while Dennis Ochieng scored Wazito’s consolation goal. Ushuru maintained their top position after walloping Eldoret Youth 2-0 while Thika United and Talanta battled to a 2-2 draw. St Joseph’s Youth defeated Green Commandos 1-0 with Fortune Sacco and Nairobi City Stars battling to a 2-2 draw in another encounter.
