The court will on Tuesday rule on whether five suspects charged with planning and executing the deadly Garissa University College terror attack that claimed 147 lives in 2015 will be put on their defence. Mohamed Ali Abdikar, Hassan Aden Hassan, Sahal Diriye, Osman Abdi and Rashid Charles Mberesero have denied 156 counts related to the attack. These include; killing, conspiracy to commit a terrorist act, committing a terrorist act and being members of a terrorist group. The case is before chief Magistrate Francis Andayi. According to prosecution counsel Carole Sigei, there is enough evidence showing their involvement in the heinous attack. The suspects are alleged to have aided the terror attack which claimed 147 lives at Garissa University on April 2 2015. The National Assembly Security Committee report on the attack said Mustaf Ato sent money to a facilitator in Garissa to obtain weapons and ammunition from Jilib. The facilitator used two associates of Mustaf Ato named Hidig and Abu Ali to transport the weapons to Mandera. Hidig then assigned four individuals, Saha Diriye Hussein, Mohamed Abdi Abikar, Hassan Aden Hassan and Omar Dahir, to ferry the weapons to Garissa. "On March 24, the first pair of attackers, led by Khaled Hassan Issack, aka Jafar, arrived in Mandera," the report says. “They then proceeded to Garissa on March 26. By March 31, all the four attackers assembled in Garissa. They left their abode on April 2 and entered Garissa University College between 5:00 and 5:30 hours,” it further revealed. The committee was informed that the four terrorists involved in the attack were Abdirahim Abdullahi Mohamed, aka Ahmed (leader), Khaled Hassan Issack, aka Jafar (Abdirahim’s close associate), Muhamad, and Zarqawi.
