Nyeri MPs have been urged to work with Nyumba Kumi, chiefs and their assistants to identify children who have been unable to report to secondary schools and assist them. Nyeri Women Representative Rahab Mukami said these are the people who know the needy children in their areas. Many learners had not reported to school as the reporting date expired on Friday due to lack of fees. “Let us assist these children go to school because if we don’t, then their living standard will never improve,” she said. Mukami called on the legislators and the governor’s office to give priority to the needy saying there are a lot of children who are yet to join school due to lack of fees. She spoke during the issuance of Sh4 million bursary cheques at YMCA hall in Nyeri town on Friday. Some 460 learners benefited from the bursary from the National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF). She said more than 1000 learners had applied for bursary but only the 460 benefitted adding that she will forward the rest of the names to MPs and the governor’s office for consideration. Mukami said most of the children are orphans or their parents are sick and cannot raise fees. “We as elected leaders also have a responsibility of joining hands and ensure we play our part in assisting the government in making sure the children report to school,” she said. She called on members of public to forward cases of children who are still at home to her so she can look for ways of assisting them. The MP also urged school principals to allow children who will report late to enrol and for the ministry to ensure those reporting late are not sent back home.
