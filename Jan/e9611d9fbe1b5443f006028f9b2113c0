Civil servants frustrating government policies face dire consequences. Nyanza regional commissioner Moffat Kangi said it was unfortunate that some teachers were promoting strike activism even after the court ordered tutors to report to work when schools reopened on Thursday. He was referring to the Friday arrest of Kasau Primary School headteacher Samuel Agola for sending students home on Thursday. The school is in Bondo. Kangi said the government will ensure all pupils remain in schools and that the institutions are secured. Area assistant chief Margaret Ochinga was also arrested. Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed on Wednesday directed schools to open the following day. Kangi said Agola ordered the pupils to return home until further notice. “The misconduct by the headteacher is not only an infringement on the students’ right to education but also an affront to government education policies,” Kangi said on Saturday. He said Ochinga’s failure to ensure the school remains open for learning was negligence of duty and insensitivity to community needs. “In view of this level of misconduct, the government yesterday effected the arrests of Agola and Ochinga to record statements with police and be processed for prosecution,” he said.
