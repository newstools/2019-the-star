The 13-year-old girl who was defiled and mutilated in Homa Bay was transferred to Nairobi Women’s Hospital yesterday. The move followed an intervention by the state department of Gender and Social Services and local leaders, through the Kenya Women Parliamentary Association. The Standard 8 girl will undergo reconstructive surgery. Earlier surgery had been carried out at Homa Bay County Hospital to control excessive bleeding. Homa Bay county Hospital acting CEO Meshack Liru and Woman Representative Gladys Wanga said they expect the girl’s condition to improve. “To avoid rupture of the birth canal, the minor must undergo a medical procedure that will repair her damaged genitals,” Liru said. Wanga said, “The minor will have psychological counselling from professionals to help her recover.” Meanwhile, investigations are underway. The police on Wednesday arrested eight suspects in connection with the attack. They were detained at the Homa Bay police station for interrogations. “We have crucial information on the matter and expect arrest of more suspects. We’ll narrow down our investigations,” county police commander Marius Tum said.
