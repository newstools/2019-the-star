Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo yesterday asked politicians to give President Uhuru Kenyatta a chance to spread developments projects countrywide. Odhiambo said it was unfortunate for some Central leaders t claim the region has been neglected. He said Uhuru is a president for all Kenyans and not specific regions. “I’m shocked that MPs who should spearhead development in their regions are sulking just because the President visited Nyanza and commissioned a number of development projects,” Odhiambo said. The lawmaker said Uhuru is bound by the Constitution to serve and unite all Kenyans without any favour or political inclination. He spoke in Wagai in his constituency office. He asked politicians to stop bashing each other, saying it was time to concentrate on promises made to the electorate. There have been political bickering stoked by David Murathe who promised to block Ruto from running for president in 2022. Odhiambo asked the Supreme Court to give an advisory opinion on the matter.“It is not right for an individual who has served as the deputy president or deputy governor for a period of ten years to again vie for the position of president or governor,” he said.
