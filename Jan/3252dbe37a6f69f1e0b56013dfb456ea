Top artiste Karuga Kimani, alias KRG the Don, is advising his fellow artistes to produce quality music to get more airplay. The Don, who's known for his expensive music videos, told Word Is music is business and every business has a challenge, and it depends on how you approach it. "If you offer substandard content and want to be aired, then you will be forced to go beyond what you've offered," he said. "That's when corruption comes in because when you file quality content (like the way I do), nobody is going to ask you for money to play your music." The First Cash record label CEO said every music video has a different budget. "My most expensive video was 'Summertime' and 'Get wid it'. I did both videos back to back. They were both shot in Dubai, though part of 'Get wid it' was shot in Kenya. I spent Sh10 million." Don said most Kenyan music isn't going viral because of poor management. "We all need to get professionals to handle our business, because we as artistes, what we're lacking is the people to push the music and distribution companies," he said. Don said promoters are "a big letdown". "I don't why they should import artistes from outside to perform here. We're creating monsters out of them and we cannot create one out of what we have locally," he said. "Kenya has talent compared to Tanzania, but we don't get the support we need to beat these guys because they've flooded our market because of our radio stations. If we support our own, we will overflow foreign music."
