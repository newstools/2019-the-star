A 33-year old man was on Thursday jailed for 20 years by a Kilungu court in Makueni county for defiling a 15-year old girl. Charles Kimanthi, who appeared before senior resident magistrate Charles Mayamba, is said to have committed the offence in November last year at Mbondo Nzau village in Kaiti subcounty. "I am satisfied that the evidence before this court is sufficient and I have no doubt that the suspect committed the offence," Mayamba said in hisÂ ruling. Last year Mayamba jailed a 50-year old man for life for defiling a 15-year old girl. The same magistrate also sentenced a 30-year old man to 80 years in jail for defiling his five-year-old daughter. Reported cases of defilement have been on the rise in the area. Click here for the latest political news
