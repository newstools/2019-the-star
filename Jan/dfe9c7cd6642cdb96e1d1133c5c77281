Kabuchai constituency in Bungoma celebrated yesterday after the Supreme Court upheld the election of MP James Lusweti. The judges overturned the verdict of the Court of Appeal and declared the Ford Kenya MP was validly elected. Lusweti’s election in the 2017 polls was challenged by independent candidate Edward Tale. He was Lusweti’s closest rival and opposed the result on grounds of irregularities, including rigging. The Court of Appeal in Kisumu nullified Lusweti’s election on July 26 last year, saying the poll was marred by irregularities. Lusweti challenged the decision of appellate judges Erastus Githinji, Hannah Okwengu and Jamila Mohamed and petitioned the Supreme Court. Lusweti is serving his second term. He won 18,485 votes against Tale’s 18,062. Residents took to the streets of Chwele town singing and dancing in praise Lusweti and Ford Kenya.They said he is a development-oriented leader who has done much to uplift their living standards. Resident Ken Nyongesa of Mukuyuni ward said it has been tough for Lusweti who has been battling the case in court since election. “While our neighbours like Kimilili constituency have been progressing, our MP has been up and down trying to win the petition. We are now happy that has has triumphed,” he said. Nyongesa asked Tale to support Lusweti for development in Kabuchai before they face each other again in 2022. Kabuchai politician Majimbo Kalasinga who vied for MP in the last polls on a Jubilee ticket but lost welcomed the ruling. He said time for politicking is over and residents are yearning for meaningful development. He urged supporters of Tale and Lusweti to shake hands and work together. Tale had already moved to the Jubilee Party.
