The Mamboleo-Muhoroni road that links Kisumu, Nandi and neighbouring counties will be tarmacked this year, Muhoroni MP Onyango Koyoo said yesterday. He said the government had allocated money to tarmac the 36-kilometre C674 road. President Uhuru Kenyatta, during a tour of Kisumu and Siaya counties mid last month announced that the tender for the construction of the road had been awarded. Koyoo said three major projects - Mamboleo-Muhoroni road, Koru-Soin dam and revival of Chemelil, Muhoroni and Miwani sugar factories were given considerations by the President. The construction of the road will open up commerce in the neighbouring counties. Koyoo commended the President for his efforts to build the road and plans to revive the collapsed sugar industries. The 36km road is one of the 45 covering 2,000km the government plans to construct in form phase one of the annuity programmes. Others include Turkwa-Rumbwa and Masera-Muhuru Bay road in Ugenya and Nyatike constituencies. The MP asked the national government to expedite the construction of the Sh20 billion Koru-Soin dam. He called for proper public participation in development projects. The multi-purpose dam, whose construction was planned in the early 1980s, is expected to end water shortages in Kericho and Kisumu counties. But the local people are opposed to the construction of the dam for non-participation. The MP assured them that their views will be taken into considerations before the commencement of the construction. Koyoo said the dam, on completion, will address the flood menace and provide adequate water for domestic and irrigation use.
