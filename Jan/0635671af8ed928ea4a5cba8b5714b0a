The Coast Water Service Board is losing millions of shillings due to vandalism, CEO Jacob Torutt has said. On Thursday, Torrut said the board loses about 12 per cent of the non-revenue water because of vandals. “Vandalism is one of the major problems in our infrastructure. We are losing up to 12 per cent of our bulk water due to this problem,” said Torrut. He said international standards allow them to lose up to five per cent. He said residents in towns are at the danger of losing water when vandals break the pipes to steal metals for sale. He warned that vandals will be arrested and charged because police are on the alert.
