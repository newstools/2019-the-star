Miguna tweets juicy poisonous details. In the end, Raila was sworn in during a brief ceremony when his NASA allies were absent. _____________________________________________________ Car-free days plan sparks fear of chaos, muggings and losses For Jadiel Mwema, a hawker, car-free days in Nairobi as announced by the Transport ministry on Monday will be of no use to hawkers.
