The 52 people admitted to Longisa Hospital in Bomet on Thursday night after feasting on contaminated food were discharged on Saturday. The victims were 14 children, 29 women and nine men. Health executive Joseph Sitonik said the county will foot the bill. "We have released them and assured them they will not be charged any fee. The medics conducted final examinations in the morning which have shown they are out of danger," the official said. The group were part of mourners who had attended a funeral in Tabook village, Bomet county. They started developing complications after the ceremony and health officials were mobilised to visit the village. The victims complained of abdominal pains, vomiting and diarrhoea. Sitonik said investigations will be conducted to establish the cause of the poisoning. Click here for the latest political news
