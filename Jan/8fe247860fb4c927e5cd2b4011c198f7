Nurses in Kitui go on strike from Monday next week to
protest against the county government's failure to increase their service and uniform allowances. The Kenya National Union of Nurses Kitui branch secretary Newton Kimanzi on Monday told patients: "You will be on your own" as he called on their relatives to either transfer them elsewhere or take them home. The union accused the county government of failure to honour an agreement to increase the nurses' service and uniform allowance. Kimanzi said in a press statement: "We are calling upon relatives and next of kin of all patients admitted in all level 3 to 5 hospitals to make arrangement to pick or transfer their patients elsewhere on or before February 4, 2019, because all nurses will go on strike." The union had on January 14 issued a two-week strike notice to  the county government demanding service allowance that had be increased to Sh30,000 from Sh20,000, and a uniform allowance of Sh25,000 from Sh15,000. The union has 700 nurses in Kitui. County Chief Officer for Health and Sanitation Richard Muthoka said the money to pay the nurses is available but it cannot be released until the Salaries and Remuneration Commission gives its approval. Nurses across the country had gone on a strike in 2017. The labour dispute ended after a return to work agreement was reached in November of the same year. The agreement was to be effected in three phases from 2018 to 2020. The union said that nurses in Kitui have never received any increment. "We have held  several meetings with the administration in the County Health Ministry discussing several issues" without any implementation," the union said. The  nurses' other demands include promotion, confirmation to permanent and pensionable status, annual leaves, re-designation and promotion of one of their own as the county director of nursing services.
