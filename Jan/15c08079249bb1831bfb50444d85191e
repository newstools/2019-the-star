Police are holding a guard in their investigations of a syndicate that has been stealing equipment at the Migori County Referral Hospital. The officers have recovered equipment and supplies worth Sh4 million following a tip off from the public. Detectives trailed the guard to his home on New Year eve at about 11pm and found the equipment. “The guard’s home is in Oruba estate where officers recovered the equipment,” Migori police boss Patrick Macharia said. The equipment include an X-ray machine, theatre sanitary equipment, a fridge, TV set, computer and dozens of plastic chairs. Macharia said the guard will be taken to court when investigations are complete. Senior hospital officials have confirmed the recovered equipment were stolen from the facility. The officials recorded statements with police. “Security firms employing guards should conduct checks with police to avoid similar incidents in future,” Macharia said. Migori governor Okoth Obado has often complained of theft of drugs and equipment from public hospitals. He said the stolen items are often sold in neighbouring Tanzania.
