Embu Governor Martin Wambora and MCAs met in Nairobi last week to end a two-week stand-off.  Some MCAs told the Star they met for an entire day. Ruguru/Ngandori MCAs Harrison Muturi, who attended the meeting at Hotel La Mada, said they agreed on a ceasefire between the executive and the MCAs to promote services. Muturi said he hoped the governor would keep his word, adding that the assembly would also keep its end of the bargain. “The governor and elected ward representatives met so t we could see how to work together to improve our manifestos because we are all answerable to the voters,” Muturi said. Afterward he said he was certain both the executive, the legislature and the county government will work as a team.“I term it very successful meeting,” Muturi said. Nthawa MCA Nathan Mwari said that going forward there will be no push and pull between the executive and the legislature. When contacted for comment, Governor Wambora said they agreed to put political differences aside and focus on fast-tracking development. “Let Kenyans know we are not fighting now and that we shall be working for the benefit of the people. Prolonged fights are not usefuland really disappoint residents,” Wambora said. They had a handshake and agreed there will be ‘no negativity’, he said. They agreed to attend the next leaders’ peace building summit in February. The meeting comes against the backdrop of strained relations between the governor and the MCAs. They had recommended the sacking of two chief officers, Ruth Ndirangu (Finance) and Samuel Wachira (Youth and Sports) over alleged abuse of office and violation of law. Last week, Senator Njeru Ndwiga and nominated MP Cecily Mbarire urged the MCAs to stop the fights and support the governor in his development plans. Ndwiga urged the two sides to talk.
