Lecturers from University of Nairobi lecturers on Thursday backed Education CS Amina Mohamed's appointment of four deputy vice chancellors. UASU secretary George Omondi,Â who read a statement on their behalf, told the press at the university the deputy VCs should start work immediately. They are Prof Mohamud Jama (Finance, Planning and Development), Prof William Ogara (Human Resource and Administration), Prof Lydia Njenga (Research, Production and Extension) and Prof Julius Ogengo (Academic Affairs). The DVCs were expected to begin work by January 15 but were delayed by leadership wrangles. A row has been brewing after the University Council rejected the names. The Council claimed CS Mohamed bypassed the names of candidates it had recommended after they emerged top in interviews done between January 7 and 9. The dispute landed in the office Attorney General Kihara Kariuki's office for an advisory opinion. However, the lecturers said the CS neither broke the law nor contravened policy with respect to the appointments. "The university has many challenges that require immediate and priority attention. These include financial constraints, infrastructural deficiencies, stalled staff promotions and collapsed staff medical scheme among others," Omondi said. He said the Council and senior management should focus on these issues not petty squabbles and protests. Click here for the latest political news
