The government on Wednesday reshuffled regional coordinators. The changes were announced in a press statement signed by Interior CS Fred Matiang'i in Mombasa. The new coordinators are John Elungata (Coast), Wilfred Nyagwanga (Central), Anne Ng'etich (Western), Mongo Chimwaga (Rift Valley), James Kianda (Nyanza), Wilson Njega (Nairobi), Isaiah Nakoru (Eastern) and Mohamed Birik (North Eastern). In the changes, Nairobi Regional Commissioner William Kang'ethe has been promoted as principal administrative secretary while Eastern Regional Commissioner Wycliffe Ogallo will be secretary for national administration. Nyanza Regional Commissioner Moffat Kangi has been promoted to secretary for internal security while Peter Thuku has deployed as secretary peacebuilding and conflict management. "It is necessary from time to time to strengthen and enhance our leadership both at the headquarters and in the field," the statement read. Matiang'i said the deployments take place with immediate effect. These are the second major changes at the ministry under Matiang'i. The first reshuffle for county and regional commissioners was done in February 2018. The changes come a week after regional police commanders were reshuffled. The new regional police bosses announced by IG Joseph Boinnet last week are expected to report at their workstations by January 15. Last year, President Uhuru Kenyatta restructured the police service to improve security and services. Click here for the latest political news
