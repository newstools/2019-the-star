Former Kiambu governor Willliam Kabogo is contemplating vying for the presidency in 2022. Kabogo said he is ready to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta "as I see things getting mixed up right now". He was referring to the squabbling in the ruling Jubilee party. Kabogo spoke during a talk show on Citizen Television on Wednesday night. "Who gets to decide who becomes the President? it is the people of Kenya," he said. He dismissed the narrative that the president will determine who would succeed him, saying "he has only one vote." "Kabogo Presidency is a possibility," he said. Kabogo said his approach to the corruption scourge in the country would be ruthless, confronting the rings that swindle public resources without mercy. "My presidency would be good to many, bad for a few. But I'd create a lot of enemies," he added. This is not the first time Kabogo has declared interest on the country's top seat. In June last year, he told the Star that he is “fully back” and will play a key role in shaping Kenya’s future. In 2016, Kabogo apologised to Ruto over remarks he made saying Kikuyus will not automatically support the latter's presidential bid. Kabogo was quoted saying that Mt Kenya voting bloc does not guarantee support for the DP in 2022 since he (Kabogo) was also intending to be in the race of the top seat.
