The US Embassy on Friday issued a security alert, reminding the public to stay vigilant in public spaces such as shopping malls, hotels, and places of worship. The warning comes after the Dusit terror attack last Tuesday which claimed 21 lives. Through their Twitter account on Friday, the embassy asked the public to be aware of their surroundings and stay alert in locations frequented by tourists and Westerners. It also advised foreigners to have their travel documents up to date and easily accessible. The public was also advised to review their personal security plans. The terror group al Shabaab, which claimed responsibility, said the attack was in retaliation of US President Donald Trump's decision to declare Jerusalem the capital city of Israel.
