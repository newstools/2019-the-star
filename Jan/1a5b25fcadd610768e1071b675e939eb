Rapper Msupa S has accused her manager Tomi Motto of posting images on her Instagram account to tarnish her name. “I went to record music in another studio because I felt he is manipulating me, and that is where the beef started,” Msupa S told Word Is yesterday. The post, which has since been deleted, showed her kissing an unidentified man who Msupa S finally said was her manager. “That was a long time ago and that picture was not meant to be,” she said. “He has also been forcing me to be in a relationship with him. I was taking a pic and he forced me to have one and after that, I deleted the picture on my phone but I did not know that he had kept it in his phone. He is becoming petty but there is nothing going on between me and him.”
