A human rights group is up in arms over the killing of a 23-year-old youth at Mwembe Kuku in Mombasa on Tuesday night. Shaffi Salim Shaffi was shot dead by police during an operation. Human rights group Haki Africa told the Star in Wednesday plain clothed and police in uniform were involved in the shooting. Previously, police had linked Shaffi and other youths to criminal activities in Mwembe Tayari, Kisauni, Mtwapa and Bamburi. "Haki Africa is concerned over the rising number of police killings of youths in Mombasa. We will be taking this matter to IPOA and higher authorities for further investigations," Haki Africa director Hussein Khalid. "Security authorities, religious and political leaders should look into the rampant killings. Too many young lives are being lost. More needs to be done to address the issue." Urban police boss Eliud Monari said Shaffi and his accomplices have many theft cases pending in court. "They have been stealing from the public for a long time,” he said. Monari said the police also found heroin and machetes during the raid. An accomplice was arrested and another escaped. Shaffi will be buried on Wednesday evening at Kikowani cemetery.
