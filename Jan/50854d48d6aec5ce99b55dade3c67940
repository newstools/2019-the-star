Majority leader Aden Duale has asked Muslims to ignore Supreme Court decision that Muslim students are not allowed to wear hijabs in non-Muslim schools. Duale said the ruling takes away the rights of Muslim girls as stipulated in the constitution. Speaking in Garissa on Saturday, Duale faulted the Apex court for not taking into consideration the right to worship as provided for in the constitution. The Garissa Town MP said Muslims will ignore the ruling and have their children wear the outfit in schools as per the teachings of the Quoran, because "no one has the right to interfere with it". "Who are apex Judges to order on Hijabs? They should be aware they are a creation of the constitution that has also given every Kenyan right to worship," Duale said. "We the Muslims will continue to have our children in school with hijabs,” he added. The legislator said Kenyans have the right to practice what their religious ascribes to and Muslims are not exceptional.

The Supreme Court on Thursday overturned a Court of Appeal ruling allowing Muslim students to wear Hijab in school. The three students were suspended in 2014 by St Paul's Kiwanjani Secondary School in Isiolo for wearing the head covering worn by Muslim women. The ruling has elicited sharp reaction among Muslims faithful.
