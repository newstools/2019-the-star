World marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge is among six sportsmen nominated for the 2018 Laureus World Sportsman of the Year. Kipchoge was nominated alongside Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton, tennis world No 1 Novak Djokovic and NBA great LeBron James. Other nominees for the award are FIFA World Cup Golden Ball winner Modric and FIFA Best Young Player Mbappé in what promises to be a hotly contested race. On January 11, Kipchoge was named the 2018 Safaricom Sports Personality of the Year. He was crowned in a colourful ceremony at Mombasa’s Fort Jesus as organisers moved the event outside Nairobi for the first time since its inception 15 years ago. Kipchoge hit headlines in the world when he shattered the world record to time 2:01:39 after winning the 2018 Berlin Marathon. The Olympic Marathon champion started the year strongly with victory at the London Marathon in 2:04:17 seconds on April 22, which was the 15th fastest time over the distance.
