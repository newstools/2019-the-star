A group of people on Friday raided Kamakwa MCA John Ndumia’s butchery in Nyeri town and demanded payment for the meat they supplied. They paralysed business at the premises. They splashed water on the meat. Their action attracted a huge presence of onlookers. The group included former employees who demanded their salary arrears. They said they were not paid for months. Efforts to get Ndumia’s comment were unsuccessful. His phone was switched off. Patrick Ndirangu said he supplied Sh23,400 meat in October last year but was not paid. He arrived at the butchery at 11am. “He approached me and requested me to be supplying meat. Initially, he paid well and earned my trust but after sometimes he stopped paying,” he said. “I’ve realised this man is problematic. He doesn’t even pay his workers.” Ndirangu said the second-term MCA has not been returning his calls. They said the MCA has been threatening them whenever they ask for their money. They warned that the business will not run until they get their cash. “We shall camp here even if it is for one year to ensure he does not operate until he pays our money,” Ndirangu said. Supplier Macharia Wang’ombe said he is owed Sh10,000. He accused the MCA of making “empty promises” for the past six months. They want the police to arrest the ward representative or they will take the law into their own hands and cart away the stock. George Gitonga demanded Sh27,000 for three months work. Ndumia threatens to have him arrested every time he calls to enquire about the money, he said. Gitonga worked at the butchery and was later transferred to another outlet in Ruring’u.
