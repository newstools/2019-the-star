Kilifi lawmakers have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to tame Jubilee deputy vice-chairman David Murathe to show his commitment to the March 9, 2018 handshake. Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa, Woman Representative Gertrude Mbeyu and nominated senator Christine Zawadi yesterday said Murathe’s call for Deputy President William Ruto to retire with Uhuru in 2022 could cause disunity. They said the handshake cannot bear fruits if leaders are allowed to make divisive statements. Murathe said Mt Kenya does not owe Ruto political debt. The lawmakers, who were speaking at Charo Ngoma near Kilifi town, told Uhuru and Opposition chief Raila Odinga to tame their allies. Jumwa said Murathe’s remarks could spoil the union between Ruto and Uhuru. “I would like to tell the President and ODM party leader that the statement by Murathe may affect the handshake,” Jumwa said. Zawadi said Murathe was spoiling the peace of the handshake. Read: Uhuru distances himself from Murathe on Ruto retirement remark Click here for the latest political news
