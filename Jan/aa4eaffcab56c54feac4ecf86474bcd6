A Thika-based bishop on Sunday sneaked away from his church after members of his controversial sacco camped in the compound to demand their savings. David Ngari commonly known as Gakuyo is the owner of Ekeza Savings and Credit Cooperative Society. Members said they applied for withdrawal of funds in 2017 after word went round the sacco was collapsing due to fraud. The irate group camped Calvary Chosen Center hoping to get Ngari to tell them when their money will be released. But Ngari declined to address the group and instead drove off in an unmarked vehicle after the church service was over. Members claimed the bishop used their money finance his campaigns during the 2017 elections when Ngari expressed interest in Kiambu governorship. Ngari later dropped his bid, opting to formed the United for Kiambu Movement that supported Governor Ferdinand Waititu. “We saved our money on promises of many benefits including getting a piece of land at a relatively cheaper price,” Bernard Irungu said. Irungu said he has a total of Sh285,000 in savings held by the sacco. He said he was considering taking Ngari to court. He said he requested for a Sh30,000 loan which was declined before he decided to withdraw all his savings. “I made the withdrawal request in January 2017 and was told to wait for 60 working days. But up to now they haven’t released the money,” Irungu said. George Njuguna with Sh282,000 in savings said he cannot pay school fees because the funds are held up. “I joined the sacco because Ngari is a man of God and I felt that my money would be safe,” Njuguna said. Boda boda rider Robert Mathenge has saved Sh95,000 and was promised land by the Gakuyo Real Estate, a firm owned by Ngari. “I didn’t get the land and now they’ve withheld my savings. This is a big injustice,” Mathenge said. Ngari promised to release a statement on the matter yesterday but had not done so by press time.
