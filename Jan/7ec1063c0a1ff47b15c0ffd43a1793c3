The Bondo subcounty hospital is on the spot after a woman died while undergoing an operation at the facility. Mary Adhiambo, 26,  passed away last Sunday after she gave birth through caesarean section. The newborn survived the operation. Adhiambo's family, however, claims her death was due to negligence by the facility's management. Family and friends of the deceased are now demanding answers from the hospital. Lawrence Onyango, the husband to the deceased, claims the hospital staff are not transparent about the matter. Onyango, a boda boda operator in Bondo town, said his wife was operated on by “trainee nurses”. "The last time I saw my wife alive was at around 6 pm on Sunday as doctors kept on telling me that my wife was in the theatre and that there was no cause for alarm," he said. The hospital's management said they are conducting an inquiry into the death and a team has already been assembled to look into the matter. The hospital's Medical Superintendent Willis Ochieng said the doctors tried their best to save Adhiambo's life. “It is true we lost a patient on Sunday but I will only be able to give details of what could have happened after an audit,” Ochieng said. Ochieng, said he regretted the death but stated that preliminary findings indicate that the woman died as a result of excessive bleeding. He further denied reports that the operation was done by unqualified personnel, saying there was a team of nine doctors who tried to save her life. “We took the woman to the theatre for the second time after realising abnormal bleeding but she did not make it out of the theatre alive,” Ochieng said.
