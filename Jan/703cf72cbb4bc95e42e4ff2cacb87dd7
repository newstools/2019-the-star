Sports Personality of the Year Awards yesterday received Sh3m from Communications Authority of Kenya towards the event planned for next week at Fort Jesus, Mombasa This is the ninth consecutive year that CA is supporting Soya Awards and in the spirit of celebrating the 15th edition of the sports Gala, they have increased their sponsorship by 50 percent from Sh2m in 2017. Tom Olwero, the director of frequency spectrum management, said CA associates with the objectives of the event, which include identifying and nurturing sports talents across sports disciplines. “We believe in the spirit of sportsmanship and appreciate the hard work that sportsmen and women put into their training. Over the years, we have seen young boys and girls recognised under the Most Promising category go on to win medals at major international events. This does not only show that Kenya has abundant talent, but it is also possible to identify such talent at an early age and cheer them on to success,” said Olwero, commending the Paul Tergat Foundation for their commitment to support the development of sports. “Talent identification and mentorship remain the main areas in nurturing talent that uses sports as an instrument of national cohesion and economic growth,” added Olwero. The 1988 Seoul Olympic marathon silver medalist and Soya Awards brand ambassador, Douglas Wakiihuri said the move to shift the event to Mombasa was good for tourism. “We have run in many coastal cities but most of our athletes have not been to Mombasa. This will give them a feel of their own coast. Having been born in Mombasa, I would like to see Mombasa grow in athletics. We celebrate this partnership as we fete our country’s ambassadors for their exemplary performances,” noted Wakihuri.
