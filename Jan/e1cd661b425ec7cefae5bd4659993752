Thirty parents in Athi River were yesterday arrested for failing to take their children to school. They are from Kanaani slum. The parents were picked up in an operation conducted by Mavoko chief Nzau Komo with the help of officials from Athi River Children’s Department and community policing members. The crackdown was conducted after Athi River deputy county commissioner David Juma last weekend directed chiefs to ensure all parents take their children to school. Mavoko Children’s officer Elijah Mutie said most children roam the slum and parts of Athi River town. “Some parents claim that education is expensive while there are more than five public primary schools in Athi River town and its environs,” Mutie said. The parents arrested have children aged 5-15 years.
