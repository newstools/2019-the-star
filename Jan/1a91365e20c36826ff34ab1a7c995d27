A Kabarnet family has lost hope of finding the body of an 11-year-old son killed by a hippo in Lake Baringo. Fabricas Kemboi was attacked on Sunday evening as he swam with his age-mates. Only his right arm was recovered on the shoreline. A rescue team has been unable to locate his body. Kemboi was a Standard 5 pupil. Yesterday, his father David Kiplagat thanked the team for their help. “At least efforts were made to recover my son’s body. If it goes missing, as a family we’ll have no option but surrender. We might decide to end the tiresome process and just take his arm for burial.” Senior county KWS warden Dickson Tonui said the search will continue until they recover the body. “Our only worry is that crocodiles may feast on the body. Otherwise hippos only bite to kill but can’t eat humans,” he said. On Monday, residents, accompanied by KWS officials, killed the hippo. Residents turned it into a delicacy. Rhoda Chebet, 65, said they are tired of vegetables. “We can’t lose everything. At least we have to take the meat of this bloodless beast,” she said. Lake Baringo warden Jackson Komen said it is normal to kill a wild animal that has tasted human blood.
