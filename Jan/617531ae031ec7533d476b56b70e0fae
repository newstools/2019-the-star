A Milimani court on Friday summoned a police officer to explain how he took three traders to court on two different charge sheets. Inspector Eric Mureithi of Economic Crimes Unit registered two different files with the same charges against the three suspects. The suspects are businessmen Jajeev Modi, Pushpinder Mann and Jophece Yogo who are the directors of Galot Manchester Outfitters and King Woolen Mills limited companies. They are accused of perjury and false swearing before an advocate. The three appeared before senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku where a plea deferral was obtained by their lawyer, Kirathe Wandugi. Mutuku had postponed their plea taking for seven days to await the response by DCI George Kinoti and DPP Noordin Haji after Wandugiâ€™s application. The complainant is Pravin Galot who has sued his brothers. Wandugi said he has written to Kinoti and Haji seeking letters on the registration of the three firms. He said the letters will establish that Galot lacks capacity to claim ownership if he is not listed as a director of the firms. Wandugi found out that his clients were listed for plea taking in another court. The prosecution was about to seek a warrant of arrest against the three for failing to appear in court before Wandugi intervened. Their file had been placed before senior resident magistrate Hellen Onkwani, who was about to issue the summons. Click here for the latest political news
