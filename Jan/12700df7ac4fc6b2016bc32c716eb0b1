Friends of Ali Salim Gichunge who has been linked to the DusitD2 complex terror attack on Tuesday have are shocked that the man who left Isiolo in 2015 was involved. They said Gichunge was born and bred in Kulamawe, Bulapesa ward, in Isiolo county and described him as a God-fearing, loving and outgoing person who never engaged in any unlawful activities. Moses Kinyua, a childhood friend, said he was only one class ahead of the terrorist at Hekima Primary School in Isiolo. He said Gichunge was bright in school and expressed dismay at the news that his friend was involved in terrorism. He sent condolences to the families of those who died and wished quick recovery to the injured. Waso location Chief James Chuchu said Gichunge’s family lived peacefully with their neighbours, adding that not a single complaint was ever lodged against any member. Gichunge’s father Abdallah Salim who works as a driver with the Department of Defence in Isiolo town abandoned the family many years ago, leaving the mother, Sakina Mariam, to take care of the children. Miriam was arrested by officers from the DCI, questioned at the Isiolo Anti-Terror Police offices and later taken to Nairobi for further interrogation.
