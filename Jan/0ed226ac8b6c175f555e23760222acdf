Kiambu Youth Affairs executive Karungo Wa Thang'wa has said he once chose his dreadlocks over an anchor job for a top media house in Kenya. "I passed the auditions to read news on TV, but they told me I had to get rid of my hair, which was dreadlocks," Karungo told Word Is on Friday. Karungo says he was only 25 years and enjoying his youth immediately after coming from China, where he was a lecturer. "Although I had a job on radio, I wanted to look for greener pastures. That is why I went for a TV interview. After the conditions they gave me, I asked myself if I cut the hair, will I look photogenic? I had to forego the job and keep my hair," he said. He kept the locks for 10 years before he decided to get rid of them. "I had them for two years from China because there was no good barber to take care of my hair. I went back to China and they employed me with my hair, and I stayed with them for a further 10 years," he said. Last week, a Kibera girl was rejected in school over dreadlocks and was told to choose between the hair and books. Education CS Amina Mohamed intervened, saying she should remain in school. Karungo backed the CS. "Every school has its rules and regulations but nobody should be discriminated against because of their culture or religion. As long as they are tidily made and not affecting other students, then the child has no reason not to be allowed in school," he said.
