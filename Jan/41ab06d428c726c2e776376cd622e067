The Recce officer killed during the Dusit hotel terror attack will be buried on Saturday in Kimala village, Taita Taveta county. An advert posted in today’s dailies by the government said the burial service for Japhet Nuru, 26, will start at 10am in Taita sub-county. “It is with deep sorrow that we announce the sudden passing on of Japhet Nuru of the National Police Service (GSU headquarters) on Wednesday 16/1/19 during the terrorist attack at Dusit,” read the advert. Nuru was among the elite officers who rescued more than 700 people after five terrorists attacked the Dusit facility last Tuesday at 3pm. A total of 21 people died while scores were left injured. “Fare thee well our Kenyan hero,” said the statement. Nuru is the son of Wilfred Nuru Lukeki and Lydia Asha Lengaki. The main fundraiser will be held on Wednesday. “Contributions may be channelled to M-Pesa pay bill number 566010 A/C no Japhet Funeral Fund,” the advert says.
