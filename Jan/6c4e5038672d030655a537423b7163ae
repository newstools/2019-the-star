A former teacher suspected of confining a 17-year-old student in Huruma was yesterday arraigned in a Makadara court. Everline Awour Omolo was arrested on January 14 after Mohamed Adan, a relative, reported that the student had been missing from her school in Huruma on September 24 last year. Awuor was to be detained for seven days at Pangani police station to allow police to investigate but the court released her on bail. Adan said the student had been missing for the entire third school term until he reported the matter on January 10. She was later found at Awour’s house where she had been staying. Investigating officer Michael Mulee said the girl had allegedly been transferred to three schools by the suspect. She disappeared from her first school where the suspect was a teacher. If Awour is charged, she faces an offense of wrongfully concealing or keeping in confinement a kidnapped or abducted person. Through her lawyer, Awour told court that she took the girl herself to Huruma police station. She said she will cooperate if released on a cash bail. “I was a good samaritan to the girl after we met at the school where I was teaching. The girl had physical pain requiring medication and I offered to help,” she told court. The victim alleged she had been tortured by family members, Awour said Senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji released her on a cash bail of Sh20,000. The case will be mentioned on January 22.
