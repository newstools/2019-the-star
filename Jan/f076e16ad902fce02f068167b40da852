The government will start buying rice directly from farmers in Mwea sub county, Kirinyaga county, from the beginning of this year. This will ensure rice farmers in Mwea rice growing belt have access to ready market. Mwea MP Kavinga Wachira said the government has allocated Sh1 billion annually to buy rice in the area. Wachira said the inclusion of rice in the Strategic Food Reserve will not only provide market but also improve prices. He said the new arrangement will get rid of unscrupulous traders who for a long time exploited the farmers . The legislator said farmers will now deliver their produce to the National Cereals and Produce Board. He also said he will table a motion seeking to outlaw selling of horticultural crops such as tomatoes using crates. He said the bill specifies that traders will be forced to use weighing machines rather than crates, which is exploitive. “The use of weighing machines will be a big advantage to the farmers since they will receive the actual value of their crop,” Wachira said. Wachira was speaking at Makutano area in Mwea West sub county during the burial of Antony Chege, brother to Mutithi ward MCA Peter Njomo, who died in a road accident along Makutano-Sagana highway Wachira said he required the designer of the section of the highway to explore possibilities of erecting road bumps to avoid more deaths. He said the Ngurubani - Embu and Makutano Sagana road section should be declared as black spot. The MP added that Kirinyaga county was solidly behind President Uhuru Kenyatta who has been instrumental in the provision of Sh200 million waiver for rice farmers.
