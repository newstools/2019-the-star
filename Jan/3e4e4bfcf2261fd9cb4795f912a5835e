The future of Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa and her Msambweni counterpart Suleiman Dori in ODM will be known in February, party leader Raila Odinga said on Saturday. Odinga held a meeting with a section of party MCAs from Kilifi and Mombasa in his house but distanced himself from the subject of Jumwa and Dori, saying it would be resolved by the partyâ€™s National Executive Council and the Governing council. The ODM party leader said the NEC would have a sitting next month and later in February the Governing Council will make the final decision. His statement ended speculations that Odinga had come to Coast to announce the expulsion of his former strong ally Jumwa from the party, which could lead to a by-election. After pictures were posted on social media showing Odinga and the Kilifi leaders, a strong debate emerged in different platforms about a possible by-election. While Raila met Kilifi leaders, Jumwa was meeting over 1,000 youths from three wards in her constituency at her home in Kakuyuni. The vocal MP has said she is not worried about a by-election or being expelled from the party.
