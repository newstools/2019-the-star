A high powered delegation from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) is in the country to assess Kenya’s preparedness for the World Under-20 Championship slated for next year. The meetings with top government officials is slated for today and tomorrow. According to Athletics Kenya (AK), a high level delegation of 14 officials include—IAAF’s head of event operations Toni Jorba, executive director of communications Jackie Brock-Doyle, chief information officer An Dang Duy along with technical delegates Gemma Castano and Imre Matrahaz. Others are—Frederick Sanchez, the IAAF platforms and distribution operations manager, Mark Fulton, who is the executive producer for IAAF productions and Luis Saladie, the IAAF’s head of competitions. The IAAF delegation will have consultative meetings with Ministry of Sports and Heritage led by Cabinet Secretary Hon. Rashid Echesa, Principal Secretary Amb. Kirimi Kaberia, and Athletics Kenya’s executive led by President, Lt. Gen. (Rtd) Jackson Tuwei. Tuwei termed the meeting key in assessing Kenya’s preparedness for the championship. “This visit is extremely important for Kenya and will effectively kick off an extremely important leg of our preparations to host yet another successful global competition,” added Tuwei Kenya was last year awarded hosting rights for the 2020 IAAF World Under-20 Championships after the successful organisation of the 2017 IAAF World U-18 Championships at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The government has set aside Sh1.5 billion for the IAAF World Under 20 Championship. CS Echesa was supposed to have set up a Local Organsising Committee for the championship in August but this is yet to materialise. Kenya will be seeking to defend the overall crown won last year in Tampere Finland, where the country bagged six gold, four silver and a bronze medal.
