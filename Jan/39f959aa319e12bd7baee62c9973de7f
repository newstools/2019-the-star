Governor Ferdinand Waititu has come to the defense of President Uhuru Kenyatta against attacks that he had sidelined his home county. “We have projects that are going on from the national government like the SGR which will pass in Ndeiya where we are constructing an industrial park, we have roads though they are not complete, we have dams and other projects but we should not be seen advertising to the world,” Waititu said. Waititu was speaking on Friday during an interview by a vernacular radio station. He said that Kiambu people should not dare speak since there were a lot of projects initiated by the national government which should be embraced and not advertised. Waititu said that leaders should desist from inciting the public but rather do their work and also show the people what they have done. “As leaders we need to show our people what we are doing on the ground as we will be judged by our performance rather than attacking our President,” Waititu said. Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria on December 31, in Thika stadium lashed out at the President saying that he has not developed his home county. He said the county had been sidelined on allocation of resources. However there have been different reactions among residents with many saying that Kuria had spoken the bitter truth which the leaders have not been able to speak publicly. “Its a shame that our President came to Kiambu to issue certificates to recovering alcohol addicts yet in other counties he is commissioning and opening up new projects,” asked Joseph Ngugi, a resident. “Moses Kuria has aired our views and now he is being attacked by leaders defending the President for their own selfish interests,” Alice Wangonyo said.
