The Garissa government has defended itself against a Controller of Budget report that indicated it did not allocate any funds for development from the Sh1.08 billion it received. In a statement by county head of communication Eliud Mirin’gu, the county said it has initiated several development projects that are ongoing within that period. “In this financial year alone, the county has sunk 14 boreholes in Garissa Town subcounty and others in Fafi, Dadaab and Balambala, started the construction work for county headquarters and two subcounty offices in Fafi and Ijara, just to mention a few,” the report read in part. The law stipulates that counties should set aside at least 30 per cent of their allocation to development. According to the COB, only Sh3.5 billion went to development.
