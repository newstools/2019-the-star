Enterprising triplets Amos, Samson and Gideon Yegon are set to lead St. Patrick’s High School team in the annual Iten chess Open tournament to be held at their backyard this weekend. The triplets, who joined the school this year, were introduced to chess by Shem Vilembwa, the 2017 Team Kenya head coach at Africa Youth Chess Championships, where Kenya won gold in the Under-12 category. Vilembwa noticed the potential in the trio following their extra-ordinary features after they recorded five marks difference in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE). The three will be joined by top school chess players Vincent Kipkoech and Deng Anei who all played at the 2018 Africa Youth Chess Championships. Kipkoech finished third overall at the Africa Under-18 in Egypt. Experienced teacher Vilembwa, who was the Team Kenya coach at the 2015 Africa Youth Chess Championships in Zambia, said the triplets have the potential to improve in the game as the school puts more emphasis on sports. “I saw the potential in the boys and I decided to take up the task of training them. So far, so good and I expect them to anchor the team to the overall title at the championships,” said the coach. He added that the boys have plans of playing quality chess and have the ambition to take their chess career to the next level. “They are great players, sharp and intelligent and these are qualities of a good chess player. We expect them to play quality chess and we can’t wait to see what they can do on Saturday,” added Vilembwa. Besides chess, the event will also feature volleyball, handball, hockey, basketball rugby7s and rugby15s.
