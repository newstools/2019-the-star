Baringo youths on Tuesday said they support Jubilee but have not seen the fruits. They endorsed Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria's statement. The outspoken MP said President Uhuru Kenyatta has not given Central Kenya the development it deserves. The youths said at a press conference in Kabarnet town development is "slowed and discriminative". They blamed it on the handshake between the President and ODM leader Raila Odinga. “We wholesomely voted for Jubilee in 2013 and 2017, but our roads are poor roads and we lack water. Other people are benefitting, it seems like a game is being played somewhere,” youth Robert Kipkorir said. However, Uhuru has dismissed his critics. "Kenya is bigger and every citizen deserves an equal share of resources irrespective of political affiliation or tribe, and that is the leadership we want," he said. The DP has been accused of commissioning ambitious projects in Baringo that are yet to be implemented. Kipkorir said the handshake could be a ploy to frustrate the DP from succeeding Uhuru. The youths said if the President has decided to run the government without involving DP, it is better for it to be dissolved and “fresh elections called”. Another youth, Franklin Toroitich, said DP Ruto is the kingpin of Rift Valley politics and he deserves respect as Jubilee’s deputy party leader. Almaida Ayabei, another youth, said the President made an agreement with Ruto who was to take over from him. He said the community supported Uhuru twice so they don’t expect someone from Central Kenya to insult DP Ruto. Click here the latest political news
