A 48-year-old patient at Nanyuki Teaching and Referral hospital attacked and killed another patient and injured eight more in a fit. Diabetes patient Ronny Kaburu, 42, died after he was hit by a metal rod used to support a drip system, Laikipia Health Executive Lenai Kamario said. Kaburu, from Meru county, was attacked alongside six other patients and two nurses on duty. “The attacker, who had been admitted at the hospital on Wednesday last week, was suffering from epilepsy and hypertension,” Kamario said. “On that particular night at around 11.30pm, he developed sudden violent behaviour and attacked other patients and nurses.” Security personnel, police officers and health workers acted swiftly and subdued the patient, whose identity was not immediately revealed. Medics are managing him and he will be examined by a psychiatrist, the executive said. “As an institution, we have met with the security team and the deceased’s relatives after the incident, and we convey our condolences to the family and wish quick recovery to the staff and patients injured,” Kamario said.
