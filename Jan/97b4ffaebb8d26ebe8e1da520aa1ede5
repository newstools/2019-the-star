Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula has said he will form the next government after the 2022 general election. Wetang’ula said he will either form government or join others in government. The Bungoma senator said he will ensure Luhyas are not left in the Opposition cold any more. ”We have the numbers and what it takes to produce the country’s next president,” Wetang’ula said n Saturday. He was speaking at the funeral of AC Butonge Secondary School principal Vincent Wekesa’s three children. Wekesa’s son and two daughters died in a road accident at Makutano area along the Kanduyi-Chwele road on December 24. The three were on a motorcycle headed home after Christmas shopping from Bungoma town when the accident happened. Wetang’ula said Luhyas should not relegate themselves to playing second fiddle to communities with smaller population. He said sharing of national resources must consider population. He was optimistic that the August national census will put Luhya community on top in population. “We agree with the formula that will be used for counting our people. Not the old way where they cooked figures to favour some regions,” he said. Wetang’ula said the census results will be used to determine money allocated to counties for development. The senator said the census will be done using a biometric system. “Some con men are telling people that if you put your fingers on the biometric system then you are a criminal and will be arrested. That’s a lie,” he said and asked residents to ensure they were counted with their families. Kakamega and Bungoma counties are among the most populous in the country. “Kakamega was the second most populous county with 1.8 million people while Bungoma was number three with 1.6 million, according to the 2009 census. We believe these numbers have risen,” Wetang’ula said. Also at the function were Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati, MPs John Waluke, Dan Wanyama, Mwambu Mabonga and Catherine Wambilianga.
