Fast-rising Tusker forward Sydney Ochieng is an ambitious man after his brace inspired the Brewers to a cruising 2-0 win over Vihiga United on Wednesday in their fifth SportPesa Premier League match of the season and their first in the year. The high flying start by the striker has seen him express interests in gunning for the player of the month award for January which he believes is his to bottle. His double was enough to send Tusker to third position on the log with 10 points—one shy of second placed Western Stima and three off leaders Mathare United. The former Palos striker opened the scoring proceedings in the 15th minute and completed his brace five minutes later but his quest to add more was cut short as coach Robert Matano rested him for Peter Nzuki minutes after the restart. However, he believes his hard work and goal hunger in the forthcoming matches will bridge him to the award which the recipient is voted for by a panel of sports journalists. “I am happy to begin the year with a brace and I am looking forward to add more in the next assignments. I have a dream of winning the Player of the Month award for January which I strongly believe will be mine besides helping my team to maintain a winning streak. It’s possible through hard work.” Matano attributed the striker’s resurgence to his adherence to instructions and heaped praises on the club’s new signings whom he noted have gelled well with the rest of the players. Ochieng was largely overlooked for starting roles last season with Matano, preferring him as a substitute but the budding player has produced outstanding performance this season and boasts of three goals in five matches. “I am happy. Ochieng has come of age after counselling him for long and I hope he will carry his form in the next matches. He is showing maturity and his hard work and dedication has improved immensely this season. Equally I am pleased with the quality of the new players who are gelling well in the team.”
