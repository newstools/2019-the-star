The construction of a Sh1.28 billion water project in Homa Bay county will begin in two weeks time. The project is in Kendu Bay and Oyugis towns in Kachuonyo and Kasipul constituencies. The Kendu Bay town water project will cost Sh580 million, while that of Oyugis town will cost Sh705 million. The works will include construction of water kiosks and ablution blocks. The projects are funded by the African Development Bank in collaboration with the National government and Homa Bay county. They are implemented through the Nakuru-based Rift Valley Water Services Board.
