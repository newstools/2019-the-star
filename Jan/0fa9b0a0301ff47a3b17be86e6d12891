A 10-year-old boy was on Friday evening shot dead at Chesogon center, West Pokot county. Confirming the incident, West Pokot police commander Mathews Kuto, said the boy who was from school, was killed by armed bandits who sprayed him with bullets before they fled. "The bandits only shot him but they didn't steal any livestock," Kuto said. The police boss urged locals not to retaliate and give security officers time to pursue and arrest the culprits. "Police officers are on the ground to calm the situation. We are investigating on the incident," Kuto said. Pokot central subcounty deputy county commissioner Were Simiyu said the suspected bandits were from the neighbouring community. "We need to know the reason behind the killing of an innocent child who was from school and was even wearing his school uniform," he said. The incident comes a few days after elders and security officials from West Pokot, Baringo, and Elgeyo Marakwet counties held a security meeting in Elgeyo Marakwet county. The leaders deliberated on ways of ending cattle rustling along the border of the three counties. Click here for the latest political news
