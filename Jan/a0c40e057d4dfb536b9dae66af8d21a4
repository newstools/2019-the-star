A policeman captured on video assaulting a civilian has been arrested, Zimbabwe police say. The officer identified as Constable Mukamire was part of a group of three officers recorded on Saturday by a Sky News cameraman assaulting a man who had been arrested. The information ministry shared the police statement. @InfoMinZW said, "Constable Makumire who was on suspension during an assault on a civilian which was captured in the @SkyNews has been arrested just as promised by HE @edmnangagwa." Police say that Mukamire was not on official duty when the incident happened because he was serving a suspension. "The security services have always been emphasising that bogus and rogue elements are responsible for acts of lawlessness, which are tarnishing good standing of the security forces," the statement said. President Emmerson Mnangagwa had said that he was "appalled" when he saw the footage of the officers beating the civilian. Meanwhile, the High Court has ordered the release on bail of the activist and pastor Evan Mawarire who is accused of subverting the government. He was arrested on 16 January amid protests against soaring fuel prices. He was later charged with inciting violence, but he denied any wrongdoing. The pastor gained fame as a figurehead of the #ThisFlag protestsÂ against the former president, Robert Mugabe, in 2016. He was cleared in 2017 on charges of attempting a violent overthrow of the government. Earlier on Tuesday, hundreds of lawyers marched through the streets of the capital, Harare, to demand justice for the more than 1,000 people who have been arrested during a security crackdown following recent protests. Those charged have been denied bail and human rights lawyers accuse the government of instructing the judiciary. Click here for the latest political news
