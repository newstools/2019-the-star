Staff at the troubled National Land Commission have taken on their vice chair Abigael Mbagaya, accusing her of threatening and victimising them. They said Mbagaya has launched arbitrary administrative action against them. Staff who spoke to the Star on condition of anonymity complained of threats and witch-hunt. Godfrey Musaina through Duncan Okubasu advocates has petitioned the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to take action against the vice chair as well as rescind all administrative actions she has taken in the last four months. Mbagaya sparked controversy late last year when she started issuing show cause letters to staff. She also wrote memos varying employment terms of staff, in a move seen as usurping the secretariat’s powers. The commission’s administrative and executive powers are vested in the chair and the CEO of the commissions whereas commissioners are in charge of policy and act as the appellate arm on any human resource issues. On December 19, 2018, Mbagaya wrote to Paddy Makene, an officer at the commission, asking why he should not be sacked for what she said was gross negligence of duty and insubordination. Makene and three others had travelled to the US on a research trip, but according to the show cause letter he had not been cleared. “In the view of above your dismissal from service on account of gross negligence of duty and refusal to comply with lawful instruction without any cause is contemplated,” Mbagaya said in the letter. In a response dated December 31, 2018, Makene said the trip was cleared by his supervisor, the commission and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Click here for the latest political news
