A student who sat the KCPE exam last year is seeking help to enrol in Form 1. She lacks school fees. Dorcas Kasenchui scored 360 marks from Kasina Primary School, Mwingi Central subcounty. She was one of four candidates who scored 350 marks and above. Kasenchui was to join Chogoria Girls’ High School. “I worked very hard despite the biting poverty in my home and harsh learning environment. I have always wanted to become a doctor since I think that’s where I can touch lives directly,” she said. Her mother Ruth Kithumbi, a mother of five, appealed to well-wishers to help take her to secondary school. “She was to report to Chogoria Girls between January 7 and 9, but she is still at home with no hope.”
