President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged tourism stakeholders to be creative and improve the quality and range of services to compete globally. He said major tourism marketing campaigns are useless if the sector does not offer high-quality services. “We are operating in a global market and we must invest in improving services in our hotels and national parks. Today’s tourists have many options and we have to ensure we work hard to attract and retain them,” President Kenyatta said. He spoke at State House, Mombasa, on Monday, when he received a report highlighting Kenya’s achievements in the tourism sector in 2018. The Tourism Sector Performance Report 2018 presented to the Head of State by CS Najib Balala shows the country earned Sh157 billion last year, up from Sh119 billion in 2017 reflecting a 31.26 per cent growth. It also indicates that international visitor arrivals increased from 1.47 million in 2017 to 2.02 million in 2018, representing a 37.33 per cent growth. The report also shows that domestic tourism bed occupancy increased from 3.64 million in 2017 to 3.97 million in 2018, depicting a 9.03 per cent increase. Uhuru commended the Ministry of Tourism and stakeholders in the sector for the remarkable growth. He said the sector should ensure local host communities benefit from tourism. “For example, we need to involve the locals and ensure that young people get employment by creating openings for them in areas like selling curios and other small businesses,” Uhuru said. He urged the stakeholders to partner with the government to boost the sector by improving security. “So long as you make the local people part of the sector, you will be helping to improve security and benefiting the locals,” the President said. The report cites political stability, improved security and growth in the aviation sector as some of the drivers for the growth witnessed last year. Other factors included withdrawal of travel advisories by the US and the UK governments, high profile foreign visits including those by Heads of State and their spouses and the adoption of the open border policy for Africans that provides for the issuance of tourist visas on arrival.
