Former Nairobi Education executive Janet Ouko has given Governor Mike Sonko seven days to apologise over an alleged defamatory statement he made against her or he faces court action. Ouko, through her lawyer Dan Ameyo, wrote to the Governor on Wednesday evening demanding an apology. "Take notice that unless we receive the written apology within the next seven days from the date hereof, our instructions are to file suit against you without further reference to you and at your own risk as to costs and consequences arising therefrom," she said. Ouko, who was one of Sonko's most trusted executives, unceremoniously resigned on January 7, over what she termed as the governor's lack of respect for county employees. In the notice to the Governor, Ameyo said Sonko injured the reputation of his client after he claimed that she oversaw the loss of Sh357 million in her docket. "As the head of the docket, the county government lost Sh357 million for which she is to be held to account. We wrote cheques to schools but the same cheques were secretly brought back, cancelled and fresh ones written to their cronies names,‚Äù Sonko is quoted to have said. Sonko allegedly uttered the remarks while addressing a press conference in Kilifi on January 9. The advocate said that the statement caused anguish, mental torture and psychologically affected his client. "It has betrayed our client as corrupt, a thief and a person who is unworthy to hold any public office in the country and anywhere in the world," reads the notice. He said the utterances has affected his client's reputation and standing in the society and placed her to ridicule before the society. "Arising from your statement, our client is being shunned by her friends, family and public. Our client has, therefore, suffered loss and damage for which we hold you and your office personally liable," said the lawyer in the notice. Click here for the latest political news
