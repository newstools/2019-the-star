Gospel singer Daddy Owen has dismissed claims that gospel artistes are doing bad music. "I want people to come out clearly and tell us which gospel artiste they are listening to because as far as I am concerned, the industry has got good music," Owen told Word Is yesterday. Earlier on, he posted on social media that people should stop tarnishing the whole industry. "I am tired of this vybe ati, 'Gospel is dead'. Dead? Who killed it? Gospel will never die," Owen wrote. The industry has been built for a long time, and let us not destroy it because of some few artistes. "It just depends on who you are listening to or looking at because if it's about music, I know so many musicians who are releasing real gospel music year in year out! If it's content, the music is rich! My list of gospel music and artistes I listen to is always full and with great anointing," he said. He encouraged fans not to be carried away by "a few characters" they think are not doing credible gospel music. "Those few characters should not define the whole gospel industry. We have even upcoming gospel artistes who are writing real gospel music, but fans don't want to listen and support them. They want to listen to those who are bringing drama now and then," he said.
