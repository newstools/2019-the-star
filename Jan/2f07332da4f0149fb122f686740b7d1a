A group of farmers have started a fish hatchery in Kangaita in Tetu subcounty, Nyeri county. The Sh1.5 million facility was started with funding from International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) and contributions from members. The facility has already started fingerlings production and is expected to produce 30,000- 50,000 fingerlings monthly and serve farmers from the county and its environs. The setting up of the hatchery is a relief to farmers who earlier travelled to Sagana, Mwea in Kirinyaga, Nairobi and Thika in Kiambu county to buy fingerlings. The chairman of Together Forever, a community-based organisation that built the facility, Charles Mbauni, said yesterday that farmers will reduce their fish production costs.
