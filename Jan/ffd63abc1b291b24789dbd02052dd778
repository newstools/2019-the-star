Bungoma leaders have threatened to lead cane farmers in demonstrations against the government's delay to pay their arrears. Governor Wycliffe Wangamati, Senator Moses Wetang’ula, Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi and his Kimilili counterpart Didmus Barasa faulted President Uhuru Kenyatta for giving farmers empty promises regarding their payments. The leaders spoke on Saturday at Ndengelwa area in Kanduyi constituency during the funeral of Joshua Wanyonyi. Wanyonyi a bodaboda rider was shot dead by armed thugs last week in Bungoma town. While addressing residents last year in Bukhungu Stadium during Mashujaa day, Uhuru said cane farmers will have been paid before Christmas day.
