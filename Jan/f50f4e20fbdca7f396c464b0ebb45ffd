Athletics Kenya President Jack Tuwei has described the two-day long inspection tour by a delegation from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) as an eye opener in their planning for next year’s World Under 20 Championships. The delegation had their final assessment of the country’s readiness in hosting the event slated for July 7-12 at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani and expressed contentment with the progress. Tuwei noted that the inspection necessitated a change in their planning and budget allocations since the event is bigger than the 2017 World Under 18 Championships held at the same venue. The AK boss said his office will work closely with the Ministry of Sports and all stakeholders through concerted efforts and consultations to stage a successful event. “The inspection tour has effected changes in our planning and budget since the event is bigger than the U-18. Work has already started and we are looking forward to host a successful event. The Organising Committee is set to be constituted next month for adequate preparations for the championships which are set to attract more participants, events, media and officials,” said Tuwei. From the visit we know what to adjust and what to renovate. We wish to assure all that the country is safe and ready to host the event.” Tuwei’s sentiments on the safety of the participants were echoed by the Executive Director of Communication at IAAF Jackie Brock-Doyle who lauded the response by the security apparatus. She said “It’s sad since such incidents happen worldwide. Even the 2012 Olympics in London suffered security threats but it was successful. We applause the response by the Kenyan security forces who ensured there were minimal casualties. There should be no cause for alarm,” said Jackie. “The U-18 event was snubbed on security grounds but a number of countries wanted to focus more on the Youth Games and other events.”
