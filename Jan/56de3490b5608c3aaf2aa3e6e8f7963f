Migori Woman Representative Pamela Odhiambo has promised to train boda boda after surviving a fatal accident in which her bodyguard was killed. The bodyguard Fred Owich perished in the Sunday morning crash on October 28, 2018. "I lost a precious person," Odhiambo said, adding that she will stand with his young family. The first time lawmaker was heading to Homa Bay to join Baringo senator Gideon Moi at an event when the accident occurred. Witnesses said Odhiambo's car veered off the road and rolled several times while avoiding to hit a motorcyclist.

"We are rolling out proper training for motorcyclists. If we only let riders wear uniforms and safety gear, then we will continue losing lives," she told journalists in Nairobi. Odhiambo said her office has already engaged the National Transport and Safety Authority to help in the training of Migori motorcyclists. "In our case, the motorcyclist suddenly made a u-turn in front of us," she said. The legislator said she is recovering well and thanked Kenyans for standing with her.
