The Nairobi government on Tuesday began holding a public participation forum for the urban renewal project at City Hall. Residents are expected to give their views on the much-awaited affordable housing project. Nairobi Lands and Housing executive Charles Kerich told the Star on the phone on Tuesday a sessional paper which is the policy that would guide the project was tabled in the assembly last month MCAs held a special sitting to adopt the supplementary estimates. Kerich said the committee for planning held a retreat early this month to go through the sessional paper. “The views of the public will be considered as the committee finalises the document so it can be tabled for debate when the assembly resumes next month,” Kerich said.

Kerich said subject to the approval of the sessional paper, the groundbreaking for three out of the seven estates will be done next month. These are Pangani, Ngong Road and Jevanjee. Phase one of the pilot project will cost Sh300 billion. Last month, City Hall said it is ready to compensate Pangani residents whose houses will be upgraded in a two-year plan. They will be compensated for the duration that the project will take. The county had planned to break ground before the end of 2018, but the launch was postponed for logistical reasons. Among the reasons for the delay were consultations with residents and the location of the houses. “We have tried to be gentle with the tenants. We do not want the project to be controversial. As you know, there are people in Nairobi who will not hesitate to turn a noble project into a scandal that does not exist,” Kerich said in a past interview. Click here for the latest political news
