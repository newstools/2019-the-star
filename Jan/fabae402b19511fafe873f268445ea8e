Central Bank of Kenya governor Patrick Njoroge has dismissed claims that it has restricted the issuance of new coins. Njoroge was responding to an article by a local daily which wrote that the bank had directed bankers to cap the issuance of new coins to Sh100 per customer amid a hitch over public awareness. But the governor through his Twitter account on Tuesday said the claims were false. "Absolutely not true. There are no limits on the amount of coins distributed," he said. According to the daily, a circular to chief executives of commercial banks and microfinance banks noted that more public awareness on the new coins was needed. In December, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Njoroge unveiled the new generation coins that began circulating in 2018.
