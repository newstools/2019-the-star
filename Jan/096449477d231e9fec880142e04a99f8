Nairobi MCAs have told Governor Ferdinand Waititu to keep off the city's affairs and focus on his county. Led by Waithaka MCA Anthony Kiragu, the representatives condemned Waititu’s remarks on 14-seater matatus. “We are shocked at the ignorance of the governor from Kiambu. We wish to remind you that the law barring 14-seater matatus was passed in the year 2010 while he was the MP for Embakasi. This has nothing to do with the current governor," Kiragu said at City Hall on Tuesday. Waititu last Wednesday accused Governor Mike Sonko of mismanaging the public transport system. “Such decisions are detrimental to the sector and hurt masses who use matatus daily. Someone tell Sonko you cannot run such a county by waking up in the morning and issuing arbitrary and insensitive orders," Waititu said. Kiragu said Waititu has become a stumbling block in the quest for a good transport system. “We are aware he thrives in chaos and madness,” Kiragu said. Roysambu MCA Peter Warutere said, “Nairobi is not an extension of Kiambu. If the kitchen is too hot for him, allow him to penetrate his attention elsewhere but not in Nairobi." The MCAs pledged their support and confidence in Sonko’s leadership. Click here for the latest political news
