University students on Tuesday held peaceful demonstrations over increased cases of extrajudicial killings of their own by the police. Under the umbrella of Kenya Universities Students Organisation (Kuso) led by the union chairman Anthony Manyara, they said six students were killed by police last year alone. The latest case was that of Carilton Maina, the Leeds University student who was gunned down by police in Kibera on December 21 last year while returning home from watching a football match. "There are accumulated cases of students shot by police officers. We no longer have faith in our courts and investigating agencies because they are taking too long to deliver justice," Manyara said.

"We also want awards to be introduced for officers who perform exemplary every month," the chairman said. The varsity students also want all victims of police brutality and extrajudicial killings to be compensated and the police service be compelled to make a public apology and cater for hospital and burial expenses incurred. They put on notice all police officers saying they should never enter any university premises in the country. They warned those who conduct arbitrary arrests to stop the actions. The demo procession started at the University of Nairobi main gate through Koinange Street, Kenyatta Avenue, Uhuru Highway and ended at the Parliament Buildings. Ipoa in late December said it will recommend criminal or disciplinary proceedings against any officers proven to have shot the university student.
