The Court of Appeal reinstated Kangogo as Marakwet East MP, saying he was rightfully elected. Kangogo's election was nullified by the High Court after voter Sammy Kemboi said the August 8, 2017 vote was not transparent. The judges also dismissed findings by High Court judge Kanyi Kimondo that two unregistered polling stations were used on voting day.
