ODM leader Raila Odinga (left), ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi and Bungoma senator Moses Wetang’ula are today expected to share a platform at a burial in Kakamega. The three Nasa principals will be at the burial of Joan Chiri in Manyonyi village. Chiri is the daughter of Lugari MP Ayub Savula. Also expected are Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa and Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya. Controversial Jubilee party vice-chairman David Murathe will also attend with hot political debate expected. Murathe has asked Deputy President William Ruto to retire in 2022. Succession politics and referendum calls are expected to dominate speeches during the burial. Chiri died last week at the Nairobi Hospital after a short illness.
