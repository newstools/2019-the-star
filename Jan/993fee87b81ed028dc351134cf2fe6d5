Former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga has called for intensified war on cybercrime after a Facebook user claimed he was dead. An account identified as Zecky Zecky Owish on Friday posted ‘breaking news’ of Magwanga’s ‘death.’ Magwanga yesterday condemned the post, saying he was alive. Speaking to Star over the matter, the former lawmaker asked Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i and his ICT counterpart Joe Mucheru to intensify the war on cybercrime to curb defamation. Magwanga said he would want to know those behind the Facebook post. “I’m urging the government to track this person and others who taint people’s reputations on social media so that legal action can be taken against them,” Magwanga said. He said censoring and proper surveillance of social media platforms by the government will boost the fight against terrorism. “It is imperative for the state to closely monitor information posted on social media because terrorists also use these platforms,” the former lawmaker said. Magwanga linked the post to his political rivals. He vied for the Homa Bay gubernatorial seat in 2017 and has since challenged the election of Governor Cyprian Awiti. The High Court nullified Awiti’s election and the Court of Appeal upheld the nullification. The petition is pending before the Supreme Court. Magwanga said he was unmoved by such propaganda, saying it was an archaic way of doing politics. “I think this person was sent by my political opponents, but his propaganda will not intimidate me,” Magwanga said.
