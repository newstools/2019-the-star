Gospel artiste Papa Dennis has reminisced his life after his mother died. "Our mum left us at a very young age with my twin brother. We were desperate and there was nobody to take care of us," Papa Dennis told Radio Jambo on Friday. After class 8, Papa says he dropped out of school and became a hawker to educate his siblings. "The church rented a house for us, but before, we would sleep outside, until one time when I was hired by a businessperson," he said. All his hustle was lost, however, during the 2007 post-election violence in Kisumu, where he was living. "I lost everything in 2007. I came back home and became homeless again. I started singing in church and even in my hawking. That is how I attracted customers," he said. "I recorded my first video in South Africa, 'Makekes' with Jimmy Gait, and that was my breakthrough song." Papa Dennis has won several awards, the latest one being Best Gospel Artiste of the Year in the 2018 African Muzik Magazine Awards (Afrimma).
