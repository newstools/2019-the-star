The late Conrad Karukenya, alias Tiger Power, will be buried tomorrow at his home in Makengi village, Embu North. This comes after the family and the Embu government agreed on a common date to give Power a decent burial. The family had earlier called on the national and county government to assist them in burial preparations and final send-off. Tiger's son, Boniface Njeru, said their father had no other source of income apart from pulling jaw-dropping stunts at public functions. "He had stopped performing due to his deteriorating state of health," Njeru said. He died at Consolata Mission Hospital, Kyeni, early this month due to a heart problem.
