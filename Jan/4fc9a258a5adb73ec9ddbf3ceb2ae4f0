An Administration Police officer is recovering at Baringo Referral Hospital after allegedly stabbing himself on the chest in unclear circumstances on Friday evening. A colleague said Patrick Wekesa, who is attached to Kaptimbor AP camp, locked himself inside his room and attempted to take his own life. His colleagues rescued him during the 4pm incident. "He was screaming in pain and blood was oozing from the wound on his chest. We rushed to the room and took him to the hospital," his colleague said. Wekesa mans the gate of Baringo governor Stanley Kiptis' residence in Kabarnet town. County AP Commander Robinson Ndiwa disputed claims that Wekesa wanted to kill himself because he had been transferred. "The officer was drunk. His colleagues who were on duty allowed him to take time off to go and relax before he stabbed himself," he said. Cases of security officers taking their own lives in Baringo have been on the rise. In March last year, AP officer Daniel Chemjor, 50, from Kapsoo in Baringo Central shot himself dead at Marigat camp. "He had just returned from his one-month leave when he shot himself using his G3 gun," a colleague said. On September 18 last year, another AP officer Robert Ewoi, 40, attached to the same camp, sneaked away from duty at midnight and went to his house in Kampi ya Samaki and killed himself. He injured his wife Purity Elim, 20, before killing himself. It is reported the 40-year-old officer was drunk. On June 2017 Rapid Deployment Unit officer Jackson Mwangi turned rowdy and shot two colleagues dead. Gabriel Kungâ€™u Njoroge and Francis Ekono were killed and Daniel Kyalo was injured at Kasiela camp in Baringo South. Click here for the latest political news
