ODM leader Raila Odinga is well and has not fallen ill while on a trip in Tanzania, his spokesman Dennis Onyango has said. In a statement on Sunday, Onyango said photos in which the opposition leader is seen being held by security officers at a stadium in Dar es Salaam are not indicative of ill health. "Hon Raila Odinga is fine in Dar. Images of security people holding him emerged from a step on the podium that was falling off and not anything to do with health. Thanks though to everyone who has expressed concern," Onyango said. Raila is in Tanzania where he was the chief guest during the SportPesa Cup final between Kariobangi Sharks and Bandari FC. The trip up happened after he presented the trophy to the winning team at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam. Sharks were crowned champions courtesy of Harisson Mwendwa's lone goal in the 60th minute. They will pocket Sh3 million and host EPL side Everton later this year.
