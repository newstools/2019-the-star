A gold miner has died of suspected carbon monoxide poisoning. Two others barely survived. The three were pumping water out of a mine in Bukira, Kuria West, Migori, on Monday evening. “They had drained the water from the mine. Those outside noticed something was amiss when they couldn’t bring ores to the surface,” their colleague Charles Mwita said. January and February are peak months for mining. The accident, the first reported this year, shocked the Migori gold belt. Rescuers pulled the three to the surface but realised that one had died as they administered first aid.  Carbon monoxide is an odourless gas. The body is at Migori County Referral Hospital mortuary, awaiting postmortem examination.
