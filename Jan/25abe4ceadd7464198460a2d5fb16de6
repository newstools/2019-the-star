Mandera Roads executive Zulekha Hulbale has flagged off construction of the 20-kilometre Rhamu Dimtu-Ardha Garbicha Road to gravel standards. She said poor infrastructure throughout the Northeast has held back the region’s development and caused suffering, especially during rainy seasons. Hulbale said when the road is complete, residents will move with ease and do business without the worry of getting stuck on the road for days. “Improving rural access will improve access to economic opportunities, health and education,” she said. The CEC said governor Ali Roba aims to promote low-cost and sustainable road infrastructure for rural access. The majority of the population relies on roads to transport agricultural produce and livestock for their livelihood. Unlike many parts of the country that have witnessed tremendous growth in tarmacked roads, many Northeastern Kenya roads start and end in Garissa county. In recent years, however, the tarmacking of major roads in the region has given residents hope that they will soon catch up with the rest of the country in infrastructure. Urban roads in Mandera and Wajir towns have also been tarmaked. The national government has embarked on phased tarmacking of major roads in the region to connect the major towns of Garissa, Wajir and Mandera. Deputy President William Ruto last year launched construction of Dekaburi, Garissa Ndogo – Sankuri link road in Garissa. In the 2018-19 financial year, Garissa allocated Sh4.3 billion to roads projects, out of Sh10.15 billion for development. The projects are good news to passengers and motorists who have grappled with travel nightmare during the rainy seasons. Some spend more than two weeks from Garissa to Mandera town. Last year, the Hulugho-Garissa road and those linking the constituency to Malindi and Lamu were repaired after they were washed away by floods. Ijara MP Sophia Abdi Noor launched the projects. She said a better road network would create jobs for its “many idle youths”.
