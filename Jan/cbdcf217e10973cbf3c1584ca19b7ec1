Detectives have been deployed to Ruai and Utawala in search of a pistol stolen from a senior police officer last week. Heads of the Flying Squad and Special Crimes Prevention Unit met on Tuesday at the Nairobi area DCI headquarters to, among other things, plan the search mission. Peter Kirimi, a senior superintendent of police in charge of intelligence in Nairobi, was robbed of his firearm, which had 15 bullets, last Saturday. Police suspect the top cop may have been drugged. It, however, remains unclear how he was drugged as in his statement, Kirimi said he sat alone at a hotel in Utawala where he had drinks and food. Reports from Kayole police station sent to the police headquarters, stated that Kirimi was driving to his home after leaving the hotel in Utawala estate when he started feeling dizzy. He told police that he parked his vehicle by the roadside shortly after midnight and only woke up the following day to find his firearm stolen. He was also robbed of two mobile phones. Police in Kayole have opened investigations but are yet to find any witness to corroborate the claims by the top cop. Depending on the outcome of the investigations, the senior officer could end up being prosecuted. If prosecuted, he risks a five-year jail term or a fine of not more than Sh500,000. The National Police Service Act nots:”An officer who sells, loses by neglect, makes away with or wilfully, or negligently damages any firearm, ammunition commits an offence and is liable to a jail term not exceeding five years or a fine not exceeding Sh500,000”.
