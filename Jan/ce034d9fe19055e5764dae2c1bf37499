CBK governor Patrick Njoroge took to the streets in Nairobi on Saturday as he sought to find out how micro and small business owners were fairing.

From January 1, micro and small business owners with a turnover of Sh5 million or less per year have to pay a presumptive tax of 15 per cent of the cost of their trading licences when seeking renewals. The tax was introduced in a bid to net in more business owners, especially those in the informal sector who may evade tax.
