A 27-year-old man from Emia village, Bungoma county, set his house on fire with his three children inside after his wife left him and returned to her parents' home. Two of Caleb Juma's children aged three and five were burnt beyond recognition, while the third, 6, succumbed to injuries after being taken to Kopsiro Health Centre. Chepkukur assistant chief Doreen Kipyego said Juma was drunk and had quarreled with his wife before she returned to her parents' home. "We are real yet to know what prompted Caleb Juma to set his house ablaze, but we know that he had recently had a domestic squabble with his wife who had left him with the children," she said. Juma fled, but was later arrested. Bungoma county commander Francis Sang urged couples to find amicable ways to deal with disputes. Click here for the latest political news
