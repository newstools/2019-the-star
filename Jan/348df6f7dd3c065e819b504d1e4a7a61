A few days after the Nyamira county government received a Sh40 million consignment of drugs, residents are outraged by lack of medications in health facilities. Many of them have been forced to seek help from private facilities. “We saw vehicles carrying consignments of drugs a few days ago. We were assured that we will never lack drugs in our health facilities, but are now missing the drugs in our facilities,” one of the residents said. Health executive Douglas Bosire dismissed the claims. He said the facilities have medicines and only some health centres are yet to get theirs. He said those without will get theirs in the course of the week. “We brought drugs to the county and we are going to ensure the health facilities are fully loaded with drugs to help residents. Ignore talk doing the rounds that there are no drugs in our facilities. You can go to any subcounty health facility and confirm by yourself,’’ he said by phone. Reached for clarification, the managements of the subcounty hospitals did not return calls or reply to text messages. Patients who visited the facilities insisted, however, that they were referred to private chemists to buy prescription medications - even painkillers. The Health department has been facing many problems despite getting the lion’s share of the county budget. The residents appealed to the county administration to adequately stock the facilities.
