The attack on the DusitD2 hotel complex ended yesterday morning after approximately 18 hours. Over 20 people died and many more were seriously injured. Five attackers and one suicide bomber also died. This was a terrible tragedy and all our sympathy goes out to the wounded and bereaved. However, we should recognise that the security services did an outstanding job to successfully resolve the incident. Remember, the Westgate attack in September 2013 lasted three days and was tainted by allegations of looting and inter-service rivalry between police and the army. On Tuesday the security services arrived at 14 Riverside Drive within 30 minutes. The Recce Squad then started the long difficult job of isolating the attackers in the building and neutralising them. Obviously the government is now better prepared for a terrorist attack in Nairobi than during the Westgate fiasco. In particular, there was a clear command structure at Riverside. The GSU and Recce Squad took the lead, although KDF and foreign agencies also provided support. That coordination must continue. United we stand, divided we fall.
