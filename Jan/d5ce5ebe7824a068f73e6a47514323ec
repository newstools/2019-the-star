A senior officer at the Kilifi government on Thursday evening collapsed inside a toilet in his office and died. James Angore, 64, died at 8pm. Until his death, Angore was the county director for Early Childhood Development Education. Kilifi Education executive Gabriel Katana on Friday said Angore reported to duty in apparently good health. “He spent the day in his office until 7.45pm. I was in my office too to finish up some work. He had some work that he was to finish before going home” he said. Katana said when he was walking out of my office, a staffer was calling for help to get the director out of the toilet. He said they helped Angore out of the toilet but he could stand and he had breathing difficulties. “After putting him in the elevator, he asked for his briefcase and laptop and we assured him he would get them once he gets well,” Katana said. They took him to Aga Khan Hospital in Kilifi, but the facility closed as it only operates during the day. He was taken to Mwananchi Nursing and Maternity home, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Katana said Angore complained of leg pains. “He saw a doctor a week ago and the medicine caused breathing problems. He went to the doctor again and got different drugs,” he said. His young brother, Peter Angore, said he had no history of high blood pressure or diabetes. He said his brother developed complications after being treated for the pain in his legs.
