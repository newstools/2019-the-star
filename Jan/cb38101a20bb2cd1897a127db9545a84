Equity Bank has said it has complied with orders that prohibited Former PS Lillian Omollo from withdrawing funds held in their accounts. In an affidavit, advocate Kariuki King’ori says they are ready and willing to abide by any orders granted by the court in relation to Lillian Wanja Muthoni T/A Sahara Consultation, Lidi Holdings Limited and Lidi Estate Limited accounts held with them. “I confirm that the bank is aware of the orders issued in October last year and touching on various accounts held by Lillian Wanja Muthoni T/A Sahara Consultation, Lidi Holdings Limited and Lidi Estate Limited and which orders have been fully complied with,” read the affidavit. Last year, Anti-corruption High Court judge issued orders barring Omollo from transacting, withdrawing and transferring funds held in six accounts in Equity Bank and four others in Diamond Trust Bank. Omollo’s accounts were frozen on suspicion they were used as conduits for millions looted from the National Youth Service. Justice Hedwig Ong’udi froze the accounts for 90 days under the money laundering law following an application by the Asset Recovery Agency. “That the preservation orders shall remain in force for 90 days as provided for under Section 84 of Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act,” the court order reads. The case will be heard on February 4.
