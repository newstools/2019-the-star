A travel agent was on Thursday charged before a Kibera court with obtaining money from a Nairobi businessman by false pretences. Gordian Mwaluma was accused that with intent to defraud obtained Sh663,800 from the complainant pretending to offer accommodation, air transfers and tours within Mombasa county, a fact he knew to be false. He allegedly committed the offence between October 1 and November 30 last year at Lavington area in Nairobi. According to the prosecution report, the accused who is a travel agent was contacted by the complainant to make reservations for him and his family at white sands resort in Mombasa. He was to book the hotel for five days from December 27 to January 1, 2019. The complainant told police that Mwaluma was paid the amount of money for the cost of his vacation to his bank account in the name of Realmark travel agency and he received a receipt. He said before travelling, Mwaluma called him asking him to move to another Pride inn hotel because he had done an upgrade for him for free. On December 27, the complainant told police he travelled and checked in at the hotel and after the five days he was shocked when the management refused to check him out. They claimed he had to pay Sh540,000 total cost of his stay. He tried to call the accused who told him that he had no money to give him. He later paid the amount owed and reported the matter to the police and after investigations, the accused was arrested. Mwaluma denied the charges before senior resident magistrate Jane Kamau and was released on a cash bail of Sh200,000 or a bond of Sh300,000 with a surety of similar amount. Lawyer Eddy Orinda was in court watching brief for the complainant. Mwaluma's case will be heard on March 5, 2019. Click here for the latest political news
