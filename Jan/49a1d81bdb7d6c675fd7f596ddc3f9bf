Over 3,000 residents of Mkokoni and Kizingitini in Lamu East risk having their houses swept by the Indian Ocean after the collapse of sea walls. The sea walls were built to stop water from the ocean from entering public areas. The collapse has been attributed to lack of maintenance. Affected residents blamed Lamu county government for the poor structural manner in which the walls were constructed. They want the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate allegations of misappropriation of funds during their construction . Khaldun Vae, a renowned elder from Lamu said: “The fact that we are now living without sea walls is just a disaster. It’s surprising that the Mkokoni wall was built just two years ago yet it has already collapsed, that obviously means someone did a shoddy job that puts us at risk.” A section of the sea wall in Kizingitini was abandoned midway four years ago. Other sections have since collapsed. Many houses close to the ocean shores are already filled with water forcing residents to either migrate or put up with the situation. “Sea walls require serious plans so that they can last long,” resident Shee Kassim said. Residents want the national government ensure long lasting walls are built. They also want jetties put up in the areas to ease water transport.
