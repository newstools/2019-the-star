Busia is yet to implement some development projects because the national government owes it Sh4 billion, Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has said. He said the county has huge pending bills and urged the Treasury to release the money so residents can benefit. The county chief spoke on Saturday in Okilidu, Teso South, during the burial of his nephew Collins Ojaamong. “We are being blamed from every corner for failing to complete some projects that we started. How do you expect governors to execute their mandates if funds meant for projects are withheld by the national government?” he asked. Ojaamong appealed to residents to be patient. The county will strive to fulfil development in line with the County Integrated Development Plan 2018-22. “Ignore propaganda being spewed around to derail our development plans,” he told mourners. Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi said they have rolled out many ‘transformative’ projects this year. “We’ll work diligently under the guidance of the governor. The county recruited nurses and doctors recently. Plans to recruit security officers are advanced,” he said.
