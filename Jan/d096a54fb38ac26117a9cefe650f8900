A 61-year-old woman who killed her son for sleeping on her bed will serve a three-year probation, the High Court in Eldoret ruled yesterday. Justice Olga Sewe handed Sally Samoei the non-custodial sentence after she confessed to killing her 36-year-old son on the night of March 19, 2014 at Karandile village in Eldoret East, Uasin Gishu. The mother of five had told the court that she unintentionally killed the son with a blunt object when she found him asleep on her bed. He was drunk. She recalled that the son had arrived home at 9pm from a drinking spree and demanded food. She told him to waitbut “my son became impatient and threatened to beat me, forcing me to run for my life. When I came back the following morning, I found him sleeping on my bed. I tried to wake him up in vain.” She then picked up a blunt object and hit him three times on the head but he still he did not wake up. She went out but when she came back the son was dead. She reported the death to Moiben Police Station, but she was locked up and later charged in court with the offense. In mitigation, Sally said she has five children and seven grand children who depend on her. “It was not the first time he (deceased) had threatened her life,” she told the court. Sewe ruled: ” Having perused and considered the probation officer’s report dated January 21, it is hereby ordered that the accused person be placed on probation for three years.”
