The Ministry of Education has made radical changes in co-curricular activities calendar for the 2019 season. According to a circular signed by P.S Khaemba on behalf of the Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang released on Monday, the changes were done during a stakeholders retreat held at Machakos University in October last year. The new changes come into operation at a time when the ministry has introduced a competence-based curriculum. According to the circular, decathlon and heptathlon have been expunged from the secondary schools’ calendar. Rugby 15’s and 7’s will this time round be held in Term One—a move that has been opposed by many stakeholders. Rugby 7’s was previously played in second term. According to the latest changes, rugby 15’s team will comprise 20 players while 7’s team will feature 11 players. Cross country has also been moved to Term One alongside track and field events. In the primary schools section, kids athletics, gymnastics and netball for boys have been expunged from the calendar.
