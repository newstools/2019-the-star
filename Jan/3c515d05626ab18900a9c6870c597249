Former Youth Enterprise Development Fund Chairman Bruce Odhiambo is dead. Odhiambo died on Tuesday morning at the Nairobi Hospital Intensive Care Unit after a long battle with cardiac ailments. In 2018 October, Odhiambo went to India to replace his pacemaker that had been implanted under the skin to help manage irregular heartbeats. He returned to Kenya in November but his body developed more complications that led to his admission to hospital. Odhiambo resigned from the Youth Fund in March 2016 after being accused of allegedly misappropriating Sh180 million at the kitty. He was facing charges alongside the former Youth Fund CEO Catherine Namuye. During their trial in June 2017 they lodged fresh protests over documents that were allegedly not supplied to the court to support their case. Their lawyers said certain documents that may boost their defence had not been supplied to them. They both denied charges and were granted a million bond with surety of a similar amount or an alternative cash bail of Sh2 million. Namuye was later found dead in her Kileleshwa home on October 4 after collapsing. Neighbours said they heard screams and when they rushed to check they found her on the floor foaming at the mouth.
