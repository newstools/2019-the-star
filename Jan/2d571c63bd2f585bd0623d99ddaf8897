Mathare United showed they have the mettle to last the distance in this year’s Kenyan Premier League title race as they rendered an own goal from Johnston Omurwa a mere blot to romp to a 3-1 come-from-behind win over Vihiga United. After Omurwa had inadvertently sliced the ball past his own keeper, Kevin Kimani brought them back into the game just before the break. Fortune would favour the Slum Boys five minutes after the break as Maurice Juma also hit an own goal to put them in front. Cliff Nyakeya put the result beyond doubt an hour into the match to push Francis Kimanzi’s men five points clear at the top of the table. After a slow start to the season that led to changes in the club’s technical bench with club legend John Baraza being handed the coaching reins on a permanent basis, Sofapakas campaign continued to gather steam as they crushed Zoo Kericho 3-2 in Machakos. A 10-minute three-goal blitz midway through the first half accounted for Zoo’s scalp. Piston Mutamba opened the scoring in the 23rd minute before further goals by Elly Asieche and Umar Kasumba killed the game off as a contest with just over half an hour played. Though Damson Chitambe would reduce the deficit from the spot in the 60th minute and Bernard Odhiambo added another in stoppage time, their goose had already been cooked. Posta Rangers’ woes showed no signs of abating as they fell to their seventh loss of the campaign after succumbing to a David Otieno goal that gave Sony Sugar crucial three points in Awendo. Bottom-of-the-table Mount Kenya United’s wait for a first win continues after they were beaten 2-1 by Nzoia Sugar. Collins Wakhungu’s double either side of Frank Balla’s strike consigned Mellis Medos’ charges to a 10-match winless streak. Ulinzi Stars and Kakamega Homeboyz played out a goalless draw.
