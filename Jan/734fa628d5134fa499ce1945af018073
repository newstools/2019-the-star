Parliament will support a bill prohibiting state officers from doing business with the government to prevent conflict of interest. National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale said the National Assembly is fully behind President’s Uhuru’s campaign against graft. Speaking in Garissa on Monday, Duale said the law should be in place by February 12 when the House reconvenes after recess. “We will put that law in place so you either work for the state, county, Judiciary or Parliament — or you do business and stay at home,” Duale said. President Kenyatta last week said the law will prohibit any action by any state or public officer that creates a conflict of interest. He directed the Attorney General to draft a bill restraining all public servants from privately engaging in activities that are in conflict with or benefit to their offices. Kenya Livestock Marketing Council vice chair Dubay Amey said the new law will be “a game changer in the war against corruption”. Speaking to the Star, he said, “We all know of police officers owning a fleet of matatus operating on our routes. Such vehicles are always untouchable because their owners are the police bosses and traffic commanders. These are some of the things that need to be brought to an end,” Amey said. He urged all state officers not to frustrate the President. “The President has Kenyans’ support and anybody who tries to frustrate him will meet the wrath of the people,”he said
