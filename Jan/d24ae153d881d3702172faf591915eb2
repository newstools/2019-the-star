A distraught man in Migori shocked residents when he bought his own coffin and lay inside begging for death over a 'stressful wife'. Awilo JaSiaya, who hails from Siaya, on Thursday approached a carpenter and inquired about the price of a coffin. “He was wearing a boda boda rider's reflector jacket. We thought he was coming to buy a coffin for a burial somewhere else,” carpenter Alphonse Odhiambo said. Odhiambo said the man paid Sh13,000 for the coffin. “When we asked him who was going to be buried, he said himself. He then jumped inside the coffin and lay down,” Odhiambo said. JaSiaya then paid a motorbike rider to take him home while inside the casket. He was wearing a campaign reflector jacket with Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga's portrait. “Despite having very powerful relatives, my wife has been disturbing me, I'm fed up. So I planned this funeral because I am like a walking corpse,” JaSiaya told the press. He said he married his wife in 2000 and together they have three children. Their eldest daughter is  in Form Two. But neighbours who spoke to the press said the man has been problematic adding that he was chased away from his home because of his behaviour. Neighbours said the man has been beating up his wife in public. “He once walked into Migori Referral Hospital morgue and told morticians that he had a body which needs to be preserved. He was restrained as he tried to get into a freezer,” a neighbour said. Click here for the latest political news
