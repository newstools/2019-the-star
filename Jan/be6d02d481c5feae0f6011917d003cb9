Arsenal will on Tuesday honour slain student Carilton Maina during their English Premier League match against Cardiff at the Emirates Stadium in London. The former University of Leeds engineering student was an ardent Arsenal supporter. He adored Arsenal and attended home and away matches. A statement by Amnesty International said Maina was a talented goalkeeper, TEDx presenter, role model, future leader, loved by all. On the eve of December 23, 2018, Maina died at the hands of an AP officer in Kibera under unclear circumstances. He and his friends were returning from watching a football match when they were confronted by the officer. Born in Kibera, Maina excelled academically and earned a scholarship to study in Leeds. In the past three months, civil society organisations and community justice centres have documented over 30 cases of extra-judicial killings.

Although the Police are yet to make any arrests following Maina's death, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority has publicly stated that it is in the process of investigating the matter. The Police has also stated that it will abide by the recommendations made by IPOA. "We wish to inform the public that the Inspector General of Police has asked IPOA to expedite investigations into the shooting incident that occurred in Kibera within Nairobi County in which one Carilton Maina was shot and fatally injured," the NPS tweeted after the incident. "We emphasise on the need for greater individual and command responsibility; deeper and meaningful community policing; and, closer oversight by IPOA and other bodies such as Parliament and KNCHR," part of the Amnesty statement read.
