Reports indicate that Riziki had informed his wife that he was in Nairobi for unspecified work, three days prior to the attack. More reports say that Riziki sent huge amounts of money to his wife moments before the attack and told her to use it wisely. On January 7, police raided Riziki’s house in Majengo and picked his wife, Bakari for questioning. The 25-year-old terrorist dropped out of Form One at Bhadala Secondary School in Mombasa in 2011 before marrying Bakari in 2012. Police believe that Riziki was a close associate of Ismail Mohammed Shosi and a member of Al Shabaab hit squad that targeted police officers in order to steal their firearms. More police intelligence say Riziki was a member of the Al Shabaab unit Jaysh Al Ayman, which is believed to be operating in Boni Forest. The group is responsible for numerous fatal terror attacks in areas of Lamu and Mpeketoni in Kenya’s North Coast. Police have intensified the search for more terror suspects after last Tuesday's attack. Click here for the latest political news
