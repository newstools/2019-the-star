Crime rate has decreased in Dandora due to youth employment and involvement in Nairobi clean-up. Dandora Transformation League (DTL), an organisation established in the area, has recruited many youths, most of whom had been criminals. DTL chief executive Charles Gachanga said since the introduction of this estate transformation initiative by Governor Mike Sonko, many youths have become productive. “Previously we had a challenge of insecurity in this region because to youth unemployment and being idle,” he said. “However, through Governor Sonko, We have been able to mobilise the youth to form garbage collection groups, greening the area and other income generating activities.” Wilson Mutua, a resident of Dandora and a father of two, is optimistic that with the completion of the Dandora recycling plant, majority of the youths in the area will get employment. “We are appealing to Sonko to speed up the process of constructing this facility,” he said. In the past there has been many insecurity stories hitting the headlines, putting Dandora on the spot. The cases ranging from murder, theft and rape led to the emergence of a police group under the pseudo name ‘Hessy’. This group of police officers were and still are determined to fight crime in parts of Eastlands, Dandora being one of its main focus areas. The police, who warned people taking part in crime and even offered them alternatives to reform, do so through social media, Facebook being their main platform. Buruburu police boss Geoffrey Mayiek, also confirmed the reduced number of insecurity cases reported from Dandora. “You have also seen for yourself, there has been no cases of crime being reported from Dandora since the year started,” Mayiek told the Star yesterday According to residents, the area has now become peaceful and youth are now engaging in income generating projects without engaging in crime.
