Akothee has said she was touched by the story of the new signee in her record label. “I even shed tears in the studio and decided that I was going to support him in every way possible,” Akothee told Adelle and Shaffie on Kiss yesterday. The Coast-based rising star Ziky Mtanah says he met Akothee in 2016 and has finally released a new song titled ‘Basi’, featuring Akothee. “I had done an interview with a radio station and shared my story and Akothee was interviewed and she happened to listen to my songs, which she liked,” Ziky said. Ziky is an orphan and was working in a quarry when he met Akothee. “I was earning Sh200 a day to feed my brother and even record my music. When I met Akothee, she supported me so much to expand a business I was running selling vegetables, and I even moved from the Sh800 house I was living in,” Ziky said. Akothee signed him on her record label Akothee Empire and has been supporting him since then. “For the record label, it is not about me to make money but to support young talents that have the potential to make good music but do not have anyone to get them started,” she said. Akothee has also sponsored different students to join various high schools in Kenya this year by paying everything they need in school. “I am also looking for more that are really needy and performed well to join high school,” she said.
