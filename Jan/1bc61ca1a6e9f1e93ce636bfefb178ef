Good Morning. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday directed the police to deal ruthlessly with armed criminals when he visited the DCI headquarters on Kiambu road. Uhuru spoke at a closed-door meeting attended by DCI chiefs from the County to Regional level as he toured the head office and inspected the construction of the police forensic lab. Here are the stories making headlines in the Weekend Star this Saturday morning. Inside ex-VP Kijana Wamalwa’s property battle A vicious legal battle over the property of ex-Vice President Michael Kijana Wamalwa is tearing his family apart and has seen her last born daughter drop out of school. The property dispute pitting Wamalwa’s six children — four from different mothers — has delayed the processing of pension benefits of the flamboyant politician 15 years after his death. At the centre of the row is the multi-million Karen home that was partly paid for by the Kenyan government after Wamalwa’s death. _____________________________________________________ Proper documentations slows down SGR compensation Lack of legal documents threatens to delay construction of the second phase of the standard gauge railway. The National Land Commission yesterday said compensation for landowners has stalled even though a special team had been dispatched to fast-track the process. The 120km Nairobi-Naivasha line will cost Sh150 billion. The 27km stretch from Ngong is still having issues. The delay has caused endless squabbles pitting landowners against the contractor — China Communications Construction Company. _____________________________________________________ What does the new Executive Order mean? Earlier this week, President Uhuru Kenyatta issued an Executive Order that has shaken the political fabric of the country once more with many saying it has diminished the status of Deputy President William Ruto. Columist OCHIENG’ KANYADUDI argues that through the Executive Order No 1 of 2019, the President has effectively established a senior Cabinet office above the rest. On his part, KORIR SING’OEI says that the coordination role has never been donated to the Deputy President under this administration and thus cannot be said to have lost what he never had. _____________________________________________________ Is Oparanya becoming the next big 'thing' in Western politics Still waters run deep, so they say. This can be said of Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, who not only has his political clout bulging but his development record in his backyard has also been acknowledged. Unlike his towering stature, Oparanya, a certified public accountant is a man of few words, and is credited with various projects in roads, health and sports. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
