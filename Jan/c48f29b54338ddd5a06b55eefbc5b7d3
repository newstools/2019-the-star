Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has lately expressed his frustrations with the Judiciary for routinely freeing fraud suspects on lenient bond terms. Further, he is worried that the courts - in his words - are slowing down the fight against corruption by giving orders that undermine the resolve to stem the evil that has slowly but surely been ruining the future of this country. Last month, the DPP went out of his way to seek the intervention of Chief Justice David Maraga to ensure that conservatory orders granted by courts are not exploited by suspects to evade justice. Sadly, judges also allow constitutional office bearers charged with graft access to their offices before the determination of their cases. No wonder there have been reports of documents disappearing soon after some of the suspects are released on bond/bail. The spotlight is evidently on the Judiciary. Are the rights of some suspects absolute? It is time our judges woke up to the realisation that the public perceives them as persons easily corrupted by the wealthy to defeat the course of justice.
