Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) age grade and women’s rugby coordinator, Nick Aballa feels the decision by the Ministry of Education to have rugby 15’s and 7’s in first term of the schools calendar will affect the development of the game. He termed the decision as ill advised and not well thought out and called on stakeholders to review the position. “My personal opinion is that the move is wrong and if possible, it should be reviewed. Having rugby 15’s in Term One and 7’s in Term Two allows for further training and development,” said Aballa. He said having the two events in different terms allows schools that perform poorly 15’s to change their tactics ahead of the 7’s and this she said increases competition and development. Aballa also faulted the decision to reduce the number of participants in 15’s from 23-20 and in 7’s from 13 to 11. “In rugby 15’s you need more locks and forwards. Reducing the number of players per team will hurt the game,” he added. Aballa also said KRU were not invited to the stakeholders meeting which recommended the changes. The stakeholders retreat was held at Machakos University from October 8-10 last year. “As a federation, we should have been invited to the meeting to give our input. Since it’s the ministry which runs the games, we are now caught between the rock and a hard place,” he added. The new changes were contained in a circular released on Monday signed by Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang released.
