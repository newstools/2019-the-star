Several MPs and senators have called for a law under which the issuance of IDs will be carried out at county levels to eliminate bureaucracy. The call came at the end of a three-day workshop at the Great Rift Valley Lodge organised by UNHCR and KNCHR on the status of stateless people in the country. The legislators supported calls to digitise the issuance of IDs. According to Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa, the motion had been introduced in the last Parliament but it was never discussed. He said there was a need of the reintroducing the motion, noting that county officials stood a better chance of resolving the crisis around ID issuance. “Plans are underway to introduce a motion in Parliament so that the issuance of IDs can be devolved to county levels,” he told the press at the end of the workshop that brought together various stakeholders. The MP admitted that frontier counties were disadvantaged when it came to the process adding that tens of youths had missed out on the IDs. The sentiments were echoed by Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula who said that the process should be eased as the current one was very complex. He said that Senate and Parliament would in the coming weeks engage state actors over the issue. Read: Government recruiting agents for single ID registration Click here for the latest political news
