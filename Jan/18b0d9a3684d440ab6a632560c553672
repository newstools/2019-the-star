The Nyanza Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union on Friday issued a 14-day strike notice to the Migori county government. The county chief officer of Health has received the letter. Branch secretary Omweri Lameck Gisairo signed the letter dated January 4 addressed to the governor through the county secretary. He said the dispute on the breach of Collective Bargain Agreement has dragged on for long, and the county administration has failed to convene a CBA implementation meeting. "This is because of lack of commitment and willingness on the part of the county government of Migori as the employer to resolve the above issues," the letter read. Gisairo said the union remains available for dialogue within the 14 days. The letter has been copied to the county executive member for Health and the chief officer.
