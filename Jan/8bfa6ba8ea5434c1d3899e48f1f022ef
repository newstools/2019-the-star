Kenyans have expressed their frustration over the delays in getting prepaid tokens from the Kenya Power and Lighting Company. The problem has been experienced since Wednesday evening and Thursday morning. In a now-deleted tweet, the company said it was experiencing a delay in token generation. "Good morning. Our system is currently experiencing a delay in token generation. We request your patience as we send your tokens. Apologies for the inconvenience," the tweet read. Some of the customers however questioned why the company took so long to address the issue. "Surely Kenya Power, the least you guys should have done is to give warning about tokens," Lina Ogana tweeted. "More than 24 hours and you haven't resolved your token processing challenges. Does it mean the country should come to a halt because of your inefficiencies? It is quite annoying," @Kennedy_Burudi said. "How long did it take you to notice the delay? You are only apologising now yet you have ignored us since yesternight?" Silas Okumu asked. "Kenya Power token purchase system is a disgrace," Eric Nyaga said. Jamio Moses said: "Kenya power at this age we should not be asking you to do what you're supposed to do. Give us tokens or refund our money." @Agmerswiftmedia questioned why the lighting company was a monopoly. "What is happening? Is the token system not working since morning? Kenya power mistreats Kenyan because they are the only company doing this. We need private companies to be licensed," Agmerswiftmedia tweeted. Gideon Sagero said: "Kenya power we bought tokens yesterday until now you are sorting the issue? You cant be damn serious." @sammie37 said his business had been affected due to the power outage.
