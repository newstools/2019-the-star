The Moon will turn red in the early hours of Monday during a brief total Lunar eclipse between 06:34 am and 09:51 am. The total phase of the lunar eclipse will be visible from North and South America, Europe and western Africa. Central and eastern Africa and Asia will see a partial eclipse of the Moon. In Nairobi, the partial eclipse lasted for one hour and one minute between 5:36 am and 6:37 am. In the UK, the Moon began to darken at 2.35am with full eclipse beginning at 4.40am. The total eclipse will last between 4:41 and 5:43 in the UK. It is the last chance for UK observers to see a total lunar eclipse in its entirety until 2029. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes exactly between the Sun and the Moon creating a shadow which stops solar rays reaching the lunar surface. Click here for the latestÂ political news
