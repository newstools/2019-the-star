Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua has condemned youth, whom he called supporters of Governor Charity Ngilu, who violently broke up his press conference in Mwingi town. Wambua on Sunday said it was immoral for county government operatives to pay “clueless” youths to disrupt a meeting held within a church compound. The senator tried to hold a press conference at the sidelines of a ceremony to instal the Mwingi Area AIC Bishop Nicodemus Kituo. He had earlier told celebrants that he would call a meeting with the media to address issues of widespread corruption in Kitui but as he left the ceremony attended by Ngilu, a group of youths followed him. They started shouting, drowning him out, making him inaudible to the journalists’ video cameras and audio tapes. The leader’s security aide restrained the youths and at one point was seen trying to draw a gun. Wambua abandoned the briefing. Even as he walked to his car, the youths loudly accused him of being disrespectful to Ngilu. They threatened to pounce on him, prompting the intervention of two Administration Police officers who led Wambua to his car. He said violence by hired youth would not stop him from overseeing the use of funds and speaking up against corruption and arbitrary theft of funds.
