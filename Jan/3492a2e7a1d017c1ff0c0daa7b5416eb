The body of a missing motorcycle operator was found yesterday in a trench at Mai Mahiu trading centre. The man identified only as Njuguna went missing two days ago and was found by sand harvesters. Witness James Kamau said the man had just bought a new motorcycle and had ferried a customer on the day he disappeared. Kamau said that earlier in the day, Njuguna had been complaining that unknown people were following him. “His motorcycle was stolen and he had wounds to the neck, indicating he could have been strangled,” Kamau said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said an investigation was underway by DCI officers. The body was taken to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital mortuary.
