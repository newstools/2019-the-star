Allegations of abuse and sexual misconduct against RnB artist R Kelly are in the spotlight again as a six-part documentary series reignites public outrage. The three-night Lifetime series, "Surviving R. Kelly," brings together Kelly's accusers and inner circle to detail the artist's life that the network described as "riddled with rumors of abuse, predatory behavior, and pedophilia." Celebrities reacted to he docuseries. John Legend tweeted: "To everyone telling me how courageous I am for appearing in the doc, it didn't feel risky at all. I believe these women and don't give a fuck about protecting a serial child rapist. Easy decision." @TaranaBurke: Let me say this to Black folks who are saying foolishness like this. Shut up. It has taken 20 YEARS to get the mainstream media to shine a light on his depravity. He is not FACE of sexual assault. He is the subject of a doc that allows his survivors to be heard...finally." Nettie M Newsom: "Not watching. It's amazing how there are famous white men who committed sexual assault and you do not hear a peep from the media or these feminuts groups. But the face of sexual assault is the black man?" @ChrissyCole: "Black women have been telling us for years about #RKelly’s abuse. It’s 2019. And even with this thoroughly reported docu, folks still pledge their allegiance and coins to RK. Remember what I’m about to say next. You are complicit. The stain is on your hands too #SurvivingRKelly."
