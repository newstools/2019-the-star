Lurambi MP Titus Khamala has said he will not quit the ANC party and will not be pushed out by anybody. On Tuesday, Kakamega branch officials said they would recommend disciplinary action against the legislator and his Matungu counterpart Justus Murunga for “disrespecting” party leader Musalia Mudavadi and flirting with DP William Ruto. MCAs who visited Ruto’s Sugoi home last month were also reprimanded. On December 31, Khamala hosted Ruto for lunch at his Shibuli home before the DP went tto Matungu in Mumias. The lawmaker on Thursday dismissed claims he has joined the Ruto camp. “I’ve been elected on the ANC ticket. It’s my party and my leader is Musalia Mudavadi. If we have an election right now and Musalia is on the ballot, I’ll vote for him,” he said. “But now that there is no election, we can’t keep politicking for the next four years. Instead, we need to concentrate our energy on initiating development as mandated by the electorate.” He spoke at Matende Primary School, Lurambi, where he launched construction of four classrooms. Khamala said he is “a unique politician”,  given that besides being an MP, he is a religious leader — “a bishop, for that matter”. By virtue of his church role, he cannot discriminate against others or choose his visitors, he said.
