University leaders have petitioned the National Assembly to summon Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet over extrajudicial killings involving students. Led by the Kenya Union of Students Organisation (Kuso) chairman Anthony Manyara, the students claimed police have shot four of their colleagues dead and injured 17 during protests last year. They demanded Boinnet explain his continued silence on calls from victims and relatives of the affected families to seek justice. Kuso also accused the Independent Policing and Oversight Authority (Ipoa) of carrying out shoddy investigations on the reported cases.

They also cited 10 cases of police brutality inflicted on students last year. “There is lack of cooperation and full investigations, no independent postmortem report and lack of strengthened a witness protection mechanism. There is also delay in compensation awards and normalisation of extrajudicial killings by Kenyans,” Manyara said on Thursday. Kuso further blamed the IG saying he has failed in his constitutional obligation to investigate the use of excessive brutal force by police officers.
