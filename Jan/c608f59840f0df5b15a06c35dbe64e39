Kiambu agriculture chief John Ngigi has been directed by Governor Ferdinand Waititu to immediately proceed on annual leave. Waititu said his directive was informed by Ngigi’s prolonged stay at work due to the nature of his office. He said it had been impossible for Ngigi to take leave. Ngigi is a brother of Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria. “It has been noted that you have not taken your annual leave for some time due to the busy nature of your office. You are, therefore, advised to proceed for your annual 30 days leave with effect from Thursday January 3,” Waititu said. The governor directed Ngigi to hand over to the chief officer in charge of livestock, fisheries and veterinary services. He is expected to resume duty on February 14. Studies have shown some employees avoid taking their paid leave days due to fear of getting sacked. A research by Glassdoor done in 2017 indicated that 54 per cent of US employees refused to take their paid vacations because they believed they could be replaced while away from the office.
