Quickmart Supermarkets has opened its first 24-hour outlet in Lavington’s Valley Arcade as it count on quality services and convenience to penetrate the country’s competitive retail sector. The family owned supermarket chain started in 2006 is banking on the growing middle class and youthful population in Kenya to expand to more residential areas in and outside Nairobi. Quickmart’s latest strategic location is expected to serve customers in the wider Kilimani region that includes Kileleshwa and Lavington neighborhoods where residents have been having limited shopping options, relying on nearby malls that close before midnight. Quickmart's marketing head Betty Wamaitha said the retailer, is adding the time factor to its quality services to give customers both guaranteed price and convenience. "This area is populated by high-income shoppers who require the flexibility of shopping at any time. This one-stop branch will fill unmet shopping needs,” she said. The new Lavington branch brings the retailer’s total outlets to 10, adding to the two in Nakuru, and one each in Kahawa Sukari, Ruiru, Waithaka, Eastern Bypass, Ruaka, Ruai and another at Thindigua along Kiambu Road.
