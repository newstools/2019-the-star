ODM leader Raila Odinga has asked transport and logistics players to stop whining about the Sh327 billion SGR. He said though Kenya’s largest infrastructure project has led to loss of many jobs, the positives far outweigh the negatives. “We cry that the SGR has swallowed other jobs, but we can create more jobs,” Raila said on Monday in Mombasa. He said the government will do more to tap Mombasa’s potential. Firms in the transport, freight and warehousing industries on the Mombasa highway have recorded low business, with some closing. Raila led a barrage of criticism against the SGR on the same venue at least three times before the Monday event.
