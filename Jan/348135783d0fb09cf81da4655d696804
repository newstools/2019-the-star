The Auditor General has questioned Sh66 million spending by the Kakamega government to construct the governor’s residence. It is unclear whether the land set aside for the project belongs to the county or not. Ownership documents or title deeds were not presented for audit, the 2016-17 report by Auditor General Edward Ouko shows. The report indicates the county government spent Sh66,666,705. The report says the exact location of the governor’s residence is unclear as the contract number CGKK/OG/16/17/002 for the governor’s residence in Lugari differs from information posted on the county government’s website as tender No CGKK/OG/2016/2017/001 for the governor’s residence in Likuyani. The advertisement tender CGKK/OG/16/17/002 indicates the tender documents were placed in the tender box on March 13, 2017, and the bids were to be opened the same day. In the CGKK/OG/2016/2017/001 the tender documents were placed in the tender box on May 18, 2016, and bids were to be opened the same day. It says there were no minutes or reports to confirm if there was public participation for the project. The engineers’ estimates were also missing, the audit report says. The county bought assets worth Sh4,972,115,469 during the period under review. They included land, buildings, furniture and equipment. But the report says the county government has operated since its inception without an assets register, either in hard or electronic form, for effective administration of assets acquired and those inherited. The report also said the Kakamega government irregularly procured laptops worth Sh4,771,200 in 2016. Ouko said the contract of Sh4,771,200 was awarded to a local contractor to supply laptops on December 15, 2016, without a budget. The executive committee, the report says, had in a meeting on August 23, 2016, declined to approve the budget to expand a cash transfer programme. It is popularly known as Oparanyacare but the programme coordinator went ahead and awarded the tenders to supply the laptops. “The contractor signed the contract on December 15, 2016, and the Local Purchase Order was issued the same day. The laptops were delivered six days late,” the report says.
