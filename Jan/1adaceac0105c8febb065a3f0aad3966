Kenya Airways is set to begin direct flights to Italy and Switzerland in June. The national carrier will fly four times a week the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to the cities of Rome and Geneva. The flight will depart Nairobi every Wednesday and Sunday at 11:50 pm for Geneva Airport making a stop at Rome–Fiumicino International Airport. On Monday and Friday, the long-haul plane will depart at the same time, flying via Geneva and expected back after 19-hour flight. The airline had halted direct Nairobi-Rome flights in 2012, over a year since the route had been launched due to low passenger numbers. KQ operated three flights weekly to the Italian capital city every Monday, Thursday and Saturday. The mid-year resumptions and launch to Geneva will bring the destinations KQ serves in Europe to 5 and 55 worldwide. KQ chief executive Sebastian Mikosz expects to tap into comparative advantage in tourism and international diplomacy of the two cities to grow arrivals into the country. Rome is the third most visited city in Europe, popular for rich history of archaeological sites and Vatican Museums that attracts over 4.2 million tourists per year. While Geneva hosts the highest number of international organizations in the world such as the United Nations. “The addition of flights to Rome and Geneva will be welcomed by both our leisure and business customers. Kenya will make a connection to 43 other destinations in Africa,” Mikosz said. Tickets will be available for sale beginning January 22 with an introductory price on offer of Sh70,983 ($699) from Nairobi until February 15.
