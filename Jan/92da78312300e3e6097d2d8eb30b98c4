Former Nacada board chairman John Mututho yesterday expressed concern over the rise of underage drinking. He blamed parents for drinking in the full glare of their children. This influences the young ones to start drinking, oblivious of the dangers alcohol has, Mututho said. He warned that the problem could destroy society if swift action is not taken to fix it. “We’ve seen over the holidays parents openly drinking with their children. They think this is fun, but the minors end up copying what the parents do,” the former Naivasha MP said. He said the recent incident in which a high school student was found drunk in Nyeri was a clear indication of the depth of social rot among in Kenya. People no longer care about their morals, he said. Mututho urged that the student be taken to a rehab. “I know she is not alone. There are so many alcohol addicts at that age. This clearly shows how our society has changed,” he said. The girl had said she followed in the footsteps of her parents.
