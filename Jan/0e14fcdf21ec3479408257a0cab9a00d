A man was on Monday night allegedly killed by his two sons after a domestic squabble with his wife. Patrick Khalabai, 55, from Sindani village in Bungoma is said to have differed with his wife, before his two sons attacked him with a panga. Village elder Joan Simiyu said Khalabai went home at 9pm drunk and demanded his conjugal rights. She said the woman screamed for help and one of her sons went to check what was happening. Simiyu said the couple slept in different beds. “One of the sons broke down the door and found his mother screaming that their father wanted to rape her. He went back and returned with his brother. Both beat their father unconscious,” she said. The man suffered deep panga cuts on the head and leg. The sons left him for dead – alone in the house. In the morning, they found him in critical condition and took him to hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Villagers wanted to lynch the woman and her sons, but officers from Kimilili police station saved them. The woman and one of the sons were arrested. The other escaped. The officers are hunting for him. Simiyu urged residents to find other ways of solving domestic problems. She asked children not to side with one of their parents in disputes between parents. Police said the two will be arraigned in court after investigations.
