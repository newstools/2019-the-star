Police officers should be banned from engaging in private businesses to promote transparency and accountability. Candidate interviewed for the chairmanship of the National Police Service Commission called for the enactment of laws to ban civil servants and other government officials from doing private jobs. First woman AP officer Margaret Chege said engagement in private businesses gives police vested interests that compromise their mandate. David Ngetich said private businesses were the biggest facilitators of corruption and favouritism within the police service. “That law (allowing engagement in private businesses) opens loopholes and should be scrapped so officers can be loyal and work wholeheartedly,” Ngetich said. Raymond Nyeris said the ban should be widened to include all civil servants. “There is no way a police officer can be fair in enforcing rules in a business that he is engaged in,” Fred Lengees said.
