Bungoma residents have been urged to shun divisive politics and unite for development. The call came from governor Wycliffe Wangamati, who at the weekend urged residents in the county’s nine constituencies, to ensure that the devolved unit changed for the better. The governor said that the county needed quality road network across for him to achieve his development agenda. Better roads, he said, will enable residents, the majority of whom are farmers, to access markets and social amenities. “We have started with the construction of roads, and with roads come water, good drainage as well as street lighting. I urge residents to desist from encroaching on roads and allow quality work to be done,” he told a funeral service in Sirisia constituency. The governor said the county would provide adequate funding for education. “We are investing in infrastructure - which is good - but we need to do more by educating our children so they can do more in future and become responsible members of the society.” The governor explained that the county would roll out the second phase of scholarships to benefit more children through bursaries. The Ford Kenya party governor called for unity of purpose among local leaders ahead of the 2022 general elections. He asked the residents not to miss out during the August census as their allocation of national resources depended on their numbers. Wangamati was accompanied by Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu, Webuye West MP Dan Wanyama and Bungoma Woman Representative Catherine Wambilianga.
