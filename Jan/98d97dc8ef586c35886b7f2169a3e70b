The EU has called on the Democratic Republic of Congo to restore Internet access, which operators say was cut on government orders. The internet has been blocked since Monday, the day after the presidential election. The joint statement by the European Union, the United States, Canadian and Swiss heads of mission in Kinshasa was issued on Tuesday. The statement also refers to the election observers the National Episcopal Electoral Conference of Congo (Cenco) and an alliance of citizens' observer missions, Symocel. But the country's two main election monitors are still trying to get access to the election count, reports AFP news agency. The result is expected on January 6.
