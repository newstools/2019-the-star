Residents of Mwanzo Estate in Kiplombe ward, Eldoret town, have raised concerns over rising insecurity. Locals said they have to get home by 9pm to avoid being robbed. The situation has worsened due to dysfunctional street lights, they said. David Ochieng claimed police arbitrarily arrest residents walking at night for no reason. He said robbers have free rein because residents do not want to risk being caught by police and therefore do not go out to help theft victims. In reference to a recent fire incident where one person died, the victim’s children kept screaming but residents were reluctant to respond to the distress call for fear of being arrested by police, resident Joseph Mwangi said. “It is sad. This is not the first time insecurity has claimed the lives of our people. The county government has a role to play and it seems they have even forgotten Kiplombe ward,” Pamela Rahunga, a former MCA aspirant, said. Residents called for security to be beefed up.
