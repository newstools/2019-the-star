The Knut Bomet branch has asked its members to ignore a letter from the employer asking them to appear for the signing of performance appraisal tools. Branch executive secretary Malel Langat said “the process remains suspended until we arrive at an agreement with TSC as ordered by court.” Malel who was speaking to Star hit out at TSC over what he said had contravened the order by the Employment and Relations Court issued over the exercise. Malel said the conciliatory talks between the union and TSC was ongoing hence wondered why the commission had rushed into initiating the process in the region. Justice Bryam Ongaya had on January 2, issued stay orders on the exercise until when Knut and TSC will engage and agree over it. TSC wants all secondary school heads and curriculum support officers from Bomet Central and East subcounties are required to avail themselves today (Tuesday) and tomorrow (Wednesday) for the performance contract evaluation and signing for the year 2018/19. The letter dated January 24, is signed by TSC subcounty director W. Ng’olekamar. Read: Knut wants teacher appraisal suspended Click here for
