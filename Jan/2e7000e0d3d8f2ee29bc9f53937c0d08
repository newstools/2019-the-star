With relegation from the Football Kenya Football (FKF) National Super League staring at them in the face, Kakamega-based Green Commandos are now attributing the prolonged poor run to lack of funds, a factor that has majorly affected the players. Green Commandos coach Eliud Omukuyia, having witnessed yet another defeat at home to St. Joseph on Sunday, revealed that they have been hit by a serious financial crisis that has affected their performance. “The current situation at the team is quite worrying. There is no motivation among the playing unit and as a coach, it is difficult to bring the best out of the players who are not settled, with some unable to attend training due to lack of transport,” Omukuyia pointed out. “This year, our target was to fight and compete with big teams and finish among the best  as we aim to qualify and play in top tier league. However, we have realised that this dream will be an uphill funds without money.” He also revealed that the team did good recruitment and believes he has acquired the right players who can compete with the rest of the teams in the National Super League if only they could get financial support. Kakamega High School Principal Gerald Orina, whose students form the backbone of the Green Commandos, revealed that it has become tough to meet day to day expenses of the team. “We are the sponsors of the team but we can’t only rely on school budget which is strictly  meant for the learning students. However, we have also made some contacts and made a lot of appeals to well-wishers to come and support the team,” said Orina.
