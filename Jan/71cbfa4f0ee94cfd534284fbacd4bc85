A Makadara court has directed Buruburu DCI to investigate allegations that a police officer attached to the station threatened a complainant to withdraw a fraud case. Veronicah Wanjiru told the court that police constable Alfred Mwenda coerced and threatened her to write and sign a letter withdrawing a case in which Esther Wangui is charged with obtaining Sh740,000 by false pretense. “The officer called me to the police station and forced me to sign a withdrawal letter because the accused person is my sister,” she told the court. She added:“ I didn’t give my correct signature but he forced me sign again and later had to put my genuine signature.” Mwenda admitted in court that he came to know about the case at the police station. He told court that he read a statement from the accused, Wangui, and realised that the two were related. “As an officer I inquired why sisters had criminal cases because there is another matter civil case at Milimani court which am i am the investigating officer,” Mwenda said. “I summoned the complainant to meet and we talked at length. I wanted them to reconcile because their parents had passed.” He said he encouraged both to talk and help reconcile as a family. He denied use of threats and coercion. However, the magistrate questioned why Mwenda would want to reconcile siblings in an ongoing case. “Why would you want a case that has been in court since 2017 to be withdrawn and yet you are not an investigating officer?” the magistrate posed. He directed the DCI to investigate the matter and a report brought to court on February 12 when the case will be heard.
