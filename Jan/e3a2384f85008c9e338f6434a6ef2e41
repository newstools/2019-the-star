48 people were arrested on Saturday night during a crackdown by NEMA, Nacada and city inspectorate officials on nightclubs that are flouting operation regulations. The operation targeted entertainment joints which have been selling shisha products, contravening of Liquor licensing conditions and noise pollution. By 9 pm several clubs within the CBD, Kilimani, Westlands and along Mombasa and Langata roads were raided by the joint team. The operation team also included Liquor and licensing, Tobacco control, public health and the administration police. They raided Blend at Nextgen Mall, Milan club, Mirage plaza, Pistop, Rafikiz, Tav and Florida 2000. Those arrested were booked at Kamkunji and Central police stations and will be arraigned tomorrow. Over 100 shisha bongs and ingredients were impounded and will be availed as evidence in court. Others included sound amplifying equipment. In January 2018, NEMA launched a crackdown on clubs aimed at tightening its monitoring of clubs that operate in residential areas within the city. City clubs including Jiweke Tavern, B Club, Kiza and Space Lounge were closed for some time as a result of noise pollution.
