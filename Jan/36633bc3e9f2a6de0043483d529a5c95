One of the four people charged with carrying out a terror attack on Narobiâ€™s Westgate Mall in September 2013 was freed yesterday for lack of evidence. Chief magistrate Francis Andayi acquitted Abdikadir Adan alias Adan Dheq but said three others he was charged with have a case to answer. The three are Mohamed Abdi, Liban Omar and Hussein Mustafah. They were jointly accused of carrying out the terror attack in which 67 people died. Dheq had been charged with providing accommodation to Mohamed Abdi in his house along Muyuyu Avenue in Eastleigh knowing that he had committed an act of terrorism. He faced another charge of procuring a Kenyan identity card in Mandera on July 13, 2010, while he was a national of Somalia. The freed man was also accused of being unlawfully present in Kenya. The other three were charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism among other charges. They have denied the accusation. They have also denied aiding terrorist groups and being in Kenya illegally. The prosecution has more than 140 people to testify against them.
