Kiambu woman representative Gathoni Wa Muchomba has said balancing family life and politics is not easy. "Although I am happily married to a supportive husband, it is very difficult, but I have to create time for my family," she told Radio Jambo on Tuesday. Despite her busy schedule with the county government, Gathoni said she ensures she has dinner with her husband on a daily basis. "I cook for them once in a while, apart from Friday and Saturday, when we go for golf with my friends," she said. Gathoni has often been the subject of controversy, most recently when she had a spat with Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu after both took credit for the successful rehabilitation of alcohol addicts. Wamuchomba, who has approached the vice through medical interventions and psycho-social support services, criticised Waititu for paying addicts Sh400 a day to keep them away from the vice. "We disagreed because of the tactics he is using to deal with drug addicts in Kiambu," she said. "Kenyans should understand me that I am no longer a radio presenter. I am that one person who talks the truth. I don't talk about fame but the truth. I am not doing populist politics but instead, I am doing tactical politics and that is why many people hate me. The truth will always win." She said despite her disagreement with politicians, her husband is very supportive. "Every queen has a king to conquer. He is my first gentleman and he comes first before everyone. I have money and am powerful but when I am home, I am a wife to my husband," Gathoni said. "This is because I don't want people to continue stereotyping women politicians not keeping their family. It is everyone's decision to be responsible in marriage."
