Kenya have crashed out of the title contention of the fourth women’s Statehood Day International tournament staged at the Imphal grounds in Manipur State, India yesterday. The team comprising of Rowena Stitchbury, Phyllipa Martian, Hiromi Nzomo, Chess Millar and Georgina Millar lost 7-3 to Argentina’s Victoria Mihanovic, Mora Aldao, Martina Garrahan, player-coach Catalina Ayerza, Elina Braun and Delfina Braun. The win saw Argentina romp into the final having won 3-5 over hosts Manipur State on Thursday. Each team was given 10 ponies in first two chukkas and in the second half of the game, the outfits swapped horses. Kenya got off to a great start with a quick goal in the 44th second of the game by Cheza who connected well with a long pass from Hiromi from the centre. The highly defensive game came to a stop when Georgina’s pony left the field of play and ran back to the stables. But even after she returned to the pitch, no goal was forthcoming. In the second chukka, Argentina garnered two goals as Ayerza cancelled Cheza and barwly’s goal a minute later. Elina gave the South American side a 2-1 lead through penalty shot. Fifteen seconds prior to the breather, Cheza added a goal to level the scores at 2-2. On resumption, it was clear that swapping of ponies did not work for Kenya. The Stichbury-led squad definitely played higher handicap compared to the ponies Argentina mounted in the first 14 minutes. “We hoped to have a good second half but it was not to be,” said Stitchbury. The Argentine ladies had a field day in the third period as Elina intercepted a ball from the Kenyan back-line resulting into a goal. Even after her stirrup fell off the saddle and she tumbled,  Delfina managed to extend the lead 4-2. In the last chukka, Elina netted a double in three minutes as Ayerza made it 7-2.  Fortunately, two minutes to stoppage time, Marrian converted Kenya’s last penalty shot to trail 7-3.
