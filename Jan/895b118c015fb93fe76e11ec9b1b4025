Former Senator Kyle McCarter has been confirmed as the new US Ambassador to Kenya. The fluent Swahili speaking McCarter takes over from Robert Godec who has served for six years at the helm. Godec made the confirmation on Thursday via Twitter. “Congratulations Kyle McCarter on your confirmation by the U.S. Senate as the next U.S. Ambassador to Kenya. It's been an honour and privilege to serve here for six years,” he tweeted on Thursday. “Lori (Magnusson) and I will forever cherish our friendships and memories of this beautiful country and its extraordinary people,” he added. President Donald Trump appointed McCarter of downstate Lebanon in March 2018 to replace Godec. He and his wife, Victoria, have lived in Kenya doing charity work with Each One Feed One International, which has an office in Mukothima, in Tharaka Nithi County. According to the White House, McCarter has also served as a field auditor, missionary, and international director of the charity group based in Lebanon, Illinois. Godec has served both in former US President Barack Obama's regime and the current government led by Trump. He was nominated by Obama on September 19, 2012, and was sworn in by the then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on January 16, 2013. Godec is the longest-serving US envoy, not just to Kenya but also in the world, having stayed for slightly over six years. Most US ambassadors serve for three years.
