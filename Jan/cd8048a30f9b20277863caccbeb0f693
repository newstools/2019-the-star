Police at Konoin in Bomet county have launched investigations into the cause of death of a middle-aged man whose body was found at a tea plantation in the area on Friday morning. Konoin police boss Alex Shikondi said they are yet to arrest any suspect in connection with the incident which security officers are treating as a violent robbery. Speaking to the press, Shikondi said the lifeless body of the man which had a deep cut on his head was stumbled upon by a resident near Chemokos estate of the expansive Unilever tea estate who later alerted the area chief. The deceased who is a bodaboda rider, the OCPD noted, was last seen at Kimulot trading centre at around 9 pm on Thursday. He said they received the report from the area Chief on Friday morning. “From the locals and his close friends, the deceased was at the centre on Thursday until 9 pm before he left for his home,” Shikondi said. The police boss said they had gathered information that the deceased may have refused to surrender his motorcycle to the robbers who seemed to have trailed him. Shikondi urged members of the public to volunteer any information that might lead to the arrest of the killers. The body of the deceased was moved to the Kapkate hospital morgue.
