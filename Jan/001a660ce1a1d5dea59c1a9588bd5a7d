Ford Kenya is in no way associated with Deputy President William Ruto, Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati has said. “I categorically say the party has not entered any agreement with any presidential candidate for 2022 presidential election,” the governor said. Party MCAs from Busia and Bungoma were part of a delegation that visited Ruto at his home in Sugoi, Uasin Gishu county on Wednesday. The delegation pledged to support Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. Wangamati criticised the party members, saying they made the pledge on their own and not on behalf of the party. He spoke during an inspection tour of road works in Maraka ward, Webuye East constituency on Thursday. According to Wangamati, those who went to Sugoi were on their own mission. “As at now, we as Ford Kenya are forging alliances with ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi and Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa in preparation for taking over the presidency in 2022,” he said. He was disappointed with leaders who were praising neighbours at the expense of their own brothers and sisters. Wangamati said party leader leader Moses Wetang’ula had announced his presidential bid and asked members to support the Bungoma senator. Ford Kenya elected leaders at the Ruto home included Bungoma woman representative Catherine Wambilianga, Kabuchai MP James Lusweti and several Bungoma MCAs. Also present were Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, MPs Didmus Barasa (Kimilili), John Waluke (Sirisia), Dan Wanyama (Webuye West), Mwambu Mabonga (Bumula), Oku Kaunya (Teso North) and Geoffrey Omuse (Teso South). Busia governor Sospeter Ojamong of ODM was also present. Wangamati said there were mistakes in the graveling of some roads. He said he will send back the contractor to correct the mistakes. The governor was with roads executive Collins Mukhongo and Maraka MCA Ali Balala.
