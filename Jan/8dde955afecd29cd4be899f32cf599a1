A bright girl in Embu is unable to report to secondary school due to lack of fees. Caroline Wambui obtained 372 marks in last year’s examination and was expected to join Asumbi Girls High School by last week. Wambui, who lives with her three cousins in a rented one bed-room house in a Siakago town slum. was the best performer at Kimangaru Primary School in Mbeere North sub-county. One of her teachers, Agnes Oduor, told the Star yesterday that Wambui completed school under a lot hardship as her mother suffers from an illness of the spine that has confined her to a wheelchair. Her aunt, who has been supporting her, is also unwell. Oduor said teachers at the school have been helping Wambui. “My mum who relies on a wheelchair to move after she got spine complications lives in Nairobi with one of my aunts who takes care of her,” Wambui said. “Sometimes I am unable to get clothes and food and my teachers have been helping us with the items.” Wambui wants to become a surgeon in future but she fears she might not realise her dream.
