Three workers were injured after a bridge they were constructing collapsed at Loboi in Baringo South on Wednesday. Loboi chief Festus Kiptisya said the victims were rushed to Baringo County Referral Hospital in Kabarnet town. “The three were on top of the bridge when it suddenly caved in," Kiptisya said. He trio were discharged on Wednesday evening. The incident happened barely a week after MP Charles Kamuren, Governor Stanley Kiptis and Mochongoi MCA Kipruto Kimosop visited the site on January 18. They urged the contractor to speed up the works. The bridge connects Lake Bogoria Game Reserve and the famous Spa Hotel. It was washed away by floods in June last year. The tender for its construction was awarded by Kenya Rural Roads Authority in September last year. “It was to be completed early this year before the rains starts but now since it has collapsed we expect a further delay hence locking out tourists and visitors from accessing Lake Bogoria” he said a resident Levy Kibor. Kibor who witnessed the incident, blames the contractor for not hiring a crane to stretch the heavy bridge metals “instead he tasked 16 male casual laborers to do the tedious job” he said. Reports further indicates that the works Engineer and the contractor have since not been in good working terms. “The Engineer had suggested longer metallic pillars to be stretched across the river but the contractor opposed terming it expensive” source said. Last year, Baringo Assembly Speaker David Kiplagat called upon the national government to conduct a thorough audit on all county projects to avert immediate and future disasters. "Let us not wait until a disaster happens so that we act, we need to be vigilant to prevent loss of property and lives" Kiplagat said. He also noted that he hopes for a law in future that will compel engineers who constructing projects like bridges, dams and buildings to take responsibility in case of resultant damages.
