Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has asked police officers to change their attitude towards the public so they can cooperate in dealing with crime. Matiangi said crime rate can be significantly reduced if police officers work with members of the public, religious leaders and civil society groups. Speaking in Nairobi yesterday, the CS asked top police commanders to look for ways of working with their juniors to curb rising cases of suicide. “Service is about interacting with the people you are working with. It is not about bossing people. Police must walk away from that habit,” Matiangi said.

Matiangi attributed cases of police officers taking their lives to frustrations that they were undergoing in the course of work. He said there was need for the National Police Service to build mentorship groups that include senior commanders. The bosses will mentor their juniors and help them deal with challenges faced at work. “Some of these officers could be facing challenges such as disagreeing with their girlfriends. For a young person, they think it is the end of the world. They need guidance,” Matiangi said. Inspector General Joseph Boinnet said senior police chiefs will be trained on how to work with regional commissioners. Boinnet said the training is in line with the directive issued by President Uhuru Kenyatta for coordination between the police bosses and regional commissioners. Uhuru directed that police chiefs work jointly with regional commissioners to deal with corruption within their areas of command.
