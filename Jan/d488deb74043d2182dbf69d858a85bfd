Others are Kagwiria Mbogori (KNCHR), Joyce Mwikali (Gender Commission) and Samson Kibii. Former NPSC officials exited office in October last year following the end of their six-year term. The team was chaired by Johnston Kavuludi. On September 12, the Commission said it was unable to fully discharge its mandate because President Uhuru Kenyatta usurped its powers. Chairman Kavuludi singled out the 2014 amendment to the National Police Service Act and the National Police Service Act that snatched its power to recruit the Inspector General and his two deputies. The commission also identified the Judiciary and threats against the commission chairman during the vetting of police among challenges it faced. The commission came to office in 2012 and has vetted more than 10,000 officers. Click here for the latest political news
