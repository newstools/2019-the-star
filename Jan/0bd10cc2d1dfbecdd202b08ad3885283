Secondary schools in Samburu registered a low turnout of students joining Form One on the first day. Some received less than five students by 1pm while others had less than 20 lining up to be registered. Headteachers told the Star on Monday most students who were called through the ministry's NEMIS system might not report to schools. Kirisia Boys Secondary School in Samburu Central got a list of 120 students from the ministry, but only 20 had reported at 2pm. Principal Kennedy Lengoiboni said Samburu is a vast county that is why most students do not make it on the first day. "Samburu is large and Maralal is a sleepy town, most shops do not open during the weekend. Being a Monday, parents could be shopping for their children so that they bring them to school tomorrow," he said. Lengoiboni said they expect students from Samburu Central to report on the first day. At AIC Moi Girls, an extra county school expecting 240 students, five students had reported by 3pm. Principal Alice Gituru, said many are expected to report on January 10 and 11 for admission. She said the county is both arid and semi-arid, as a result, some parents have not been able to download the admission forms to know the schools their children are supposed to join. "We have been having challenges here every year, we register very low turn out on the first day," she said. Educationist officials said extra county schools in Samburu are likely to get few students because those called from far-flung counties tend are unlikely to report. Principals said students who will not have reported by the end of the week will be replaced. Click here for the latest political news
