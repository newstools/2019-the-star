Gospel singer Ole Willy has been accused by his baby mama, Lyn, of neglecting a child he sired out of wedlock, and deceiving her he was single yet he was married. Ole has featured in various collabos, among them 'Hafungi Macho' featuring Daddy Owen and Danco and 'Khubira Byosi' featuring Pastor Timothy Kituyi. Lyn told Word Is Ole Willy, who is married with two children, has deprived her of child support, and it's hard for her to raise their two-year-old son. "I met Ole Willy at a city night club back in 2016 and was introduced to him by a mutual friend. We clicked and started dating," she said. "In the same year, I gave birth and we kept it on the low. He promised to be sending 5k every month for the child's upkeep, but he rarely fulfills his promise. At times he sends less or doesn't send anything at all. In December he sent 2k only." The young woman said she didn't know Ole Willy was married and what profession he was in, until she got pregnant. "I started digging for information about him to know the kind of man my baby daddy was, only to find out that out that he had a family," she said. Lyn said she is struggling to raise the child alone, and all she needs is for the gospel artiste to step up and be a responsible father. She says any time she talks about him not being supportive, his narrative remains the same. "He keeps telling me that if I go to court, he will not provide even that 2k. And exposing him will be a waste of time because his fans will shut me up," she said. Adding: "He has never even bought a pair of socks for his son." The single mother says all she wants is for him to take responsibility for his child, adding that raising a child alone is not easy. When reached for comment, Ole Willy was brief and promised to call us back. "Whether I have a kid out of wedlock or not, in our culture I know it sounds bad. Because people will see you like you've been sidetracked or something," he said.
