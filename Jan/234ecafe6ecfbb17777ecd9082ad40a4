After parting ways with Kenya Commercial Bank, Lucy Mumo and Lydia Too have found a new home at the Directorate of Criminal Investigation ahead of this year’s Kenya Volleyball Federation national league. The league serves off on March 1 at the Kitale grounds in Trans Nzoia County. The two were part of the seven players shown the door at KCB before eventually making the cut in the 18-strong DCI squad picked during the just concluded trials at the Kenya Forest Service grounds. Too, brings on board the much needed experience and exposure to the side that parted ways with six players. DCI team manager Neddy Kilimo, said: “We are not afraid to start all over again. I believe the squad we have will definitely ruffle a few feathers in the league but bottom line is that we are targeting a play-off slot after missing out last season.” DCI, who made their maiden appearance in the league last season and finished fifth, have parted ways with Veronica Makokha, Sherlyne Maywa, former captain Lucy Sakong, Naomi Musobo, Winnie Nyamai and Viola Chepkurui. They have recruited Bungoma County trio of Marion Indeche, Emily Kisa and Joan Barasa. Others are Mercy Letting from Kenya Defence Forces, Bela Nadia from Kahawa, Maureen Wekesa from Kenyatta University, Angela Musamali from Chebororwo Secondary School, Carolyne Jeruto from Cheptil and Cecilia Chepkoech.
