Police in Ngong are holding a woman arrested while trying to escape from her Mathare home where her husband was found murdered. Kajiado North subcounty police commander Joseph Mwika on Thursday said the woman was confronted by neighbours who handed her over to officers. "The body of her husband was found in a pool of blood. There are indications a sharp object was used to slit his body,” he said. "From the look of things, it appears the couple has been having frosty relations for quite a while according to their neighbours." The mother of a two-year-old is being treated as a suspect. Witnesses said neighbours confronted her after she was found loading household items onto a truck. The murdered man - Peter Kiarie (48) - was a businessman in Ngong. “We applaud Mathare residents for their proactiveness in the Nyumba Kumi Initiative that helped them be inquisitive and take quick action to investigate," Mwika said. “The woman will now be taken to court after the police complete their investigations." Mathare slums Nyumba Kumi chairman Charles Kigia advised married couples to seek a separation in case of irreparable differences. Click here for the latest political news
