One year after the resignation of the Nairobi Deputy Governor, Governor Mike Sonko is set to appoint a replacement on Friday. Addressing the media in a Mombasa hotel, Sonko said he has already settled on the person who will replace Polycarp Igathe. Sonko said the delays in the appointment were caused by consultations between various stakeholders, including his party. "After a year, I have finally settled on one person whom I will name on Friday," he said. The governor hinted to the Star that he will definitely appoint a woman for gender equality. He refused to give more details, saying people should be patient. However, reports indicate the governor is likely to appoint someone from the Central region. The governor downplayed rumours that the city is in crisis for not having a deputy. "We are very stable without a DG. No crisis whatsoever," he said. In August last year, Sonko requested his supporters on social media to pick a deputy for him among four names he had given out. Among those he suggested for the seat were Agnes Kagure, Bishop Marget Wanjiru, Karen Nyamu and Jane Weru. He had also included Miguna Miguna, who however turned down the offer. Sonko said he will also name his new cabinet after making changes in several posts. He said he will retain executives who have shown the will to work for mwananchi, while the corrupt will be shown the door. On January 2018, while tendering his resignation, Igathe said he had failed to earn the trust of the governor to enable him to drive administration and management of the county. "Without fear, favour or ill will, I step down to avoid abusing or betraying my oath of office to Kenyans, Nairobians and my family. Thank you for the encouraging support given to me so far," he said. Before his resignation, Igathe had denied claims of a fallout with Sonko. His resignation also came after massive complaints from Nairobians that the two had not done a better job in the city.
