Kenya will be conducting its National Population and Housing Census in August at a cost of Sh18.7 billion. The mammoth task conducted after every 10 years involves the counting of all Kenyan citizens in an exercise that captures their age, sex, race, education levels, mortality, income and housing conditions, among many other factors. A census captures a country's numerical profile, which is key for planning. In Kenya, the count more often than not takes a political dimension because of vested interests in the numbers, mainly for resource sharing and political hedging. The results of the last two censuses were disputed, with sections of leaders claiming they were doctored to shore up the numbers of particular regions and communities. In 2009, the matter ended up in court and for 10 years the country based its planning on unverified numbers. A rigged census perpetuates marginalisation, lopsided planning and unfair allocation of resources. As they say, numbers don't lie but they are so easy to manipulate and misrepresent. With the huge financial and technical investment put in for the August exercise, we expect a flawless, transparent and accurate census.
