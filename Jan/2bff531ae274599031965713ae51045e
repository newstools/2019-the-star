Garissa leaders have strongly condemned as cowardly attempts by suspected al Shabaab militants to attack a Chinese road construction camp site in Shimbirey. Four people were injured when hooded men attacked the camp on Sunday night. The militias were however repulsed by security officers manning the camp. Speaking separately to the press in Garissa town, the leaders, who included Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Amey and Garissa County Peace secretary Hassan Osman, urged area residents to work closely by providing actionable information to security agencies. “It is now evident that al Shabaab wants to retard development and cripple economic growth in the county. It is time, as a community, we came together to denounce terrorism in its all forms,” Osman said. The Chinese company is tarmacking the 160km of Nuno-Modogashe road, which is expected to be completed soon. Hassan said the region had never witnessed such huge investment in improving infrastructure since Independence. “In fact, this is our first major infrastructure project and it is close to our hearts. So, any effort to stall or frustrate the same will be met with resistance,” he said. Amey urged the three governors of Mandera,Wajir and Garisssa set aside a kitty from their allocation that will be used in youth anti-radicalisation programmes. He said although the three counties have shown resolve to fight terrorism, there is need to do more by engaging the youth who are the most vulnerable. Dubat said it is now the responsibility of every Kenyan to take personal responsibility for security.
