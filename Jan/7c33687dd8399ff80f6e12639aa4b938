Tuk-tuk operators in Limuru town, Kiambu, have accused matatus of trying to evict them from a terminus. A planned protest by tuk-tuk operators yesterday was thwarted by police.Traffic police led by base commander John Bosco Mulei assured the protesters that their grievances will be addressed. Trouble started when the Michuki rules were enforced on November 12 and most matatus left the terminus to comply with them. The tuk-tuk operators approached the Kiambu government and requested for a parking bay at the terminus. They were allowed. Operator Mungai Mwangi said they ferry customers from Limuru town up to Ngarariga. “We charge Sh30 per passenger while the matatus charge Sh40,” he said. Matatu driver Simon Njoroge said tuk tuks should not operate like matatus as they are taxis. Yesterday Limuru deputy county commissioner David Kiprop said officials representing motorcycle riders, tuk-tuks, the matatu saccos, the county government and the police will meet to resolve the issue.
