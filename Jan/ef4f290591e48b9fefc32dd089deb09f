A Garissa county executive has urged residents to support the administration’s efforts to replan Garissa town to make it a modern municipality. Lands and urban services executive Mohamed Shalle said his department was ready to kick off a major re-planning exercise with the help of the Ministry of Lands. “Residents can’t access social amenities due to poor planning. People settled haphazardly and we must re-plan this municipality to attract investors,’’ Shalle told residents at a local hotel yesterday. Garissa town was elevated to a municipality status through the approval of the County Assembly and a charter signed by governor Ali Korane. He said the county faced challenges including population growth that affected grazing land. “We need to have an attitudinal change on matters land if we seriously want the current situation to be corrected,” he said. He asked participants, among them religious leaders, business people, professionals, politicians and civil society members, to spearhead campaigns to have a “governable society that is focused.” Last month, Lands CS Farida Karoney said the national government will support the county in re-planning the town.
