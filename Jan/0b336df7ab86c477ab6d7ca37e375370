The box office hit picked up best ensemble cast award in a motion picture, the SAG ceremony's version of the best film prize. Sunday’s night event also saw Black Panther won best action performance by a stunt ensemble. The film produced by Stan Lee Jack Kirby which originated from Wakanda land in Africa featured many renowned film actors including Lupita Nyong'o who played Nakia’s role, Black Panther's love interest and female warrior of the kingdom of Wakanda. Black Panther, which features Kenya's Lupita Nyong'o, received seven nominations at the Oscars. In 2018 it won the biggest film award in 2018 and will make history as the first comic book superhero movie to receive the award if it wins this year's Oscars. Other film nominations for Best Original Song include The Place Where Lost Things Go, Trip a Little Light Fantastic (both from Mary Poppins Returns), Shallow (A Star Is Born), The Big Unknown and All the Stars.
