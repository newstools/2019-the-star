Kenya Sevens forward Willy Ambaka has been nominated for the Male Player of the Year Award in the upcoming Sports Personality of the Year Awards (SOYA) set for Mombasa mid this month. Ambaka will battle it out with world and Commonwealth Games 1500m champion Elijah Manang’oi, world and Olympic 3000m steeplechase champion Conseslus Kipruto and Harambee Stars goalkeeper Patrick Matasi, who turns out for Ethiopian side St Georges FC. Ambaka played a prominent role as Kenya qualified for two main cup finals in the 2017/18 world sevens series in Vancouver and Hong Kong with Shujaa losing both finals to Fiji. Kenya finished the season with 104 points, their highest ever points tally. He also played at the Commonwealth Games and World Cup Sevens tournaments in Gold Coast and San Francisco, USA respectively. Ambaka also donned the Kenya 15s jersey during the Africa Gold cup and the repechage where the Simbas finished last behind eventual qualifiers Canada, Germany and Hong Kong. Ambaka was delighted with the nomination. “It’s been a good year for the Sevens team getting to two cup finals and registering the highest points tally was a milestone and I look forward to the event ceremony,” said Ambaka. Kenya Lionesses’ Janet Okello will battle with Fatuma Zarika (boxing), world 5000m champion Hellen Obiri, world 3000m steeplechase record holder Beatrice Chepkoech and Africa cross country champion Celliphine Chespol in the women’s category. Africa champions and Safari 7s winners, Kenya Lionesses, have been nominated for the Women’s Sports Team of the Year. Other teams in the category include Malkia Strikers, KPA and Equity basketball teams. The voting processing is ongoing and it will close on January 9.
