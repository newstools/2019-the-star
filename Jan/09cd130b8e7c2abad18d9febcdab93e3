Grandpa Records CEO Refigah on Tuesday announced the return of his label after 22 months away from the music industry. Asked why so after a long hiatus, he said, "Wasafi has been around for at least three years. Diamond was the only one penetrating Kenya. "Diamond and Wasafi Records are taking over in Kenya because Grandpa was away and the industry was unable to replace them.'' Refigah introduced two new artistes under his label, Mistony, a UK-based Kenyan pop artiste, and Naiweti, a Baringo artiste who has a new collabo with Wyre The Love Child. He also decried the lack of enough content and airplay on Kenyan radio and TV. Refigah refuted reports that he had gone broke, saying he had put his efforts into building his brand and real estate business.
