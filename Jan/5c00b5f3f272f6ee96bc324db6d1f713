High court judge David Majanja has awarded Sh8 million to three men linked to the 2010 Kampala bombings. Mohammed Adan Abdow, Mohammed Hamid and Yahya Suleiman Mbuthia were arrested in 2010, handed over to Ugandan authorities and charged. The group were acquitted in Uganda last year and their families filed a suit saying their rights were violated. The three suspects were extradited without following lawful procedure and their houses searched without a warrant, the court was told on Tuesday. Margaret Oumo Oguli, a judge at the International Crimes Division, terminated the proceedings against the three Kenyans and two Ugandans who had been recharged with terrorism-related offences in 2016 following the state requests. Majanja's decision came a day after another suspect charged over the 2013 Westgate attack - Adan Dheq - was cleared of charges. He had been accused of conspiracy to carry out a terror attack alongside another three suspects who have a case to answer.
