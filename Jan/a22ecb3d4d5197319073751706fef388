Rice production in Western Kenya is expected to double with the introduction of a second growing season. In the past farmers have been growing the cereal only between June and October. Now a second season will last from January to June. The National Irrigation Board Western Kenya manager Joel Tanui said farmers at Ahero, West Kano and Bunyala irrigation schemes will have two planting seasons in a year to help in the achievement of food security under the Big Four Agenda. Tanui called on the farmers to maximise production throughout the year. “On matters of food security, as a scheme we realised that since we cannot expand the land size, we can expand by double cropping,” he said. Tanui said the board is ready to assist farmers to till their farms, provide water, seeds and fertiliser. He was speaking at West Kano irrigation scheme. He called for better marketing of the produce to help farmers. He disclosed that the board has approached other government agencies to sign agreements with farmers for marketing purposes. The manager said there is a need to streamline marketing to weed out middle men who have over the years swindled farmers. “Streamlining marketing has been a big issue in the rice subsector particularly in this region, and that’s why majority of farmers sell to Ugandan traders. We have talked to our partners Lake Basin Development Authority, National Cereals and Produce Board and Western Kenya Rice Mills to sign contracts with the farmers.” West Kano irrigation officer Kennedy Ouma complained that water hyacinth had hampered water flow in Lake Victoria for irrigation purposes. He noted that dredging is tedious and expensive.
