Hip hop artiste Juliani is pushing for the country to have equality.Â "It is a personal responsibility to help fight inequality," Juliani told Word Is on Tuesday. "As a youth, you can do this by how you vote and connect with people who are like you to help you push your agenda ahead." Juliani also said he will ensure he spreads the message of equality in his music. "As a citizen of this country and not from any community, I will create awareness either directly or indirectly, but the message is that a song can only inspire but it is all about me to go beyond that and push the song." Juliani is looking forward to releasing a new album called 'Master Piece', as well as have a project on waste recycle, where we will try and employ more youths.
