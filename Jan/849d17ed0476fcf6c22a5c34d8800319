Roadside hawkers in Kiambu have been ordered to relocate to the markets built by the county government. “From today, let no one be found selling on the roadside. We want everybody in the markets which we have built to create a fair way for our people to do business,” governor Ferdinand Waititu said. He said the order is meant to ease congestion along the roads as well as inculcate discipline among traders. Customers should go to designated areas to buy what they want, the county chief said. “We have used money to construct markets which are located at convenient places. We do not want to see people selling things at the road,” the governor said. The designated markets will ease the collection of revenue, Waititu said. The governor spoke in Ruiru on Tuesday when he inspected work on a market under construction. He said traders are being relocated to pave the way for the construction of the Sh201 million Ruiru main market. The multi-storeyed facility will accommodate all businesses, he said. The governor said this financial year his government is putting up modern markets in Juja at a cost of Sh167 million, Kihara (Sh171 million), Kikuyu (Sh287 million) and Githurai (Sh500 million). “In all subcounties we will have modern markets and in this financial year we will construct five with support of the national government,” Waititu said. While visiting Ruiru town in October last year, Deputy President William Ruto announced that the government would partner with counties to modernise markets for better business. He said modern facilites would be erected in major markets across the country.
