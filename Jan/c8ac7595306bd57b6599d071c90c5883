The Australian High Commissioner to Kenya Alison Chartres has dismissed media reports that one of their citizens was killed in Tuesday's Dusit terrorist attack. A local daily had reported that the Australian national, Marcus Rodriguez, 36, had jetted into the country on Sunday, January 13 to meet his girlfriend Esylovians Meli.

Meli, who is a Kenyatta University student, was seen giving interviews to a number of media houses at the Chiromo funeral parlour on Wednesday, where families and friends whose loved ones had perished during the attack were camped. But the Australian diplomat dispelled the assertion that one of their nationals perished saying that the said Rodriguez was not a citizen of her country. "I can confirm that an individual reported by some media as an Australian victim of the attack on the DusitD2 hotel complex was not an Australian citizen," she tweeted, responding to a Star journalist who had sought clarification on the matter.
