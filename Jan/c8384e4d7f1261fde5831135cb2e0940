United State ambassador to Kenya Robert Godec on Thursday dispelled speculations on social media that the US government had prior intelligence on the DusitD2 terrorist attacks. In a statement, the ambassador, whose term expires at the end of this month, also said his government did not advise American citizens to avoid the hotel complex. The attack claimed 21 lives and led to scores of others injured. "Contrary to the false reports of social media, the United States had no advance notice of the attack nor did we advise our citizens or staff to avoid the DusitD2 prior to the attack," Godec said. There have been several theories spread mostly across social media on what might have preceded the attack. But the envoy expressed his disgust at theÂ rumours, saying that spreading them "only serve to hamper the ongoing efforts to defeat terrorism." Al Shabaab insurgents have claimed responsibility for the Tuesday attack, saying the assault was in response to US's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
