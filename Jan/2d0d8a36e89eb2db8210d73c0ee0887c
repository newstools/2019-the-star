 Three people were on Monday arraigned in a Nyeri court in connection with the Riverside terror attack in Nairobi. Abdul Kibiringi, James Mwai and Habiba Hunshur appeared before resident magistrate Nelly Kariuki. Police requested for more time to conclude investigations and the three will now spend five days in police custody for further interrogations after the request was granted. Constable Newton Mwangi from the Anti-Terror Police Unit told the court that investigators are yet to obtain their call logs data from telecommunication network providers. The court heard that ATPU detectives wanted the five days considering the nature of the alleged offence. They were arrested on Friday last week with Mwangi claiming that initial investigations indicate that the suspects have a link with other suspects in the attack at Dusit hotel. "Police are waiting for call logs data to finalise the investigations," Mwangi said. Kibiringi who is one of the suspects asked why he was being arrested and charged with the offence claiming that his son was the suspect but not him. The magistrate ordered that the suspects be produced in court on Friday this week. Click here for the latest political news
