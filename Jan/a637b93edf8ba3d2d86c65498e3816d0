An Eldoret woman wants the body of her daughter exhumed for thorough investigations into her sudden death on December 11. Martha Osinde has said she suspects that her daughter, Veronica Kemunto, was murdered. She wants a postmortem carried out by an independent pathologist. She has sought a court order under a certificate of urgency. Kemunto was a teacher at Kandie Primary School in Eldoret town. She died last December and was buried on December 21. Osinde has rejected a postmortem report by a Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital pathologist that said her daughter died from acute cardiac arrest. “I highly doubt the results of that postmortem and demand that a fresh one be done after the body is exhumed,” she said. Osinde says in her suit papers that Kemunto was found dead at her home in mysterious circumstances. She accuses her son-in-law, Elijah Oginda, of failing to report the death to police for investigations. “My family members were assaulted and prevented from attending the burial of my daughter,” the mother said. Oginda has opposed exhumation. He has filed a response through lawyer Dennis Magare. “It’s unwarranted and unnecessary for her to demand that the body be exhumed almost a month after burial,” he says. He says the postmortem from MTRH was sufficient to confirm the possible cause of the death of his wife. “The allegations brought in court to support exhumation are untrue and meant to paint me as a murderer,” Oginda says. He dismissed claims that his wife died at home. Kemunto died in hospital, he says. “I’m satisfied with the postmortem results, which indicate that my wife died from sudden cardiac arrest,” Oginda argues. He also rejected claims that his in-laws were assaulted and blocked from attending the burial. Senior principal magistrate Harrison Barasa is expected to make a ruling today.
