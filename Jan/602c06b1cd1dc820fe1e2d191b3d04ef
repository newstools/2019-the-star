Fifth-seed Albert Njogu cruised into the quarterfinals of the ITF World Tennis Tour with an easy 6-0, 6-2 win over Aly Shokeir of Egypt at the Nairobi Club yesterday. Njogu was in superb form from the start as he demolished the Egyptian in the first set, breaking his serve as early as the second game to win the opener. Shokeir rallied in the second set and broke Njogu’s serve to lead 2-0. Njogu corrected his mistakes and managed to win the third and fourth games of the set to tie the match at 2-2. From then on, Njogu dictated play with crisp serves and back hands return to march into the last eight. Njogu had earlier seen off the challenge of Italy’s Gianni Biagianti 2-6, 7-5, 7-5 in the second round on Tuesday.  He described the match as one of the toughest he had played in recent times but is happy to have held his nerve. “It was tough match and bodes well for me for the later rounds of the tournament,” he added. Ryan Randiek lost 6-2, 6-2 to Hungary’s Benadek Herman. Jayson Mbogoro lost to top seed Abdoul Shakour of Burundi 6-0, 6-3 while Rosehilda Asumwa bowed out of the women’s category after losing to third seed of Egypt’s Sara El Ghazouly 6-2, 6-0.
