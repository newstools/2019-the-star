A police officer was charged in a Mandera court yesterday with killing a watchman. Richard Karanja of the Rapid Deployment Unit was also charged with escaping from police custody. He allegedly killed Takbeer petrol station guard Abdille Abdi on December 8 in Mandera town. Karanja pleaded not guilty to both charges. He appeared before senior resident magistrate Peter Areri. The court heard that Karanja committed the first offence on December 13. During the arraignment, defence lawyer Charles Mwangi requested the court to release his client on bond. The prosecution objected. Senior prosecution counsel Allen Mulama objected, saying Karanja would interfere with the case. Mulama said Karanja was to be arraigned on December 14 but escaped from police cell a day before. “He can’t be released to walk freely in town when he escaped unlawfully from custody,” he said. Karanja is being held at a local prison. He will appear in court on January 18 for a bond ruling. Abdi’s murder caused a public uproar in the town and environs. Last week, local leaders urged security agencies to swiftly bring culprits to book. MCAs Mohamed Ibrahim (Guticha), Aden Abdullahi (Mandera Township), Abdi Aden (Neboi) and Jamale Hassan (Guba) said preliminary investigations showed the killers appeared to be in police uniforms.
