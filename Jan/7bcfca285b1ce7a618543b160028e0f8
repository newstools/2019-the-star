Two doctors have gone to court seeking to suspend an order allowing DCI to confiscate some of their documents and computers. DCI obtained the order requiring Dr Umesh Saini and Mina Saini to produce books of account, invoices and claims for payment of NHIF from 2013 to date. The DCI sought the order to enable it to investigate allegations of misappropriation of funds at NHIF. The order allows detectives to take away computers or any electronic gadget relevant to their probe. It was given on October 31, 2018, by the chief magistrate court. While applying for the order, the DCI informed the court that it was investigating misappropriation of funds at NHIF and sought for permission to search Nairobi West Hospital and private residences of the doctors. But the doctors argue that the DCI never served them with the orders. They also contend that they are neither employees of Nairobi West hospital neither are they employees of NHIF and as such, they have no access to any book of accounts.
