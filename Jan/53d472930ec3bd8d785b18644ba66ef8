The fifth leg of the Safari Tour tees off tomorrow at the Muthaiga Golf Club with players jostling for not only points but the prizes on offer. A day after Johnnie Walker and Barclays Bank joined the fray prompting the tripling of the cash prizes, the former have returned with a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue Label whiskey to be contested for as the hole-in-one prize at the Par-3, 13th hole. East Africa Breweries’ Graham Villiers-Tuthill said: “Johnnie Walker is pleased to announce sponsorship of the Hole-In-one Prize during the Muthaiga leg of the 2018/19 Safari Tour. The first player who holes out in one during the competition will walk away with a prized bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue Label.” Meanwhile, home player Kopan Timbe will be seeking his maiden win at the 5th leg of Safari Tour Golf tournament set for this weekend at the par 71 Muthaiga Golf Club. Timbe, who has played in all four legs since the tour started at Nyali said he is sharpening his skills at Railways Golf club ahead of the tournament. Timbe, who has not won at title will be using the event as part of preparations for this year’s Kenya Open Golf championships at Karen Golf club in March. “I started training on Monday at Kenya railways club hoping to win the title, the first one in the series,” said Timbe. He finished third at the opening series in Nyali, missing the final cut at Limuru, Vet Lab and Thika Greens and hopes to have an excellent swing come Sunday when the professional golfers take to the greens. “I know the course very well and it may not cause many challenges unlike the other,” added Timbe. With two wins from four meetings, Greg Snow leads the table with 77.5 points ahead of Mumias’ Dismas Indiza (75.5 points) as C.A Wangai completes the podium with 55 points. Snow won at the Thika Greens in December, Limuru in September and finished second behind David Wakhu at Nyali while Michael Karanga won the Vet Lab meeting.
