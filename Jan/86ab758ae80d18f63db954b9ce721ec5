Maize and its purchase remain contentious issues between the government and farmers, more so in parts of the Rift Valley where it is the main crop. Year in, year out the two never agree on the price. Today, the National Cereals and Produce Board opens its stores to start selling 1.7 million bags to millers to create space for fresh stock. The board will open more than 15 centres in high-production areas, including Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia and Nandi counties. The move follows President Uhuru Kenyatta's directive on Friday that the board starts buying maize from farmers at Sh2,500 per bag. We hope that unlike last year, ghost and briefcase farmers will not fill the stores and rake in millions at the expense of genuine farmers. In the long-term, the maize sector must be fully liberalised and left to the forces of supply and demand. NCPB should source its strategic reserves in a free market and on a need basis and not succumb to political pressure. There is no price intervention for other key agricultural commodities in the country and the same should apply to maize.
