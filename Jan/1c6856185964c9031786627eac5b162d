A mother of six is fighting for her life in hospital after her husband chopped off her three fingers and inflicted deep panga wounds on the head, back and arms. Monica Atieno is admitted to Migori Referral Hospital. Her husband, 48-year-old Maurice Otieno is on the run. “We have been staying away from each other for the past two years but he called me home for reconciliation,” Atieno said. She returned to her matrimonial home in Rapogi on Sunday from Migori town where she was staying with her children in a rented house. Her elder daughter, Esther Otieno, said they refused to go back home for fear their father would beat them up. “It took only four days for us to get this bad news,” Esther said referring to her mother’s injuries. Otieno attacked his wife at night. Uriri police boss Benjamin Mwanzia said he pretended to have reconciled with the woman only to attack her when she was asleep. “It was at about 1am when he attacked the woman with a panga. She unsuccessfully called for help,” Mwanzia said. The police have launched a a manhunt for the estranged husband.
