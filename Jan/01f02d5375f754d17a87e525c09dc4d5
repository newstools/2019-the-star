The Judiciary has said London-based Queen's Counsel Prof Khawar Qureshi has complied with all requirements needed for him to be given a practising certificate. In a letter dated January 14, Chief Registrar of the Judiciary Anne Amadi said, "We confirm that currently, there is no other compliance required on the part of Prof Khawar Qureshi in regard to issuance of a practising certificate. She was responding to a letter by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions dated January 9. The DPP was notifying the CRJ of a special license issued to the Queens Counsel by the Attorney General pursuant to his appointment. Qureshi paid Sh400 admission fee as required under the Advocates Act before being allowed to prosecute Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu’s case. But his appointment has been met with a lot of resistance. Lawyers representing Mwilu led by Siaya Senator James Orengo want him out. The court will on Thursday determine whether he will lead the prosecution's team in Mwilu’s fraud case.
