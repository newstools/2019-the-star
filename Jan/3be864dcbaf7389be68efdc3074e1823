Director general Fazul Mahamad of the Private Security Regulatory Authority has said that private security guards will be allowed to carry guns. Security companies and guards will have to be vetted and licensed before being armed. This move is long overdue. One reason crime is rampant in Kenya is that only the police and criminals have guns. Thieves can safely attack a house because the security guard will only have a rungu or bow and arrow. It is a false assumption that more weapons will mean more crime. If private security guards at offices, banks and dwellings are armed, it will make it much more difficult for armed gangs to break in. However guards should not be armed with assault rifles like AK-47s firing bullets that can kill for up to a kilometre. They should only be allowed to carry shotguns, which are deadly at close range but which have little effect after 50 metres. Then there will be minimal risk of collateral damage if private security guards get into a firefight with robbers.
