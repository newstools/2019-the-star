Two women were on Thursday arrested by public health officers and taken
to Meru police station for allegedly storing faeces in buckets inside
their houses and later pouring it in a river. Njue Gitonga,Â  who lives in Mjini slums, and is their neighbour, said he met one
of the women carrying a bucket and when he inquired about the contents, she refused to say what they were. "I was
shocked to see that he was carrying faeces. I called the area chief who
was shocked and he told me to guard the suspect as he called public
health officers," Gitonga said. Amina Mukami said has a running stomach and cannot hold until she relieves herself outside. "I wanted to get out but I could not hold much longer," she said. The two are being held by police at Meru police station. Click here for the latest political news
