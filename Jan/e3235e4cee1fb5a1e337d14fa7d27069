Kabras coach Hennie Du Plessis has set his sights on having the Kenya Cup final played in Kakamega come the end of the season. The sugar millers are the only unbeaten side in the top flight with 35 points after seven matches and the South African tactician thinks a final at home will be ideal. “Ultimately, we are looking at finishing the league phase in first position and to host the final at our backyard,” added Du Plessis. He said the side has room for improvement despite a 100 percent start to the season . The tactician cited the 41-5 win over Nondies last weekend, where the Kabras led 41-0 at the break but never scored any points in the second half. “We have to improve our execution in the second half and the boys can’t afford to relax. I think it’s one area we can get better as the season goes along,” he added. Du Plessis said the side was cautious and taking a game at a time. “We are in a good position but it’s a long season and our approach is to take one game at a time,” he added. Kabras face a resurgent Mwamba side at the Kakamega show ground tomorrow and Du Plessis expects a tough test from them. “Mwamba have been playing well and we know what they bring on the table. We must be ready for what will be a competitive game against them,” he noted. Du Plessis said the side will have a one week break following the Mwamba game tomorrow to prepare for the mouth-watering clash against Quins on February 9 at the RFUEA ground. “I will give the boys time off next weekend because we are not involved in the Enterprise Cup and it will be good for them to recharge the batteries for the reminder of the season,” he added. Kabras have played the in the Kenya Cup final since being promoted to the top tier, winning in 2016 against Impala 22-5 but losing the 2015, 2017 and 2018 finals to KCB.
