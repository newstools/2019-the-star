Inspector General of
Police Joseph Boinnet yesterday revealed that the government has
recruited 11,000 police reservists. In a press statement
yesterday, Boinnet said the recruitment of police reservists who
operate in North Eastern and Rift Valley region was not linked to
politics. Boinnet was reacting to
a story published in the Star yesterday . The story raised alarm, both in police echelons and Rift Valley, where majority of the
reservists are based after 350 guns that were meant for use by the
reservists were intercepted in Nakuru. The guns were
intercepted following orders by DIG incharge of Kenya police, Edward
Mbugua on New Year's eve. The statement was
issued by police spokesman Owino Waho'ngo. The police chief did
not address issues raised in the story that the arming of the police
reservist was going on despite an order by the Interior Ministry to
stop registration of police reservist and the issuance of weapons. Highly placed sources
told the Star , the Interior ministry through official Amos Gathecha
had directed the police to stop the recruitment of reservists until
an audit of their numbers , their stations and guns issued to them is
concluded. The IG did not also
address the issue of why the weapons in Nakuru had been detained even
as he insisted that the police were not engaged arming the reservists secretary. Click here for
