France has extradited to The Hague a senior football official wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes committed in the Central African Republic (CAR). Patrice-Edouard Ngaïssona, a committee member of the Confederation of African Football, was arrested in Paris last month accused of coordinating attacks on Muslims in his country. He was the self-declared political co-ordinator of the Christian anti-Balaka militia, which was created after mainly Muslim Seleka rebels swept President Francois Bozize from power in 2013. The militia has been blamed for hundreds of killings, and the ICC says Mr Ngaïssona was responsible for murder, torture and the recruitment of child soldiers. He denies the allegations.
