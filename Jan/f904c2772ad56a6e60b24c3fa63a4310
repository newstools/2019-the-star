Former Kenya Sevens strength and conditioning coach Geoffrey Kimani has been appointed Uganda Sevens strength and conditioning coach. This will be his second spell with the Cranes, having served in the same capacity in the 2016-2017 season. Kimani’s target is to ensure Uganda qualifies for the 2019/2020 World Sevens Series as well as the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Kimani had a long stint with Kenya Sevens between 2008 and 2016, working with several coaches including Benjamin Ayimba, Mike Friday, Paul Treu and Innocent Simiyu in that order. Kimani had been appointed in the same capacity as Kenya Sevens coach for this season but declined and opted to take a sabbatical to concentrate on athletics. Elsewhere, Impala Saracens head coach Frank Ndong has admitted that they cannot afford any more losses if they are to make the Kenya Cup playoffs at the end of the season. The Sarries suffered their fourth consecutive loss over the weekend, going down 37-24 to Quins in the Ngong Road derby and the tactician reckons that they must win the remaining eight games to qualify for playoff. “We are currently in seventh place with 20 points with the league at the halfway stage. Going forward ,we have to win eight out of eight to be in the playoffs and probably get a higher seeding,” added Ndong. The Ngong-Road outfit have lost to Kabras 41-10, Nondies 22-20 and Mwamba 20-16 The tactician said they haven’t given up hope yet and are confident of making it to the playoffs. “There is still a long way to go and our team will get better in the weeks to come,” he added. Ndong said the side has go back to the drawing and do the basics right. “If you look at emerging pattern, we have had very slow starts and failed to basics right in attack and defence. So it’s something we have to get right ahead of our next game against Menengai Oilers in a fortnight.”
