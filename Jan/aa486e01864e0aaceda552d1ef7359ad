Kikuyu Council of Elders has not declared its support for anyone for the presidency in 2022, the group declared on Monday. “We as the Kikuyu Council of Elders have never sat down with anyone and came up with a preferred candidate. But what we are saying here is that every Kenyan has a right to vie for the presidency,” he said. The council’s chairman Wachira Kiago said the elders will instead visit all other community elders countrywide for consultation. This, he said at Kabiruini ASK showground in Nyeri town, will enable them come up with the best candidate for the country. He was responding to claims that the Kikuyu elders had struck a deal with their Kalenjin counterparts to support Ruto in 2022. This comes after Jubilee Party vice- chairman David Murathe said there is no MoU with Deputy President William Ruto, and that he should retire with the President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022. This has triggered debate and disagreements among Jubilee Party members. The elders, however, said it is too early to engage in 2022 campaigns, and called on politicians to first serve Kenyans before engaging in succession politics. Kiago said too much politics at this time will only divide Kenyans. He said Kenyans should vote for the best leaders, not based on their ethnic communities. Kenyans, he said, should look for a performer come 2022 who will serve them and uplift their living standards. The leaders also said they will support a referendum if it will help end ethnic animosity and the subsequent repeated ethnic violence after every election year and ensure equal distribution of resources in the country. The elders had converged at the grounds for an annual end of year prayers. Kiago called on all leaders to unite and work together. Among those present were Nyeri governor Mutahi Kahiga, Speaker John Kaguchia, Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu his Kiambaa counterpart Paul Koinange and former transport CS Michael Kamau, among others.
