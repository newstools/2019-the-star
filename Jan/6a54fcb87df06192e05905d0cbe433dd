Mandera county has allocated Sh43 million this financial year to boost vocational training centres. A total of Sh32 million will be used to improve the infrastructure in vocational training centres and 11 million for the operations. Governor Ali Roba disclosed this yesterday when he presided over the graduation ceremony of 169 trainees at the Mandera Vocational Training Centre in Mandera town. He said his administration has allocated more resources in terms of personnel, capital as well as infrastructure to develop and sustain vocational training centres. He challenged residents to enrol and acquire skills that will not only be helpful to them but to the county. “As a region we still have shortage of skilled man power. I want to appeal to our people to take this opportunity to enrol our children in this technical institutions,” Roba said. He said the region would only make meaningful development by tapping into the relevant training and skills that will be acquired by the graduands. Roba thanked development partners whom he said have played a big part in supporting vocational training centres across the county.
