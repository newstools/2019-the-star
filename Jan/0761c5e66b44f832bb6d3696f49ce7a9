The University of Nairobi is willing to partner with Nyeri county to improve employee performance. Planning registrar David Njuguna (pictured) on Saturday said their work would involve asssessing skills and county needs to identify gaps that hurt its operations. The county wants to know if it has effectively been meeting its performance needs. “That was an area we felt we can collaborate on through short courses targeting those working within the county government,” Njuguna said. He spoke during a regional open day in Nyeri town. Njuguna said they will ensure employees do not leave for training outside the county. Those interested can do so internally, he said. UoN officials also met county secretary Benjamin Gachichio and other senior staff. “We agreed that there would be a need for an MoU or agreement between the University of Nairobi and the county on the areas of collaboration,” Njuguna said.
