Baringo woman representative Gladwell Cheruiyot wants Jubilee leaders to stop inciting the public over 2022 succession politics. The MP who attended the training of beekeeping farmers at Kapkuikui in Baringo South on Friday, said it is only God who knows those who will form the next government and lead the country. “We are having no peace working for our electorates as a majority of the youths are focused on 2022 politics,” Cheruiyot said. She cited the incident when she with her fellow Kanu supporters were booed during the Kimalel goat auction in Baringo South subcounty graced by Deputy President William Ruto on December 22, 2018. Among the Jubilee leaders present during the annual goat auction were Elgeyo-Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, Uasin-Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, Soy MP Caleb Kositany and Kimani Ichungwa(Kikuyu). They were hosted by Baringo Governor Stanely Kiptis, Speaker David Kiplagat, Baringo North MP William Cheptumo and former Tiaty MP Asman Kamama. Cheruiyot said the county is grappling with challenges of insecurity, water shortage, poor health and quality education which she blamed on divisive party politics. “We must know that our people do not eat parties. It is the work of their hands supported by their leaders that serve to improve their economy and this can only work if outsiders stop their frequent malicious visits,” she said. The MP said her people trusted and elected her on a Kanu ticket and it was time for people to shelve politics until 2022. During a football tournament in Kabarnet town in December last year, Cheruiyot with Tiaty MP William Kamket were heckled by the public for drumming up support for Baringo Senator Gideon Moi. Cheruiyot hinted that all parties in Kenya were 'born' from Kanu and they would 'return home' at some point in time. Click here for the latest political news
