Celebrated media personality Adelle Onyango is making moves again in 2019. She has received a nomination to the Zuri Awards. Zuri Awards was established in 2017. It celebrates women and organisations bringing change through their work in their community. "It’s humbling and an unexpected validation not only for me but the entire team behind the Adelle Onyango Initiative and our partners who believed in us when no one else did," Adelle told Word Is yesterday. In December last year, the Kiss FM presenter launched an initiative known as 'Unapologetically African'. Thus the nomination comes as a celebration of those who have directly or indirectly been impacted by the initiative’s programmes. "It’s really not about just me," she said. This year, the Adelle Onyango Initiative has big plans. "We plan to continue our Scholarship and Job Shadow programmes that commenced in 2017 and 2018 respectively," she said. "We are also adding our skills-based workshops to supplement the other two programmes, and will be able to accommodate more people." The initiative will also influence change through storytelling and conversations. All this, she said, is run on the foundation of being unapologetically African, and this means telling true stories, so a lot of thought-provoking stories are on the way.
