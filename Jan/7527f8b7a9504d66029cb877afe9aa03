Kikuyu elders yesterday rebuked politicians from Mt Kenya region for disrespecting President Uhuru Kenyatta. The Kikuyu Cultural Elders Association commonly known as Kiama Kiama warned that the 2022 succession politics was hurting the economy and jeopardising development and cohesion agenda. “We are very concerned, especially when we see our political leaders who are from our community going to the street to raise issues,” chairman Ndungu Gaithuma said. Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria and Bahati’s Kimani Ngunjiri have publicly bashed Uhuru. They claimed his administration has not initiated development in Mt Kenya despite the region having overwhelmingly voted for him in 2013 and 2017 polls. But the elders said it was in “bad taste for the MPs to utter remarks that serve to demean the Presidency and the President. “We implore all leaders and Kenyans to respect institutions, particularly the President and the Presidency as a symbol of national unity,” they said.
