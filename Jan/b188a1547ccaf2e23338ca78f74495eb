A 25-year-old woman yesterday denied defiling a boy, 15, at the Riruta police station. She begged instead to be charged with a murder case under investigations, which she wants to confess. Naomi Sanya was charged with defiling the boy on January 23 at 8pm inside the cells,where she was detained. She was also charged with committing an indecent act with a minor. Police had obtained 15 days custodial orders to probe a murder case and placed her in the cells. The boy had been arrested the same day for being in possession of bhang. But Sanya allegedly lured him into her cell, undressed and defiled him. Yesterday she pleaded with senior principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot to charge her with the murder, which she said is true. State counsel Kennedy Panyako opposed that she be released on bond or bail. He said Sanya was in custody over a murder case that is under investigations. Panyako said the complainant is a minor under protection and pleaded for urgency in hearing the matter to allow the boy to testify. Cheruiyot said she must wait for police to conclude investigations. Sanya opposed her continued incarceration. The mechanic trainee, who previously worked with NYS in Malava, told the court she has a breastfeeding 11-month-old baby. The hearing of the defilement case is tomorrow.
