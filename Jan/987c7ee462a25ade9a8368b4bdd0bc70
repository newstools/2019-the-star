A youth who promotes patriotism through his drawings wants to meet President Uhuru Kenyatta. Collins Obado, 28, was arrested on December 31 for causing a disturbance after standing in the middle of the road as Uhuru's convoy passed on the way to State House, Mombasa. The President was going to deliver the New Year message. Obado carried his drawing of the handshake between Uhuru and ODM leader Raila Odinga to show the President. The picture bore a message, “The golden handshake. Amani, umoja, upendo na ushirikiano [peace, unity, love and cooperation].” Obado was arraigned on Wednesday but released unconditionally by Mombasa senior resident magistrate Erick Mutunga. The first born in a family of five, Obado said relatives look up to him to provide even though he is unemployed. He comes from Siaya, but lives in Mtwapa. "When the President said he will commission Mtongwe Ferry, I drew the vessel to give it to him," he said. The launch of resumption of Mtongwe services was on March 2017. "When he said the SGR will be operational, I drew the train. I have travelled on it," Obado said. He aspires to join the Kenya Defence Forces. "Besides meeting the President, joining the forces will be a dream come true," Obado said. Click here for the latest political news
