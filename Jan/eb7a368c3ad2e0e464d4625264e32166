Kenya Airways is offering a 30 per cent discount on its economy class tickets to celebrate its 42nd birthday on Tuesday. Customers can as well buy a Business Class ticket and get the second one free in the promotional campaign offer. The airline said on Tuesday via Twitter, that the promotion will apply to customers who will book and pay by February 5, 2019, and travel by December 10, 2019. "The fare offer is valid on selected destination across its network," the airline added. Tickets can be booked at any KQ sales offices, from preferred travel agents or online. The ticket will sell at Sh 3,900 one way and not the regular price of Sh5,500. The Kisumu to Nairobi route one-way ticket will sell at Sh3,400 instead Sh4,900. The offer extends internationally, with the one-way ticket en route from Dubai to Nairobi and vice versa going for Sh13,800 and not the regular cost of Sh18,900. Kenya Airways flies to 52 destinations worldwide, 42 of which are in Africa and carries over three million passengers annually. The national carrier made history last year in October with its debut Nairobi-New York nonstop flight. The 15-hour nonstop flight covers a distance of more than 13,713km and is the first commercially scheduled non-stop service between Kenya and the US. The flight ranks as one of the longest flights in the world at seventh place. Read more on this on:Kenya Airways makes history, dreamliner lands in New York
