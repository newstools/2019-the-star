A family whot lost an 18-year-old girl to kidney failure last year has donated a dialysis machine to Murang’a Level 5 hospital. The machine will make it possible for more renal patients to access dialysis. The renal unit was started in 2015 by the county with four machines and the national government which added five more in 2016. George and Lucy Kihara donated one dialysis machine in partnership with Consolata Shrine fraternity to the renal unit that has now been named after their daughter Christine Wambui. Governor Mwangi Wa Iria, while receiving the machine, said he was prompted to start the unit after he met Wambui as she sought medical care during the 2013 elections. The unit, he said, has so far conducted 16,224 free dialysis sessions and saved patients over Sh160 million. One session costs Sh9,500 at Kenyatta National Hospital where patients previously had to endure the long queues, many succumbing as they waited, he said. The governor said 42 patients are on chronic dialysis and attend two sessions every week while 42 others are in the waiting list. “I am happy that with the new machines, we will be able to conduct 6 more sessions everyday,” he said.
