The Kenya Urban Roads Authority has ordered traders occupying footpaths on Outering Road to leave or be forcefully evicted. Kura’s directive comes after residents of Umoja One estate complained of encroachment of footpaths and open trenches by traders. Traders and welders block the pedestrians from using the footpaths. Yesterday, Kura chief communication officer John Cheboi told the Star the traders will have to move or be forcefully evicted. “The traders are not supposed to occupy the footpaths. We are aware they were affected when the road was rehabilitated but they are to be compensated and shifted to Kangundo Road market once it is complete,” Cheboi said. He said Kura registered the affected traders to avoid compensating impostors. The residents have also complained about open trenches dug by contractors, saying they were a danger to schoolchildren. Umoja One ward rep Mark Mugambi told the Star yesterday that one big trench is a tragedy in waiting. “The trench is next to a bus stop and right next to business premises. We also have residents walking in and out of the courts. What happens if the rain fills it (trench) up?” he asked. Mugambi urged Kura to fast-track work to prevent a tragedy. The 13km stretch from Taj Mall to GSU headquarters is supposed to have 11 footbridges.
