Limoro villagers within Athwana ward in Tigania West, Meru, are living in fear after hyenas invaded the area and killed several goats. The residents called on the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) to drive out the animals or they will hunt and kill them. Joseph Thuranira said the hyenas and monkeys had caused extensive damage but in spite of protesting, action had not been taken. “On Christmas day we ate only rice in this homestead without meat. But now the hyenas have eaten the meat yet the owner wanted to sell them to raise school fees. KWS must know we are bitter,” Thuranira said. He said residents would no longer stay put and let the hyenas wreck more terror on them. The hyenas in the past few days invaded several homesteads at Limoro and devoured several sheep and goats. The residents are now demanding compensation over the losses from the hyenas, suspected to come from the Meru National Park or other neighboring animal sanctuaries. Beauty Gitonga said she was woken at 3am by a neighbor alerting her hyenas were on the prowl in the area and it was dangerous to venture out.
