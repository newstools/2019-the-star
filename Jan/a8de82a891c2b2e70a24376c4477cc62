Two Jubilee lawmakers yesterday traded blames on social media in a move that shows the need for President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to tame their allies. Nyeri MP Wambugu Ngunjiri and Nandi senator Samson Cherargei engaged in bitter exchanges over the 2007 post election violence in connection to succession politics. The two trade blames on who between the Kalenjins and Kikuyu’s was responsible for the violence in which more than 1000 people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced from their homes.

We know you and your ilk who you are their face .No one owes anyone anything so stop your imagination,” Cherargei wrote on his Facebook page. “You still smell ODM where. We understand where you come from. Utajua haujui,” he wrote. In his response, Wambugu said despite the leadership of Rift Valley promising in 2013 “never again” will election-related violence arise in Kenya, Rift Valley leaders were teasing members of the Kikuyu community in the region to vote for Ruto in 2022. “The associates of the leaders from Rift Valley who left ODM are the ones fear-mongering and beating the drums of war about possible violence, again in Rift Valley, if they lose in 2022,” Wambugu said.
