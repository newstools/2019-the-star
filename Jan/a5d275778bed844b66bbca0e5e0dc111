Amani National Congress party has called for a full disclosure of measures being taken in preparation for this year’s census for its credibility’s sake. Party leader Musalia Mudavadi on Monday said the census is key to economic planning and development and the electoral process. “This country has had issues with the manner in which census is conducted and the results,” Mudavadi said. He spoke in Mombasa. The former deputy Prime Minister said the last census in 2009 was flawed and called for utmost integrity and transparency. He said the planning department was forced to nullify the 2009 census results in eight districts because of inconsistencies. As a result, more than a million people were not factored in the estimated figure. “This has a significant bearing on elections because a rigged census will continue to perpetuate the economic and political injustices,” he said. He called on the department to inform Kenyans on all the steps it is taking to ensure the exercise if free and fair. He said the technology that will be used in the exercise should be disclosed. “Census results have a direct bearing on impending boundary reviews and the next elections,” Mudavadi said. The last boundaries review was done eight years ago and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission is planning another review. “If the census were to be rigged again, then automatically the electoral boundaries and the equality of the vote will be offended, and subsequent elections shall be rigged,” he said.
