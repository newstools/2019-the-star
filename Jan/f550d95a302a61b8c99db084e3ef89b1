"Any street children found loitering in Lodwar town, will be arrested together with their parents or guardian. We need to take our children to school, some of street children here in Lodwar have their parents and guardians who are running away from the responsibilities," Motivo said. Motivo said they are carrying an operation in Turkana to make sure all children report to their respective schools.
