The Council of Governors will hold elections for the chairperson, vice-chairperson and whip on January 14. Chairman Josephat Nanok on Tuesday sent a goodwill message for the New Year and gave the council's calendar of events for the first quarter. In July last year, it was expected that Nanok would step down for his Kwale counterpart Salim Mvurya. Nanok succeeded former Meru governor Peter Munya in May 2017, and his term was to end mid last year. There were media reports that he had declined to step down. However, he dismissed the claims.

He said a children's conference will be from February 18 to 20 at Nairobi Primary School as a precursor for the devolution conference to be hosted by Kirinyaga county. The sixth devolution conference is set to run from March 4 to 8 at Kirinyaga University. The council has also urged fidelity to the Constitution and peaceful coexistence among Kenyans in the new year. Click here for the latest political news
