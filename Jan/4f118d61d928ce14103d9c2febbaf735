Singer Akothee has reminisced on her past life, when she was broke. In a tearful video posted online, she looks back at her life and she cannot believe how far God has brought her. "I do not know why God didn’t let me know that one day I will be successful and have everything," she says. "Like I taking strong tea now by choice but some people are taking it because they cannot afford milk. When I had just given birth to a baby, I was hungry and with nothing to drink. I really wanted to make soup, but you know you can’t get soup from vegetable." Akothee is one of the richest artistes in Kenya, according to how she flaunts her wealth on social media.
