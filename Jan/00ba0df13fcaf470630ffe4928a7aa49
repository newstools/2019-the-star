Kenya's corruption index has worsened despite spirited efforts to prosecute graft suspects. A new report by Transparency International shows the country scored 27 per cent, a one per cent decrease from last year's score. The global Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) report was released yesterday. TI executive director Samuel Kimeu blamed the executive for protecting corruption suspects. The report said the corrupt operate with impunity and use their positions, with the help of the state, to encroach on the freedom and democracy of Kenyans.

TI said key institutions in the anti-corruption war face challenges in delivering their mandate because of a pervading culture of impunity among the political and economic elite. “In the past five years, Kenya’s score has ranged between 25 and 28 per cent," TI chair Delia Rubio said. The country scored 26 per cent in 2016 and 25 per cent in both 2015 and 2014. Read: Corruption worsens in Kenya despite Uhuru's vigor to end vice - TI Click here for the latest political news
