United States International University ‘A’ Spartans’ coach Willis Okeyo has promised to break Telkom’s dominance in the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) women’s Premier League in the forthcoming season, which starts on March 2. Okeyo is banking on the experience his playing unit gained from their debut at the just concluded Africa Cup of Club Championship in Nigeria last month, where they finished fourth. Telkom, who also doubles up as the African champions have proved peerless locally winning the league without testing defeat in a number of seasons— a norm which Okeyo has vowed to break next season. Telkom have encountered rivalry from Spartans and Strathmore University Scorpions in the recent years albeit minimum. This has not, however, stopped them from winning the league 20 times and shifting the focus to defend it without conceding a goal rather than just keeping it. However, Okeyo feels that it will not be business as usual as her charges have come of age and will do everything within their means to be crowned the new champions. “Telkom should brace themselves up for a runners up finish in the next season as we will be going for the title. We have learnt our mistakes from the previous seasons and this time round we want to get it right from the first match. We picked vital lessons and confidence from Nigeria which I believe will play a crucial role in our quest to dethrone Telkom. It is possible and I hope the players will replicate the tactical lessons drawn from the continental tournament in the league and focus on achieving our target.” The youthful coach who turns out for former men’s champions Kenya Police revealed plans of beefing up[ his squad by roping in a unspecified number of new players to meet the depth and competition demands of the top flight. “We are negotiations with a number of new players whom we intend to add in our side. We need depth and competition in all departments which I believe will aid in achieving our goal.”
