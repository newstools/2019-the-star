Four people died and 11 others sustained injuries after a 14-seater matatu and lorry collided at Kiriani near the notorious Nithi bridge on Friday evening. Maara sub county OCPD Johnston Kabusia said two people died on the spot while two others were pronounced dead on arrival at the Chogoria Mission hospital. Their bodies were taken to the hospital mortuary. According to an eye-witness, John Mutugi, the driver of the lorry that was ferrying building blocks from Meru town to Chuka town hit the matatu that was ferrying ten people from Nairobi. “The Nissan driver had tried to avoid the lorry that seemed to have some mechanical problems but unfortunately it followed them hitting his vehicle from behind,” said Mutugi.

The OCPD said most of the injured have multiple fractures on the legs and hands and tissue injuries. “I urge drivers to be careful while on this road because it has very sharp turns,” said Kabusia. The residents said they have witnessed more than ten fatal accidents on the stretch between the notorious Nithi bridge and Chogoria town and urged the government to erect bumps to reduce speeding of vehicles.
