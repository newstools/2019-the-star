Meru governor Kiraitu Murungi has said he will not respond to those insulting him or criticising his administration. He said leaders should concentrate on their development agenda, not insults. “2019 is the year of handshake and I will go the extra mile to promote unity among leaders. I will repay hatred with love. As the Bible says, if someone takes your shirt give him the coat,” Kiraitu said. He spoke on Friday during a farewell party for former Meru county commissioner who was promoted to Central regional commissioner. Kiraitu said residents will not remember insults, but development. “Even if they call me a dog or a snake, I will not respond,” he said. A week ago, EALA MP Mpuru Aburi said he regretted campaigning against Trade CS Peter Munya in the Meru governor’s race. Aburi was a fierce critic of Munya. He said he persuaded Kiraitu to run for the county’s top job in 2017. “I proposed the plan to him in 2015 but he declined. In 2016, he agreed and I went around the county campaigning for him,” the MP said. Aburi said Imenti people should forgive him for misleading them into electing Kiraitu. Aburi said they brought down a “proud tortoise from a tree” and now they have have “a leopard on the tree”.
