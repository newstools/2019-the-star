Former Embakasi East MP John Ogutu Omondi wants the Nyumba Kumi Initiative to have legal backing boost the fight against terrorism. He said the idea of each tenant knowing at least 10 fellow tenants has not been effective. Omondi said he is drafting a bill seeking to legalise Nyumba Kumi that will be tabled in Parliament. The bill proposes that all estates in Kenya adopt the Nyumba Kumi Initiative. Omondi said he came up with the bill after learning that one terrorist, who attacked the DusitD2 hotel complex had rented a house in Ruaka. The former MP spoke on Monday while addressing staff of Trade Winds Aviation at JKIA. He said all landlords should be compelled to ask tenants to produce copies of all their identification documents. Omondi said the bill seeks to have each subcounty to have a Nyumba Kumi office headed by a chairperson. He said the office should keep a digital register of all landlords and tenants. “Tanzania is serious about Nyumba Kumi. You can’t just walk around if you are a visitor without the authorities knowing. We should ensure this initiative works so that we get to know who the wrong people in society are,” he said. During the Dusit attack, at least 21 people lost their lives. Omondi praised Kenyan security forces for saving hundreds of people at Dusit. Click here for the latest political news
