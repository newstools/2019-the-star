Homa Bay parents on Thursday faulted PSV operators for hiking fares as primary and secondary schools reopened. “The majority of us cannot meet the hiked fare and conduct shopping for students to return to school,” Nicholas Owuor said. Another parent, Pamela Akinyi, said, “Matatu operators are reaping where they did not sow. We’re appealing for intervention from the government." A spot check indicated matatus plying the Homa Bay- Kisumu route were charging Sh700 instead of the usual Sh300. Ken Ouma, a matatu driver, said there was a shortage of PSVs as some were yet to comply with the Michuki rules that were revived in November 2018. “Some PSV owners have not complied with the Michuki laws. They have therefore left their vehicles at hence created the scarcity,” he said. Teachers had threatened to start their strike on Thursday following a disagreement over their CBA. However, the court ordered teachers back to class and restrained the TSC from transferring Knut branch officials pending talks.
