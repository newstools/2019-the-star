Three daughters of billionaire businessman James Mwangi Kirung’o have sued their brothers over the ownership of the family estate worth Sh2 billion. The estate includes Nairobi’s K1 Club House, Kahama Hotels, Small World Country Club, banks, land and houses. The plaintiffs, through lawyer Jeremy Njenga, want the High Court to order that the wealth be divided equally amongst the siblings. The daughters accused their two brothers of excluding them and their mother from the estate. They want the court to compel John Kirungo and Sammy Wakaina to provide the details of all business accounts since March 1998 when their father died. “That pursuant to the grant issued to Eunice Njeri Mwangi on December 7, 1998, the estate be shared out among the deceased’s beneficiaries in equal shares or in such proportions as the beneficiaries may agree upon and in default, the court distributes the estate as it deems just and reasonable,” the lawyer said. The daughters said their father left a will in which their mother Eunice Mwangi was appointed the sole administrator. The will did not share out the property. The daughters - Hannah, Nancy, and Ruth - claim their brothers manipulated their mother and took over the estate. Mwangi is survived by five children and a widow after one of his sons, Stephen Mwaura, died last year. At the centre of the legal tussle is the popular Klub 1 Club House on Ojijo Road Parklands estimated to be worth Sh500 million. The value includes development and the land. The Kahama Hotels in Nairobi and Mombasa are valued at Sh400 million. The family owns a residential house in Parklands and an apartment in Kilimani. Behind the club is a 100-acre farm. Kahama Properties Agencies Ltd owns plots including two next to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Embakasi and another two in Nyahururu. Click here for the latest political news
