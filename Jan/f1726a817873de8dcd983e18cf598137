Mt Kenya leaders who accuse President Uhuru Kenyatta of neglecting their region should recant their “ill and false” statement, Meru governor Kiraitu Murungi said yesterday. Their “grandstanding, opportunistic and rhetoric” sentiments cannot help the region, Kiraitu said as he highlighted several development projects, some complete and others in progress in Meru. The projects have either been commissioned or are to be launched by President Kenyatta or Deputy President William Ruto. The governor urged Mt Kenya leaders to convene an urgent meeting to deliberate on issues bedevilling the region instead of castigating the head of state. “Let us sit down as leaders of Mt Kenya and strategise on how we can mobilise more resources for the development of our counties.” Kiraitu disagreed with those accusing the President of neglecting Mt Kenya region. “Uhuru is trying his best. He cannot do everything alone. He has given Sh900 million for miraa farmers, Sh900 million for construction of Kinoru Stadium to international standards, waived Sh400 million debt of Meru Dairy Cooperative Union,” he said. Other benefits to Meru county that he highlighted are the Sh1 billion funding for sewerage in Meru town, Sh200 million for construction of water intakes and Sh100 million to uplift Meru Town. The President, he further said, is supporting the revival of coffee in the region and has also “given us money to construct dams and water pans and also instructed CS (James) Macharia to fast-track tarmacking of roads in all constituencies in Meru”. The governor was addressing the press at a Meru hotel. He supported the handshake between Uhuru and ODM leader Raila Odinga as it is meant to enhance harmony, peace and development in the country.
