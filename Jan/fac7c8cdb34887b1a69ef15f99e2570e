His lawyer told senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku that Ongwae was away upcountry attending a funeral and only learned from the press that he was under arrest. Mutuku subsequently directed that Ongwae appears in court on January 23 to take plea when the case will be mentioned against him and the other accused persons. It is alleged that in January last year, Ongwae, Eric Chesire, Mburu, Hillary, Ibrahim Twahir and three companies, namely, Gendpie Enterprises, Rupai Trading Limited and Landmark Freight Services Limited conspired to defraud the government of Sh4.3 million. The four allegedly did so by imposing a penalty of 0.5 per cent instead of 15 per cent of the total custom value on imported goods without a certificate of conformity. Ongwae faces another separate charge of abusing his office. It is alleged that between January 25 and 26 last year, he unlawfully authorised the waiver of penalty for imported goods without a certificate of conformity from the country of origin from 15 per cent of the total custom value to 0.5 per cent. Mburu faces another charge of willfully refusing to answer questions by an authorised officer. Read: Former Kebs boss Ongwae to face fresh charges Click here for the latest political news
