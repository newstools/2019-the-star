Hundreds of families are facing famine due to prolonged drought in Marsabit North subcounty. Area Deputy County Commissioner Stephen Kavulu said the residents who are mainly livestock keepers face starvation unless they get food aid without delay. Kavulu said the area had not received rain for nearly a year adding that livestock that 7,544 households depended on could no longer yield milk. Kavulu appealed to the government and donors to come to the aid of the affected families saying that pasture has been depleted while water pans have dried up. “All the nine locations in this subcounty are affected and the residents are in dire need of humanitarian assistance,” he said. The most affected are children, women and the elderly left behind in villages as men roamed the county in search of pasture. Kavulu added that relief food support that comprised 1,000 bags of maize and 6,000 bags of beans donated by the national government in December was not enough given the big number of people in need of help. Action was necessary to avert disruption of activities including school attendance.
