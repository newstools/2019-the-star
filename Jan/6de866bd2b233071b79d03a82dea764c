Garissa employees who fail to perform will be sacked, county secretary Ali Abdi said yesterday. Abdi also warned staff against absconding duty as it is against the code of conduct. The county boss, who was speaking during the closing of a training workshop in Garissa town, said county operations continued even during festive seasons. The training was attended by 40 employees from the departments of trade, tourism, investment and entrepreneurship. Abdi told all workers to stick to the terms of their contracts. “As we start a new year, let us all strive to do things differently,” Abdi said. He called for dedication in service. “We’ll not hesitate to dismiss individuals who are non-performers,” Abdi said. He praised the department of trade and tourism for training staff ahead of the disbursement of Sh150 million revolving fund. He said MCAs will be recalled for a special meeting to approve the names of those appointed to the committee of the fund. The kitty will be officially launched by Governor Ali Korane. Trade and tourism executive Adow Jubat and chief officer Mahat Salah said the department had achieved its targets of building capacity among staff and drafting bills and policies for development. County public service board chairperson Ebla Sahal lauded the department for the training of staff. Sahal said the board will ensure all departments have capacity building trainings to boost skills for efficient services. Former water executive Muktar Burale who is the programme officer for Adesso’s Marifaa Corner said they will partner with the department to explore more local innovations for support.
