ODM has given former MP Chris Karan a direct ticket for the Ugenya by-election. The decision was communicated on Monday by the National Elections Board chairperson Judith Pareno. The communication comes barely a week after aspirant Daniel Juma petitioned ODM officials to conduct nominations. On Tuesday, Juma said he would appeal the decision which came on the last day for presentation on nominees to the IEBC. He said the party communication was not in good faith, adding it ought to have been made earlier. “I think the communication was meant to lock me out of the race and give Karan a window to defend his term,” Juma said. He said he will decide what to do next after meeting ODM party leader Raila Odinga on Wednesday. “The Ugenya people had promised to give me votes even as an individual, but I don’t want to declare my next move before meeting with the party leader,” Juma said. “The ODM party constitution has the rules and the rights of members and I don’t understand why all those were not considered in this case." Juma said the only privilege the party can offer members is to allow them to participate in the elections. The Ugenya parliamentary seat had attracted three aspirants but with the new development, the race might be between David Ochieng of MDG and Karan. Ochieng was also given direct nomination by his party. Addressing the Star on the phone shortly after receiving the go-ahead as the MDG flag bearer in the Ugenya by-elections, Ochieng said his plans to secure the Ugenya seat are already in place.
