Jacque Maribe is back in the limelight after her Citizen TV workmate Hassan Mugambi shared a photo of her hitting the gym. It has been a pretty minute since we spotted her out and about. The last time we heard about any of her future plans was when her pal, Dennis Itumbi penned a poem for her. It read: “Here my hand, Use it as your extra strength, Use it to write your new chapter, Use it to bounce back, Here my hand, Have enough of it for support and strength, Then let it go, There is a reason storms are named after women, You are a storm, yes you are.” And, indeed she is back, stronger than ever. Mugambi captioned the photo: “Do not finish when you are tired, finish when you are done. @kadzoh_gungah @jacquemaribe @dan_lijodi @hakeem_the_fit join the Family @fitfamke.”
