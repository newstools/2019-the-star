Police officers have called for uniform house allowance for respective grades to end corruption in the service. Some officers who spoke to the Star on condition of anonymity yesterday said different allowances will cause unfair transfers as some want to be deployed in areas with better allowances. “Unequal allowances encourages corruption because others would want to influence their transfer to Nairobi to pocket huge payments,” an officer said. There have been claims that some officers were taking advantage of the ongoing reforms to ask for transfers with the hope of getting bigger allowances. House allowances for police constables were initially categorised into three with those in Nairobi pocketing Sh18,124. Those in cluster two which includes Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru, Uasin Gishu and Meru were getting Sh13,124. Other regions across the country fall under cluster three, Constables there earn Sh8,124 in allowances. The allowances have been reduced to Sh9,500 for those in Nairobi, Sh7,000 for clusters two and Sh5,500 for the rest.
