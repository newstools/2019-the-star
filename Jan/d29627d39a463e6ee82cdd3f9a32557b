Kenya Pipeline women’s team received major boost with the return of their captain Triza Atuka to training after three months of recuperation. Atuka has been away for the last three months after undergoing stomach surgery that saw her miss the Kenya Volleyball Federation national play-offs in Nairobi last year. Her absence coupled with six other players, who wanted out days before the play-offs, saw Pipeline finish third behind Kenya Commercial Bank and winners Kenya Prisons. Atuka said she is glad to be back to training but admitted that she has a mountain to climb as she embarks on working on her fitness. “Definitely it feels good to be back again to what I love doing having been away for quite sometime. I hit the gymnasium today (yesterday) to work on my fitness and really it’s Day One and I cant say much. I just have to wait and see how my body will respond going forward,” said the reigning Africa’s best middle blocker. “My focus is to hit my form book well ahead of the Africa Club championship and the KVF League. I know It’s not going to be easy but I’m determined to make it work. My hope is to perform well in the Africa Club Championship and the league.” The oil merchants finished third during the last year’s Africa Club Championships. Meanwhile, former national team player Esther Jepkosgei has been drafted into the Pipeline bench. Jepkosgei, a former national team trainer, will work alongside Margaret Indakala as the team awaits to unveil the head coach. Indakala and Jepkosgei are filling the void left by former coach, Japheth Munala who switched allegiance to KCB earlier this month.
