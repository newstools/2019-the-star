The United Nations in Mali says two of its peacekeepers have been killed after the convoy they were travelling in hit a mine. Several others were injured, one of them seriously. The incident took place near the town of Duenza in central Mali. The peacekeeping mission was set up in 2012 after Islamist militants took control of much of the country. They were pushed back by French troops, but have continued their attacks. Click here for the latest political news
