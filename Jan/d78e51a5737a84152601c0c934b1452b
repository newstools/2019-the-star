Rehabilitation centres are not the best way to treat drug addiction because they don’t assure of reformation, Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo said yesterday. Mbogo said most rehabs are expensive. “We have seen people who have paid a lot of money at rehabs only to relapse and go back to drugs. I do not support the creation of rehab centres,” Mbogo said. He said drug addicts need family and friends to be closer to them and show them love. The lawmaker said the decision to quit drugs must come from the addicts themselves. “Most of the addicts who run to rehabilitation centres after organisations or the government announce free treatment go there just to impress people,” Mbogo said. He spoke after donating cooler boxes, buckets, uniform for addicts’ children, wheelbarrows, rakes among other tools of trade to 20 reforming addicts at Hongera in Kisauni. The equipment were bought at more than Sh100,000, the MP said. Kisauni is one of the areas with the highest number of drug addicts in Mombasa. It is estimated that 50,000 drug addicts are in Mombasa. Mbogo said the 20 reforming addicts approached him and asked for equipment to start up small businesses like fruit vending, coconut selling, juice making, fish selling and garbage collection. The MP said creating more rehabilitation centres was like urging more people to get into addiction. “It will be like telling people to take more drugs because there are facilities that will treat you should you become an addict,” he said.
