Talk of Kenyans living in opulence, former Kiambu governor William Kabogo posted a picture of himself relaxing next to a calm water body. Kenyans were left struggling to unravel the mystery.

The governor has been having sexual affairs with nominated MCAs, in the county, at will for a long time.The MCAs, who colleagues have branded 'the governor's slayqueens', roam around the governor's office waiting for his phone call, a sign that he needs a massage. The affairs are so brazen a male MCA, seemingly disgusted by the habit, was overheard saying: 'This is embarrassing. How can they tell us to leave the (governor's) office to give them time?This is embarrassment.‚Äù The desperate MCAs are enticed by the governor's generosity, and are now a regular presence in his public events.

One was even overhead bragging that they have a machete to chop off anyone who sticks their heads out. Is this not blatant abuse of office?. ****** Concerns are being raised about the much-publicised government textbook distribution policy. Some high-ranking officials in the Ministry of Education are believed to have taken advantage of the workload in the publishing and printing houses and forced publishers to hire their relatives. The printing and publishing process began in October, last year, and will run through March. Most of those contracted are casual labourers in packaging, loading and unpacking of the consignments.
