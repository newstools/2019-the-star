National beach volleyball team coach Patrick Owino wants more sand courts put up in Nairobi if the country is to take the game to the next level. This is after they failed to finalise their programme during the first national circuit at Strathmore University   over the weekend. “The turnout was very encouraging for starters. We recorded 100 percent increase at Strathmore as compared to previous tournaments, which have been held in Mombasa in the past,” said Owino. “Holding the beach volleyball circuits at the Coast was not working out well for players in terms of logistics. I think this is the reason we had a huge turn out at Strathmore since most volleyball players live in Nairobi. We have a large pool of players with developed skills for this game who we would not have discovered if we stuck to playing in Mombasa.” The Kenya Volleyball Federation beach volleyball commission have resolved to make draws days to the tournament to save on time on the competition day. The women’s semifinals will see Aspire’s—veteran Ednah Rotich and Phoscah Kasisi—come face-to-face with Kenya Commercial Bank duo of Salome Wanjala and Eunice Maiyo, while the second pits Kenya Pipeline pair of Gaudencia Makokha and Naomi Too and Divas partnership of Gladys Wangui and Leonida Kasaya. In the men’s penultimate duels, Strathmore’s Wilfred Kimutai and Mathias Kemboi lock horns with Wanyonge’s Philip Karari and Mutua Kilonzo. The other semis will see Madigaga comprising of James Mutero and Elijah Bosire play team Kiambu featuring veterans Ibrahim Oduori and James Mwaniki.
