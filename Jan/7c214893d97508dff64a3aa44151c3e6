Celebrated female artiste Vivianne has defended her move to pay for one person to go to Nigeria alongside Kaligraph Jones. She took the measure after Jones offered to take 10 Kenyan media personalities to Nigeria for a 10-day trip so they could be recognised by their fans. Speaking about the issue, Vivianne said: "I thought it would be an interesting way to bring the conversation home when it comes to airplay because at the end of the day, I believe if you are Kenyan, your number one loyalty should be to Kenyan content. "I just wanted to challenge everyone who contributes to the entertainment scene to understand that it is important for us to remain loyal to our work."
