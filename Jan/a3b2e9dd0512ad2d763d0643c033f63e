A children's rights activist has supported Narok county commissioner George Natembeya’s call for upper primary and secondary schoolgirls to be tested for FGM as they report to school. Dorothy Parit, who runs Hope Beyond Rescue Centre for abused girls in Kimana, Kajiado South subcounty, on Sunday said, “Such checks when schools open could provide results that can assist the state take action against wayward parents and those who assisted the girls to undergo FGM." She made the remark after participating in the rescue of a 14-year-old being married off by her parents on Friday in Eselenkei, Kajiado South subcounty. The girl, who is a Standard Four pupil, was being married off to a 45-year-old man - Lemuja ole Nkoro - who already has two wives. On receiving the information of the minor’s forced marriage, Parit alerted the police who laid an ambush. The man escaped. The rescue centre is providing shelter to the girl. Many condemned the call to inspect girls, saying it is a violation of their privacy and would cause trauma. Natembeya defended the directive, saying some parents abet those carrying out FGM and the only way to track perpetrators is to find victims and trace culprits from there. Anti-FGM board chairperson Agnes Pareiyo last week said no Narok girl had been tested for FGM or pregnancy as they went back to school. Click here for the latest political news
