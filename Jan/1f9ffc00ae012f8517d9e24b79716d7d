The government will screen and immunise residents of three counties affected by hepatitis B in the North Rift. At least 25 people have died and more than 100 tested positive in Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo and West Pokot in the last four months. Hepatitis B, a liver infection, can cause scarring of the organ, liver failure and cancer. It can be fatal if not treated. It is spread when people come into contact with the blood, open sores or body fluids of someone who has the virus. Using contaminated water is a major problem. Health PS Peter Tum said the immunisation will go on for the next three months. Elgeyo Marakwet governor Alex Tolgos met Medical Services director Jackson Kioko to discuss how to deal with the outbreak. “We will launch public screening and immunisation in the next month in for all residents in affected areas,” Tolgos said. He said the disease is a major health threat.The county has started screening in some areas where records indicate many residents are affected, the governor said. “Out of the 224 people tested in the past one week in Chegilet Health Centre alone, 21 tested positive,” he said. The facility serves Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties. Tolgos’ government has taken urgent measures to carry out public awareness, testing and sub sidised vaccination countywide. Tolgos called upon all residents to go for vaccination to help in taming the spread. Health executive Kiprono Chepkok said the infection statistics were alarming. Hepatitis B carriers may have no symptoms until they have suffered extensive liver damage. “This is why we want our people to get screened and vaccinated so they acquire lifetime immunity,” Chepkok said. Elgeyo Marakwet lowered the cost of vaccination to Sh600 from Sh1,000 after new cases were reported, raising fears the disease could spread fast. Thirteen cases were recorded in Endo ward, with one case each in Emsoo and Soy South.The national government will partner with county governments to fight the outbreak.
