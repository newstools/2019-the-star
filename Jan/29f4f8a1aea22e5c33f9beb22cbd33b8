Environment director Lawrence Mwangi told the Star yesterday that the metallic skips had arrived and will be distributed in estates and Kariakor, Kariobangi, Dandora and Kawangware markets. He did not say how many were procured. “We get huge garbage deposits from estates and markets The skips have a higher holding capacity than the normal bins, “ he said.
