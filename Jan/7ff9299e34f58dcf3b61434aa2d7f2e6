Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga has endorsed Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi for the Siaya gubernatorial seat in 2022. Rasanga said Wandayi’s development track record as an MP is undisputable and “the people of Ugunja can attest to it.” Addressing residents at Ugunja on Saturday, Rasanga said that as governor, he knows the best candidate after he exits. Rasanga recalled how Wandayi was the only Siaya MP who stood with him in all three elections he has contested. “It’s only fair that when someone scratches your back, you scratch his back too. It would be unfair if I don’t scratch Wandayi’s after he scratched mine in 2013 and in 2017,” Rasanga said. He added that Siaya needs a committed candidate to carry on where he leaves off, like Wandayi. It’s not the first time Wandayi is being advocated to succeed Rasanga.Last year, several county leaders asked Wandayi to run for governor. Alego Usonga boda bodas also praised Wandayi. Gem ODM youth representative Charles Onguko supported Wandayi for governor saying he has been tested and proven by the party. The only declared candidates so far are Siaya Senator James Orengo and Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda.Ochanda said 2022 politics should be left for voters to decide. “I know many candidates will present themselves for the governor’s seat at the right time,” the MP said.He said those endorsing others must make sure they have voted and “not make empty promises”. Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo said Rasanga has the right to support Wandayi with his sole vote, but “Gem people and I are behind Senator James Orengo.” “No one knows better how devolution can work well for the people of Siaya than Orengo who drafted the devolution structures,” Odhiambo said.
