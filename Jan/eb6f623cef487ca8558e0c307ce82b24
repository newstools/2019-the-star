Gospel singer Willy Paul has thanked God for saving his life from terrorists in Tuesday's Riverside attack. "Life is precious, I got no injuries and my God is great and He has good plans for me," Willy Paul told Word Is yesterday. The singer said he was at Cellulant office next to Dusit 2 Hotel for a business meeting. It wasn’t long after the meeting commenced that all hell broke loose. This was at around 3pm. "Everyone was confused after the loud bang of gunshots," he said. Traumatised, Willy Paul took to social media to recount his ordeal. “Today, I’ve seen how much God loves me!! He’s given me another chance to live. I hope everyone survived the attack at Dusit. I’ve never come across such a thing in my life!!! People have been injured and some have lost their lives!!” he wrote. Willy Paul said people tried to jump over a fence to save their lives. "We exited through the emergency route, although it was so full of people. There was a fence," he said. "I sympathised with women and ladies because the fence was high. People broke their arms there. I mean it was a bad experience."
