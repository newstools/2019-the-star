The three Chinese and one Kenyan arrested by police on Tuesday after being found withÂ game meat and ivory will be detained at Kilimani police station for five days. They appeared before magistrate Caroline Nzibe at the Milimani law courts on Wednesday. The state had wanted them detained for 10 days to allow completion of investigations. The four - Shang Li Yan, Xing Wei, Zhang Jie and David Oseko - were arrested after neighbours complained of a foul smell emanating from their five-bedroomed house. After raiding the house, officers found decomposing game meat in a freezer. Also recovered were two ivory tusks and sculptures each, one lion sculpture, ivory bangles and necklaces, a tortoise, leopard skin and rhino horn all valued at Sh6.3 million.
