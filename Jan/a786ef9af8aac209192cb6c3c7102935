A woman was charged yesterday at a Mombasa court with giving false information about her alleged fake abduction. Saida Abdulrahman was charged alongside her husband. They denied the charges before principal magistrate Christine Ogweno. The couple were granted Sh100,000 bond. The case will be mentioned on January 24. The alleged abduction prompted fears over the security of residents, especially pregnant mothers. The court heard that Saida lied to her family that she was pregnant.  She claimed her abductors injected her with a labour-inducing chemical that terminated the pregnancy. Saida was bleeding when she gained consciousness and realised she had lost her unborn child, she had told the police. On September 20, Saida informed Doctor Nafsa Mohamed of the Coast General Hospital that she was eight months pregnant when her abductors procured her an abortion. The court heard that Saida intended to have the medic write a report in her favour. A report by the gynaecologist indicated, however, that she was not pregnant. “In fact, doctors say she is unable to conceive because she has a problem with her uterus,” DCI boss officer Jacob Kanake said. Her husband Mohamed Abdulkarim was accused of informing a police officer that his eight-year-old pregnant wife had gone missing on her way to Malindi where she was to take a flight to Lamu. The police launched a search for her soon after he lodged the complaint. The 20-year-old woman was reportedly abducted from a Tuk Tuk car in Mombasa and was found in Majengo slums in Nairobi four days later.
