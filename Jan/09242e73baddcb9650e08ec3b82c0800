Education CS Amina Mohamed has 14 days to harmonise the regulations of admission to the teachers training colleges. In December last year, Employment and Labour Relations court Judge Byram Ongaya stopped the CS from lowering the entry grade for teachers’ training colleges from C to D+ and directed she convenes a meeting to harmonise the regulations of admission and report to court yesterday to confirm progress. KUPPET yesterday told the Judge that the meeting is yet to be convened and that the CS is deliberately defying the orders. But the lawyer representing the Ministry of Education said that they have not defied the order but requested for fourteen more days to comply. “When a court order was issued, the President released a circular directing all his Cabinet Secretaries and Principal Secretaries to proceed on leave. So the CS has not been in a position to proceed with the meeting,” said Lawyer Mbilu. Frontier counties Development Council (FCDC) comprising Garissa, Tana River, Wajir, Lamu and others told the court that the actions by the government are unfair. Through Lawyer Issa Mansour, FCDC wanted the order issued by the court varied and allow the 3265 students to enroll as the outstanding issues are resolved by the Ministry, Teachers Service Commission and other key stakeholders. The students according to Mansour were to join yesterday. “This policy by government was meant to address a systemic and long standing problem in these counties. The 3265 are the ones affected by the order,” he said. Read: Strike blocked, Knut, TSC to resume talks Click here for the latest political news
