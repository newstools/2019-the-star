A section of business operators at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport are opposed to proposals to have Kenya Airways manage the airport for 30 years. To express their displeasure, they plan to boycott today’s forum on the Privately Initiated Investment Proposal (PIIP). In an unsigned statement the group drawn from the hospitality, transport and service sectors said they will boycott the forum because they have not been provided with details. ‘’We know nothing about the PIIP. They should consider postponing the forum to enable us study the proposal,’’ the group said in the statement. They further questioned Kenya Airway’s ability to manage other entities when its own management has failed, sinking in debts. “Kenya Airways owes Kenya Airport Authority (KAA) and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) billions. It makes sense for KAA and KCAA to convert KQ’s debts into equity and manage it. Not the other way round,” the group said. Flight engineers represented by Robert Omollo added that KQ should be acquired and its management streamlined to enhance efficiency.
