A man has been shot dead by gangsters who were escaping after robbing M-Pesa shops in Athi River on Monday. Athi River police boss Sharma Wario told the Star in his office on Tuesday another person was seriously injured during the 5.40pm incident. The two were among residents who attempted to block thieves who were escaping on motorbikes after stealing from two M-Pesa shops at Njuguini estate. “The thugs, who were brandishing guns, entered the first M-Pesa shop and demanded cash. The attendant [a woman] gave them Sh77,000,” Wario said. They also stole seven mobile phones that were on display and airtime scratch cards worth Sh86,000. Wario said in second M-Pesa shop, the thugs stole a mobile phone only. He said the gang escaped on two motorcycles after shooting two people. “The shop attendants raised the alarm. Members of the public confronted the gangsters. They did not know that they were armed. The thugs shot two people, one died at the scene,” Wario said. The survivor is recovering at Shalom Community Hospital, and the deceased’s body is in the mortuary at the same hospital. “The motorbikes sped towards Kitengela town. We are investigating the robberies,” Wario said. He said police have launched a manhunt for gangsters. Wario said police have crucial leads and appealed to the public to give information that will lead to the arrest of the gang. Click here the latest political news
