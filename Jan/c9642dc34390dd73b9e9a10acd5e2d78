ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has called for expansion of the Building of Bridges Initiative to make it all inclusive claiming it currently locks out a number of stakeholders. Mudavadi speaking after a church service at Redeemed Gospel Church BuruBuru said the initiative is currently viewed as a two men affair and will not achieve much. The Nasa principal wants the clergy, civil society, women and youths incorporated into the initiative whose term elapses in three months time. He noted BBI might not achieve much if it continued to be perceived as serving interest of only President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. “It must be broadened to include all categories of Kenyans. President Uhuru and Raila have a responsibility to see that it is widely accepted,” Mudavadi said. “When we talk of inclusivity, it is not a must that Musalia must be there on the round-table but where are the youths, women, the clergy and members of the civil society?” he posed. In May last year, the 14-member Building Bridges initiative was officially gazetted and given a year to submit a comprehensive report to the two leaders. They included Adams Oloo , Agnes Kavindu, Senator Amos Wako, Florence Omose, Saeed Mwanguni, James Matundura, Major John Seii, Bishop Lawi Imathiu, Maison Leshomo, Senator Mohamed Yusuf Haji, Morompi ole Ronkai, Bishop Peter Njenga, Rose Moseu and former Kisumu archbishop Zacheus Okoth. Amb Martin Kimani and lawyer Paul Mwangi are the taskforce’s joint secretaries. Mudavadi however expressed support for the handshake between President Uhuru and opposition chief Raila Odinga but insisted the current BBI must be formatted to take the Bomas constitution approach.The ANC party leader also called for a quick fix to the IEBC which he said cannot be trusted with any national exercise including the upcoming boundary delimitattion. Mudavadi was accompanied by Vihiga woman representative Beatrice Adagala.
