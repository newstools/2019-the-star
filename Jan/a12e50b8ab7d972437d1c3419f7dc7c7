The disease can spread through contact with infected mucus and saliva. An infected person can spread the disease by coughing or sneezing. The virus can live on surfaces for several hours. As the infected particles enter the air and settle on surfaces, anyone within close proximity can become infected. Drinking from an infected person’s glass, or sharing eating utensils with an infected person increases the risk of infection. Symptoms generally appear within 14 days of exposure to the virus. They include cough, fever, red eyes, light sensitivity, muscle aches, runny nose, sore throat and white spots inside the mouth.
