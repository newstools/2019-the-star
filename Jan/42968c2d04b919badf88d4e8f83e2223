Nurses in Tharaka Nithi county have threatened to go on strike if they are not paid leave and uniform allowances within 21 days. Kenya National Union of Nurses branch chairman Fabian Marigu said the government had taken too long to pay their 2017 nursing service and 2018 uniform allowance and salary arrears. He said nurses were also yet to be promoted. The union also wants Governor Muthomi Njuki's administration to pay nurses hired on contract. In early December 2018, the Tharaka Nithi county government moved in to avert a looming strike by holding a meeting with union officials. After the meeting, nurses dropped their bid to join their colleagues in a nationwide strike in order to give their employer more time to implement the 2017 return-to-work formula. But the nurses say no changes have been made yet. Click here for the latest political news
