Comedian Churchill was among the people who were at Riverside when the attack happened on Tuesday. "By the way, I was there," he said. "But we will be fine and everyone who was involved. We are strong." Other survivors include Ronald Ng’eno, who was among the first people to paint a picture of what was happening at the DustIt Hotel complex at a time when it was just a rumour. He posted: "If I die I love the Lord and believe I will go to heaven please tell my family I love then I love you Caleb, Mark and Carol." He was finally rescued early Wednesday morning after more than 10 hours. Boni Khalwale’s daughter and Musalia Mudavadi's son were also rescued.
