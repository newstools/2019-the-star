A Machakos boy who scored 405 marks in last year's KCPE has all reasons to smile after getting a full scholarship from the Kenya Commercial Bank. Nicholas Kioko Mulwa of Kiangini village, Mumbuni location in Machakos had lost hope of joining form one after his mother, the sole breadwinner died on December 14 last year, just a month after the release of the results. Kioko who aspires to be an engineer in the future will be joining Machakos Boys High school. His father had died earlier in 2017 after he was allegedly poisoned while taking beer at a popular club in Machakos town. "I was in class seven when my dad died and we were left under the care of our poor mum," Kioko told The Star on Tuesday. He is among four students awarded scholarships by the KCB Machakos branch. The others are Samuel Maingi who scored 423 marks, Isaac Kyale (403) and Peter Mutemi (398). He and his late mother made two applications for sponsorship soon after the results, one to the Equity Bank and the other to the KCB. Unfortunately, Kioko's mother could not live to see the reply to the two applications. "At first I thought he was lying when he told us that his mother was dead yet we can see her signature in the application form, I came to believe it when we visited the home and found villagers in the homestead preparing for a burial," Machakos KCB branch Manager Simon Halonda told the Star. According to Kioko's aunt, her sister started complaining of being weak and experiencing some Muscle pulls on December 10 but died at the Machakos Level 5 Hospital four days later. Halonda said the scholarship will include paying his full secondary school fees, buying him school uniformÂ and paying for his transport and shopping. The bank has so far sponsored 72 students in the county. Click here for the latest political news
