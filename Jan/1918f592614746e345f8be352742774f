Head teachers have until February 15 to register this year’s KCPE and KCSE candidates, the Kenya National Examination Council has said. Knec acting chief executive Mercy Karogo said the deadline also applies to those wishing to register for KCSE Qualifying Test examinations (QT). The registration drive started on January 2. The QT is a proficiency test measuring a candidate’s ability to sit the KCSE exam. It is taken in one day during November of the year preceding the exam year. The examination is open to all bona fide Kenyan residents and those in the Kenyan missions abroad. They make a formal application to Knec six months before the year of the examination. Those eligible to sit the exam must be holders of a primary certificate other than the KCPE certificate, for instance, Certificate of Primary Education (CPE) or holders of a foreign primary certificate received after less than eight years of primary school education. Karogo said all registration must be done online. “Person wishing to register as private candidates are advised to download the private candidates’ registration form from the Knec website www.knec.ac.ke, complete it and submit it to subcounty director of education for further guidance during the registration period,” she said in a circular on Tuesday. Registration for individuals wishing to sit their KCSE Qualifying Test will be done at the subcounty director of education offices. “All students, parents, head teachers, principals and subcounty directors of education are hereby advised to adhere to the deadlines as prescribed by the council,” Karogo said. The Education ministry will pay examination fees for all KCPE and KCSE candidates in both private and public schools. Last year, the ministry incurred Sh40 million as waiver on exam fees. Private candidates, those in prisons, those repeating and non-citizens will, however, be required to pay for the exams.
