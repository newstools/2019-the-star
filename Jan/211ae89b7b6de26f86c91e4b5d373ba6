Besides a couple of tasks to dispense with, I also needed to return my university graduation gown, since it was well past deadline and penalties were accumulating. _____________________________________________________ Linturi's daughter wants orders barring her father from entering Runda home discharged The firstborn daughter of Meru Senator Mithika Linturi says her father’s estranged wife Marriane Kitany was cruel and hostile during the time she stayed in the palatial Runda home.
