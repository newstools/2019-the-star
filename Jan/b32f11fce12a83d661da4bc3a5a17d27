The Abagusii Council of Elders yesterday praised President Uhuru Kenyatta for giving Interior CS Fred Matiang’i more powers. A celebratory mood swept the minister’s Kisii backyard. Matiang’i was put in charge of the national government’s development agenda. The elders said the appointment was well deserved and a “big honour”. “The appointment could not have come at a better time. It’s a vote of confidence in the ability of the CS. As a community, we want to thank the President for this gesture,” chairman James Matundura said. Matundura is also a member if the Building Bridges Initiative taskforce. He said the President was within his constitutional mandate to appoint a ‘Cabinet supervisor’ to spearhead the Big Four agenda. “There are those who have argued that the President exercised extraconstitutional powers. However, that is neither here nor there. Matiang’i will be a strong link in Uhuru’s legacy projects,” Matundura said. He was accompanied by other council members. Matundura said Matiang’i had demonstrated ability to deliver results in all the dockets he has held. Read: The rise and rise of 'super minister' Fred Matiang'i Click here for the latest political news
