A schoolgirl was on Monday injured by a hyena as she went to school in Ongata Rongai, Kajiado county. Olkeri Mixed Secondary School principal Simon Muchina said the Form 2 student was walking to school at 6am along Gataka road when she was attacked. When he went to the scene after receiving a report of the attack, Muchina said the found the student had been taken to Ongata Rongai Health Centre. "A Good Samaritan picked up the student who was bleeding from the head and hands, but left a man who had saved the girl from the beast," Muchina said. He said the man said three hyenas attacked the student, but she said it was a hyena and its two cubs. Muchina said the student was later admitted to Mbagathi Hospital in Nairobi then discharged. "Doctors said the student suffered a fracture on one of her hands. The man who saved her was treated at Ongata Rongai Health Centre and discharged," he said. The principal reported the matter to the Kenya Wildlife Service and recorded a statement at Ngong police station. KWS warden in charge of Kajiado North Rose Malenya said she dispatched a team to check the report. "The attack occurred in bushes between Gataka and the school. The community is advised to avoid walking through forests early in the morning or late in the evening," she said. "This forest has been a wildlife habitat for many generations. It is humans who have encroached, and, therefore, this is escalating conflicts. However, occasionally we patrol the area early to remove some of the animals." Click here for the latest political news
