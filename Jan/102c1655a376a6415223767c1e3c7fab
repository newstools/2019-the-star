Matatu operators have been urged to reduce fares following a drop in fuel prices two weeks ago. The Energy Regulatory Commission cut prices of super petrol, diesel and kerosene by Sh9.33, Sh10.04, and Sh3.52. "It is not fare for commuters to suffer as they dig deeper into the
pockets for fare...it will be just if the matatu saccos can reduce the
fares by Sh10," Matatu Operators Association chairman Jimal Ibrahim said yesterday. In September last year, matatu saccos increased fares in Nairobi by
Sh20 and 20 per cent for long distance travel after 16 per cent VAT was
levied on petroleum products. President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered the National Transport and Safety Authority to revoke the licences of operators who would increase fares after the tax, but it was of no effect. Jimal said commuters should not be paying the same fares they paid when the fuel prices increased last year. He said matatu owners should adjust fares to accommodate commuters and sacco members' interests. Tellaviv, Metro Trans, Zamzam, Route 58 and Manchester are among the saccos that have already adjusted their fares . Matatu operators usually increase fares when it rains, or during a crisis such as a strike.
