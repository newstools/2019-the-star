Doctors want more time to consider a 20 per cent cut in fees proposed by the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board. On Tuesday doctors in the Kenya Medical Association boycotted a public consultation organised by medical insurance companies who have been making losses. Private healthcare in Kenya is much more expensive than in India and is similar to that in Europe. Kenyan doctors have not been very cooperative in bringing costs down. Last week they opposed a request by medical insurers to use mainly generic drugs which are much cheaper, arguing that this limited their ability to treat patients. But patients will suffer even more if they canâ€™t afford treatment because doctors prefer expensive brand-name drugs promoted by pharmaceutical companies. And some fees, for instance Sh60,000 for a basic procedure like circumcision, are clearly excessive. Doctors and hospitals also do not want to provide itemised billing to the insurance companies. Healthcare needs to be made more affordable. Doctors need to be realistic about the social environment in which they are working. They should cooperate with insurance companies in controlling costs.
