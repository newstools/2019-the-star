Kenya Harlequins assistant coach Benjamin Ayimba has set his sights on finishing in the top two of the Kenya Cup in a bid to earn a home semifinal in the playoffs. Quins are currently third on the log with 31points—nine behind runaway league leaders Kabras and four adrift of KCB with the league at half-way stage.  Quins sent a statement of intent to the rest of the league teams with a 37-24 demolition of rivals Impala in the Ngong Road derby over the weekend. The top two teams at the end of the group phase have a bye to the semis, where they will host the winners of the playoffs. Ayimba said as a club that’s the target for this season. “We have got momentum and playing well and want to host the semis. With the current crop of players and their form, I think we can go all the way,” added Ayimba.  “The new executive committee have done a good job in motivating the players and giving them incentives. They have also done superb job in giving the technical bench a free hand to work,” he added.  Ayimba also credited the return of head coach Charles Cadovillis to the club as a positive move. “His knowledge of the club and players he has worked with has been a plus and its been evident on the pitch,” noted Ayimba. Quins next host Kabras in a mouth-watering fixture on February 9 at the RFUEA ground.
