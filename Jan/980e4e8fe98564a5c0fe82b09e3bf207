The Form Three student who went missing from Mawingu Secondary school, Kipipiri, on Saturday evening has been found. Ann Wangui Kamau, 18, was found in Engineer town, Kinangop, on Friday afternoon. A resident who saw her called her father’s elder brother and former Kipipiri MCA Michael Kirumba informing him a girl fitting the description given by media houses has been spotted in Engineer town. “I immediately drove to Engineer and found her with a woman at Engineer market. God is great,” he said Kirumba said he did not ask any questions but immediately drove the student home to her parents. He was informed she arrived at the woman’s house on Thursday evening requesting that she be given a place to sleep. There are no details yet on where she had been and with who, or why she left school. Her parents, Harun Kamau and Ruth Wanjiku, said they lacked words to express their joy after getting back their daughter safe and sound. “I was so depressed knowing that my daughter lacks nothing here at home and school. But now I am so grateful and I thank God that my daughter is back home and I am holding her with my hands," Kamau said. “I thank God and all those who supported us through prayers and in other ways. All people should now be at peace as we continue serving this faithful God," Wanjiku said amid tears. Mawingu Secondary School principal Mary King’eca said the school fraternity is happy that the student has been found. She urged the students to discuss problems with teachers. “We are just very excited. We thank God. She had stressed us. The students should be seeking assistance from us instead of running away from school. We shall help them," she said. Click here for the latest political news
