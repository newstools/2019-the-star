The memorial service for Chief Lenku ole Mpaa was turned into a political arena when politicians allied to Governor Joseph Lenku attacked unnamed political enemies. Before the politicians started the tirade, Maasai elders paid tribute to Mpaa, who played politics in the league of the likes of Stanley Oloitiptip in the Southern end of the region. The service was attended by Jubilee MCAs as well as those aligned to the opposition, in a display o their support to Lenku. Kaputiei North MCA Joshua Olowuasa said he had broken ties with Kajiado East MP Peris Tobiko for allegedly claiming she will teach Lenku a lesson in 2022. Tobiko in December saidÂ  if she will seek a higher political position in the county, she would relinquish and surrender her seat to Olowuasa.
