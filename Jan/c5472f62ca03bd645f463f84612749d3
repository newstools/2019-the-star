Malava MP Malulu Injendi has accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of turning against the Deputy President by giving Interior CS Fred Matiang’i sweeping powers. He said DP William Ruto has been launching development projects and it was unfair for the President to throw him under the bus. “As people who supported Jubilee, we’re not happy. It’s unfair for the head of state to undermine his deputy,” Injendi said. Other Western lawmakers, however, praised the move. Lugari MP Ayub Savula said creating the National Development Implementation and Communication Cabinet Subcommittee under Matiang’i will promote coordinated development countryside. “This will end the haphazard launching of projects that never take off,” he said. Savula said Matiang’i deserves his elevation. He has been competent in the dockets he has served, he said. Butere’s Tindi Mwale praised the President for seeking to improve services and give impetus to the Big Four. He warned Kenyans against reading too much into the changes, but said Ruto’s influence has been diluted. “The President has powers to issue executive orders. He may have realised he cannot do away with the DP and decided to use executive orders to take away his powers,” he said.
