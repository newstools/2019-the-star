Farmers have asked the government to regulate importation of cheap rice to save them from making losses. Led by Gerald Odoyo, rice growers at the West Kano Irrigation Scheme on Saturday asked for the establishment of a mill in the area. “The mill will allow for the processing and packaging of rice for sale in local supermarkets,” Odoyo said. He said cheap imports have flooded the market making it difficult for farmers to sell. “We also have the challenge of driving away birds. The government should find us an appropriate technology to deal with the birds,” Odoyo said. He spoke to reporters at the scheme even as National Irrigation Board manager Joel Tanui called for better marketing strategies.
