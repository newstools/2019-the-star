One of the suspects linked to Wednesday's murder of a 25-year-old man at the Unilever tea estate has been arrested. The KK security guard, Collins Langat, attached to Koiwa estate, was arrested at his hideout at Saosa on Friday night. Konoin OCPD Alex Shikondi said the suspect was found at his father's house where he had been hiding. Speaking to the Star, the police boss said his officers got a tip-off from members of the public. The suspect will be arraigned in court on Monday. The second suspect, also a guard at the firm, is still on run. The duo is said to have roughed up the man, who later succumbed to his injuries. He had been accused of trespassing into Koiwa tea estate to pluck tea. The deceased, Shikondi said, was bundled into a car belonging to the tea estate and driven around before being thoroughly beaten and dumped by the roadside. The police boss said that a good Samaritan found the unconscious man on Thursday morning and attended to him before rushing him to Kapkatet hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. "He was taken to the hospital with fresh bruises on his body, open wound on the left leg and a swollen back," he said. Shikondi said they have towed the car which the suspects used to the Mogogosiek police station as investigations continue. Crude weapons, believed to have been used in the murder, were found in the car. "We also found fresh tea leaves and a t-shirt with blood stains in the car," the police boss said.
