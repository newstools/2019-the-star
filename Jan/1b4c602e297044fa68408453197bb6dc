Kenyans have many peculiar habits, but while some might not be dangerous, there is one that exposes many people to danger. The city has had two bomb explosions within 12 days; the first was at Dusit2 Hotel where 21 people perished. The second one was on Saturday outside Smothers Restaurant at the Tom Mboya-Latema Road intersection in Nairobi. In both instances, members of the public, who have no role at the scene of crime, ran towards the scene instead getting as far away as possible. And what do they run there to do? To go and see what has happened! This not only exposes them to danger in case of a second major explosion but also hampers emergency rescue efforts and police operations. Movement becomes difficult, suspects easily mingle with the crowd and escape. The crime scene is disturbed. If you have no business at a crime scene, please do not go there to gawk. Instead clear the area and let medical and security personnel carry out their work. Police must equally move fast to cordon off and properly secure crime scenes and keep onlookers far away.
