Good Morning. After 14 years of agony and hopelessness, the family of Dr John Ondeko has been awarded Sh47 million as compensation for medical negligence. Their son's brain was damaged after a botched operation. Once a bubbly young man, Jacob Oluochi is a shell of himself. His memory cannot grasp instructions and the family wonders if he will ever be independent. Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Thursday morning. How NASA planned to cripple Uhuru rule Exiled maverick lawyer Miguna Miguna has laid bare what he claims was NASA’s strategy to cripple President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration in a record three months. In his new book, Treason: The Case Against Tyrants and Renegades, Miguna says the plan was to mobilise a million strong crowd for the swearing-in ceremony of Opposition chief Raila Odinga. However, after the oath, the mammoth crowed would not disperse, but instead kick-off daily protests against Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto for at least two months without a break. _____________________________________________________ Stop Ruto movement takes shape A robust political movement cobbled to block Deputy President William Ruto’s bid to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta is taking shape as Mt Kenya leaders plot to dump Jubilee. The anti-Ruto brigade, the political wing opposed to Ruto’s 2022 State House bid, has crafted an elaborate strategy which they say will ground the DP’s presidential juggernaut. Part of the plan, the Star can reveal, involves plotting a mass Mt Kenya walkout from Jubilee and launching aggressive anti-Ruto campaigns in regions where he is enjoying considerable support out of his Rift Valley backyard. _____________________________________________________ NTSA staff held over Dusit hotel terror attack vehicle At least 12 NTSA employees were on Wednesday being questioned by the police investigating the Dusit hotel terror attack that left 21 people dead. The three, who include two clerks and a section head of the motor vehicle registration department, were arrested by officers from the Special Crimes Prevention Unit and the Anti-terror police unit. Police also carried files and computers for analysis by the Cyber Crime Unit of the DCI. _____________________________________________________ Rift MPs accuse NCPB of imposing hard-to-meet demands to lock out maize farmers Four MPs from North Rift are now accusing the National Cereals and Produce Board of imposing unnecessary safeguard measures to lock out maize farmers from selling produce to the board. MPs Caleb Kositany (Soy), Robert Pukose (Endebes), William Kisang (Marakwet West), Sammy Seroney (nominated) and Kangongo Bowen (Marakwet East) said the NCPB has unreasonable hard-to-meet demands to frustrate farmers. The lawmakers protested against the requirement that any farmer supplying more than 400 bags must get clearance from the Strategic Food Reserve Oversight Board based in Nairobi. _____________________________________________________ Mitumba seller aims for wife but misses, stabs baby instead A secondhand clothes trader allegedly stabbed his eight-month-old son in the belly during a fight with his wife. It was a ‘mistake’ — he was trying to stab his wife. Boniface Wambua, 33, was charged yesterday with assault with intent to cause bodily harm. Court documents show that on January 24, Wambua was enraged by his wife’s late return from work to their house in the Lunga Lunga slums in Industrial Area. _____________________________________________________ For more on these stories and others, keep browsing the Star website for the latest news making headlines across Kenya and around the world.
