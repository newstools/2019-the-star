Queens Counsel Khawar Qureshi has complied with all requirements needed for him to be issued with a certificate to practise in Kenya, the Judiciary has said. In a letter dated January 14, Chief Registrar of the Judiciary Anne Amadi says, “We confirm there is no other compliance on the part of Professor Khawar Qureshi in regard to issuance of a practicing certificate.” She was responding to a letter by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions dated January 9. DPP Noordin Haji was notifying the registrar about a special license issued to Qureshi by the Attorney General following his appointment. Qureshi paid Sh400 admission fee as is required under the Advocates Act before being allowed to prosecute Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu’s corruption case. Lawyer representing Mwilu want him barred from the case. The court will today determine whether Qureshi can lead the prosecutions team.
