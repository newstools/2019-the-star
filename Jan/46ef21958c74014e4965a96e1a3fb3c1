Police in Transmara East in Narok have arrested a teacher who allegedly defiled a 14-year-old pupil on Wednesday. Deputy County Commissioner Mohammed Dakane said the suspect was nabbed at Kiribwet Primary School where he teaches. Speaking to the Star on the phone, Dakane said members of the public alerted the police after the suspect went missing after the incident on Christmas Day. "The Standard Seven pupil had reported the matter to the police. We have been looking for the suspect with the help of the education office," Dakane said. He said the suspect disappeared when he realised police were looking for him. Dakane said the girl had told her mother that she had been sexually assaulted in a thicket near Kiribwet trading centre. He thanked the public for volunteering information that led to the suspect's arrest. Dakane warned men who are fond of defiling schoolgirls that their days are numbered. The suspect is expected to appear in a Kilgoris court on Thursday morning. He faces defilement charges. Click here for the latest political news
