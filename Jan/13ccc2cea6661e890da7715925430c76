Kenya Tourism Board has won an award for being the best decorated stand in the just concluded Outbound Travel Mart (OTM) tourism fair that ended in India over the weekend. The three day trade fair was held in Bombay exhibition centre and attracted over 1,500 exhibitors from all over the world. More than ten travel companies represented Kenya in the exhibition a positive indicator of the growing interest in Kenya by tourists from India. KTB has projected a 15 per cent growth in the market that recorded 125,032 arrivals last year. KTB director of marketing Jacinta Nzioka said there was great interest in the Kenyan stand, an endorsement of confidence despite the recent terror attacks. “The big number of people visiting Kenyan stands at OTM and deals entered between sellers and our travel trade has been a source of encouragement and indication of Kenya’s resilience with regards to threats of insecurity,” Nzioka said.
