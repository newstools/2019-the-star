Nyamira governor John Nyagarama has told off critics saying he is only focused on development. He said the county needs to make bold steps to realise development. He said he was open to criticism but warned that not every move ought to be criticised. “We know as a government that we have done good things but not to the expectation of all people. That is why we have to give room for criticism but that does not give room for people to keep on criticising my government without a good reason to do so,” Nyagarama said. He was speaking on Thursday during the handing over and taking over of the new county commissioner in Nyamira town. Isaiah Nakoru left the job and was replaced by Amos Mariba in changes announced by Interior CS Fred Matiang’i.
