Kenya Commercial Bank women’s team has parted ways with seven players deemed surplus ahead of the Kenya Volleyball Federation national league. The seven are centre duo of Lydia Too and Stella Kawos, Millicent Wanjala and Joyce Njeri (liberos), left attacker Ruth Jelagat, right attacker Lucy Mumbo and setter Evelyne Asiko. A source within the team said the seven have not been attending training sessions under new coach Japheth Munala at the team’s new base at Ruaraka ground. The source added that the axe was bound to fall as Munala had already moved in with a similar number as he crossed over from Kenya Pipeline last month. “There was no way they could have stayed. Most of them never played during last season and it was only fair that they got released and hopefully they land somewhere else,” the source noted. “Who wouldn’t release players who have not played for a long time when you have signed heavily and come with a lot experience and exposure? KCB signed national team trio of Noel Murambi, left-handed Violet Makuto and Leonida Kasaya. Others are fast-rising Jemimah Siangu, Veronica Tanui, Truphosa Samoei and Christine Njambi. The source at the same time revealed that Kenya Pipeline setter, Joan Muhindi, has been training with KCB while former player, Eunice Maiyo, has been elevated to the position of team trainer. “Muhindi joined the team in training early this week. However, I am not sure if she has moved officially from Pipeline to KCB and we will just have to wait and see what happens.” Should Muhindi, who played second fiddle to Janet Wanja at Pipeline move to KCB, she will muscle for the position with experienced Sally Wanjala, captain Gladys Wairimu and upcoming Tanui. The bankers hit the road running on January 2 ahead of this year’s season as well as the March 16-25 African Club Championship to be staged in Cairo, Egypt.
