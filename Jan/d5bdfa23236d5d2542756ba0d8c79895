After another dry and dusty night, three tiny little black-faced sandgrouse chicks began to “cheep-cheep” to their parents that they were getting thirsty. The sun was just beginning to rise when their father finally took off in a quest to find fresh drinking water, while mother continued to assist the chicks with their daily food-finding lessons. During the dry season, they travel over long distances and face many dangers on the daily “sandgrouse safari”, so that they can possibly bring life-giving moisture to the thirsty chicks. After taking a few sips of thirst-quenching water, and lying down in the water to allow water droplets to stick onto his belly feathers, father immediately took off and headed straight back to the waiting family. Sandgrouse belly feathers are specially adapted for absorbing water and retaining it, allowing adults, particularly males, to carry water to chicks that may be many miles away from watering holes. The amount of water that can be carried in this way is about 15 to 20 millilitres. There are 16 known species of sandgrouse on earth. They are traditionally placed in two genera. The two central Asian species are classified as Syrrhaptes and the other fourteen species, from Africa and Asia, are placed in the genus Pterocles. They are ground-dwelling birds restricted to treeless, open country, such as plains, savannahs and semi-deserts. The park has a great variety of birds, and sandgrouse are one of the amazing creatures found in the park. I always find it a joy to see birds when driving in the park. God has created so such amazing diversity. When you go to the Nairobi National Park, the Athi basin dam in particular can be very rewarding for sandgrouse sightings in the early mornings, as they go on the daily “sandgrouse safari”.
