Kajiado county government is looking for a suitable person to head its water board, a day after former Kenya Airways CEO Titus Naikuni turned down governor Joseph Lenku’s job offer. County Water executive Florence Waiganjo confirmed receipt of Naikuni’s rejection, adding the county appreciates he is busy serving in many boards in the country. “We accepted his letter which he did in a civil manner, and the governor is already shopping for the right candidate for the position because this is a critical sector in this county,” said Waiganjo yesterday. She said the suitable candidate should be a resident who understands Kajiado and its water issues. “We are happy that Naikuni promised us in his letter that he will be always ready to be consulted every time he is free on water issues. That is very kind of him.” Waiganjo said Lenku’s ban on the sale of un-desalinated water stands. Four boreholes have been sunk in Kitengela and are waiting to be fixed with desalination equipment, she added.
