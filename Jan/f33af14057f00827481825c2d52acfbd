More witnesses statements continue to trickle in at the Siaya criminal investigation department following allegations by a TSC employee that Alego Usonga MP Samuel Atandi slapped her. Siaya county police commander Ambrose Mwawaka on Tuesday said the department started recording statements on Monday and encouraged anyone with information to come forward. The MP is yet to record a statement as requested. Modester Anyuor, the victim, said Atandi stormed the TSC offices on Friday last week and demanded to get her boss' phone number. When she refused to share the number, Anyuor says Atandi slapped her and the youths the MP had came with roughed her up.
