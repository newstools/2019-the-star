The Speaker of the Tanzanian National Assembly Job Ndugai has expressed his sympathy with the families of the victims Tuesday's terror attack at the Dusit complex in Nairobi. He spoke on Thursday when he hosted his Kenyan counterpart at the Parliament Offices in Dar es Salaam. Ndugai said Tanzania stood alongside other friends of Kenya in condemning the attack, which the terror group al Shabaab has claimed responsibility for. " Mr Speaker, we share with you, our esteemed neighbours, the pain caused by this heinous act and wish to express our condolences to the families of those who lost their lives. We wish those who were injured a quick recovery. We stand in solidarity with you during this moment," he said. On his part, Speaker Muturi said Kenya's security agencies had managed the situation quite exemplary. The attack claimed 21 lives and injured scores of others. Muturi said he was particularly impressed by Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti’s response because he arrived at the scene in a record eight minutes and led the rescue operation from the front. Yesterday, Tanzanian President John Magufuli condoled with President Uhuru Kenyatta, and pledged his support and that of the people of Tanzania during this mourning period. Muturi is attending meetings in Tanzania under the auspices of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, Africa Region, for the development of the association’s 2019 work plan. He chairs the executive committee. Click here for the latest political
