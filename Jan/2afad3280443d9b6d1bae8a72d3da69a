Police in Narok have arrested two students suspected to have been recruited by terror group al Shabaab. County police commander Thomas Ngeiwa did not give details, but said the students from Narok West were nabbed at a roadblock in Ntulele in Narok East on their way to Kismayu. The 16-year-old boys were going for training in Somalia. The suspects are being held at Narok police station. “We arrested them last night, but we will not give more information because the matter is being investigated,” Ngeiywa said on Thursday. He said members of the public tipped off the police. Police sources said the boys were handed over to the Anti-terrorism Police Unit in Nairobi for further interrogation. Witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the suspects went missing on Sunday aboard a lorry with one of their recruiters. “The driver of the lorry suspected something fishy after hearing what they were discussing and stopped at a roadblock. The recruiter vanished,” he said. Click here for the latest political news
