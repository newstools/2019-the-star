A modern mobile control tower (below) to provide air navigation services to flights to and from Ukunda airstrip has been commissioned. Kenya Civil Aviation Authority director general Gilbert Kibe said the Sh150 million tower will help to deal with increased air traffic and secure the Kenyan airspace. He spoke in Ukunda on Monday. “We are investing in the safety, security and efficiency of the aviation sector. This mobile tower will mitigate against service disruptions and incidents or threats within the Kenyan air space,” Kibe said. He said Ukunda airstrip will be upgraded to an airport following installation of the mobile control tower. It will be expanded to allow bigger aircraft to land and take off. “KAA has plans to lengthen the runway from 1.2km to a stretch of 1.8km and to construct a larger terminal ,” Kibe said.
