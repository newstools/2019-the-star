Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has finally acknowledged finds it hard to express himself in English. Addressing mourners at a funeral service in Gatundu South on Saturday, Waitutu, speaking in Kikuyu, said he did not go to nursery school. “I was a student at Dagoretti High School but as you know, I have difficulty in expressing myself English. This is because I did not go to nursery school. I was one of the children that were being subjected to the test of touching your ear with your hand and if you managed, you were allowed to proceed to Class One. But English is just but a language, of importance is what is in one's mind,” he said amid cheers and laugher from the crowd. He thanked his supporters for voting him and assured them he will work to make a difference. Last year, Waititu called for rivers to be moved rather than houses on riparian land to be demolished.
