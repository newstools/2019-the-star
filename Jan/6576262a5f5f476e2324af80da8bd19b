A 12-year-old girl is hospitalised in Karachuonyo after a hippo attacked her and broke her leg yesterday morning. The girl was attacked at Chowe beach in Wang’chieng while fetching water in Lake Victoria. BMU chairman Peter Shikuku said the hippo broke the child’s right leg. “The hippo grabbed and broke the leg before she was rescued,” he said. The animal disappeared among the water hyacinth after the attack. He said there are frequent hippo attacks at the beach and urged the Kenya Wildlife Service to intervene. “Human-wildlife conflict is rampant around the beach. We appeal to authorities to help us get a solution,” Shikuku said. Senior chief Peter Agunga said they have reported the matter to police. He said they have contacted the KWS for intervention. “We hope the pupil will get well and continue with her studies. Let residents refrain from going to areas frequently invaded by hippos,” Agunga said. Click here for the latest political news
