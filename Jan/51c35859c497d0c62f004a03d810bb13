The 15th edition of Safaricom Sports Personality of the Year Awards yesterday received a Sh3 million boost from Kenya Pipeline Company towards this Friday’s gala event planned for Fort Jesus, Mombasa. While presenting the cheque to the organisers, KPC corporate communications manager, Jason Nyatino, said it’s enriching for the company to associate with Soya for the fourth year running. “This the biggest sporting event in the East African region and we are extremely proud to be part of this initiative. Over the years, KPC has been involved in promoting and nurturing talent and that is what Soya is all about— recognizing talent,” said Nyatino. He added: “We have invested heavily in sports because we believe in social economic development and sports is important in national development of the country. We now have the best women volleyball team in Africa; Kenya Pipeline, who are seven-time Africa club champions.” Soya awards brand ambassador, Douglas Wakiihuri, thanked the corporate bodies for their support over the years, It was all systems go as they head to Mombasa. “We are looking forward to having a great event in Mombasa. All nominees and guests will have great time in the coastal town. This is also a chance for Mombasa to open up for more sporting activities,” said Wakiihuri, a former runner who won marathon gold medal in the 1987 World Championships, in Rome.
