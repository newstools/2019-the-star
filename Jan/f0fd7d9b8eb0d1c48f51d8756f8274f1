A section of Bomet residents has written to the Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi seeking his intervention over "exorbitant and exploitative" fares by matatus operating in the region. The group calling itself the Bomet Residents Association expressed their concern at what they termed as unreasonable transport fee hikes by matatu operators. "The county residents request for your urgent actions to the fare hiking in Bomet which has become exorbitant and unbearable to us," read the letter to the CS seen by the Star. Travelling from Bomet-Narok, which they say used to charge Sh200 now costs Sh450 while Longisa to Bomet where it used to be Sh50 are now charging four times the previous fare. Passengers travelling from Bomet to Kericho, they claim, now pay Sh500 up from Sh250. The letter has been copied to the county commissioner, county police commander and Governor Joyce Laboso.

"We are ready to take action on the matatu saccos involved...we have asked all those with complaints to come with receipts showing they have been overcharged but, unfortunately, no one has come," Ichami said. Among the saccos using the Bomet stage and said to be overcharging are Bomet Travellers Sacco, Narok Transport Sacco and Southrift Transport Sacco. Matiang'i had issued a stern warning to all fare-hiking matatu operators that they risk losing their licenses.
