Captain Harun Shakava and Shafik Batambuze squandered their penalties as defending champions Gor Mahia were knocked out of the SportPesa Cup by Mbao FC at Dar es Salaam National Stadium. Legendary striker Dennis Oliech on Wednesday put Kogalo ahead in the 53rd minute from the spot after a Mbao defender handled in the box. Gor outplayed Mbao as Erissa Sseiksambu, whose goal was disallowed in the first half, missed several chances. Mbao pushed hard for the equaliser, hitting Gor from the counter, but found it hard to go past Gor defenders Shakava and Joash Onyango. Gor's coach Hassan Oktay was sent to the stands for exchanging words with match officials in the first half. Kogalo looked destined for the semi-finals under the command of assistant coach Zedekiah “Zico” Otieno but the home side levelled in the 77th minute. Abubakari Ngalema's shot was deflected from a corner to make it 1-1. Zico made more changes as Gor pushed for the winner. He brought in Jack Tuyisenge and Francis Kahata to sharpen the frontline. Kogalo dominated, but still could not break Mbao’s defence. Tuyisenge had a late goal ruled out for offside, as the match went into penalties after ending in a draw. Kahata, Tuyisenge and Boniface Omondi scored their spot kicks. However, Shakava’s shot was saved by Mbao's goalkeeper Metacha Mnata. Gor keeper Peter Odhiambo had stopped Ibrahim Ashimu’s effort to hand his side a 3-2 advantage. Batambuze’s penalty hit the crossbar, while Erick Mulilo hit the target to send Mbao through.
