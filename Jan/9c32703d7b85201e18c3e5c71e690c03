An AP officer on Sunday committed suicide by shooting himself in the head moments after he shot and seriously injured his girlfriend in Naivasha. During the incident, the officer attached to Kipkonyo chief’s camp in Moi Ndabi fired at her lover nineteen times with three of the bullets hitting her on the hips before he fled. Trouble started after the officer who was allegedly drunk confronted the girlfriend who operates a Mpesa shop. The two had an argument according to a witness Saul Kimani. “Thinking he had killed her, the officer retreated to the camp where he shot himself on the head and died on the spot,” Kimani said. Naivasha deputy county commissioner John Opondo confirmed the incident and said the woman had been admitted at the Naivasha subcounty hospital in serious condition.
