Musicians paid glowing tribute to legendary producer Bruce Odhiambo who died yesterday at the Nairobi Hospital. The former Youth Enterprise Development Fund chairman died after suffering a massive heart attack on Saturday. Odhiambo, who left the fund in disgrace after abuse of office allegations, was a renowned producer at Johari Clef. One of his celebrated works is the song Niache Niimbe, produced for gospel marvel Pitson. He died months after he travelled to India to seek replacement of a pacemaker that was implanted by doctors to manage his irregular heartbeats. Pitson said of Odhiambo, “You stretched me, you made me do more. You made Niache Niimbe my best arranged and played song so far. Asante sana.” Carol Radull, a radio show host, and Kenyan artists hailed him for his contribution to the music industry. “You were front and centre when we created Radio Jambo in 2008. I’ll remember you for your contribution to Kenya’s music industry. Rest in peace Bruce,” she posted on Twitter. Sauti Sol said, “RIP Bruce Odhiambo. Your immense contribution to the industry laid the foundation for many artists. You were not only a mentor, but also a dad to us all. May you rest with the angels.” Comedian Jalang’o wrote, “I dint know that call was the last one...Bruce Odhiambo how I wish I came when you called me! Now you are no more my friend. All said and done, you fought a good fight. Brother Bruce rest well.” Nonini wrote, “Some might not know Kenyan music history, but Bruce Odhiambo belonged in a band called Safari Sound where they had the best selling album of all-time. With songs like ‘Jambo Bwana’ R.I.P.”
