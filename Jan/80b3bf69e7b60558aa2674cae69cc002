Impala Saracens and Nondies will be seeking to bounce back after defeats on Match Day Five when they clash at the RFUEA ground in the highlight tie of the Kenya Cup fixtures this weekend. The league will be resuming after a one week break and the two clubs will be out to put their title campaigns back on track this afternoon. Impala fell 41-10 Kabras in their previous match while Nondies succumbed 32-13 to Quins. The Sarries have boosted their roster by signing Kenya Simbas’ backrow, Elkeans Musonye from Strathmore alongside centre Anthony Orembo and Ugandan Saul kivumbi from Heathens. Head coach Frank Dong said the trio trained with the rest of the squad last weekend and may opt to give them their debuts from the bench. Ndong expects a stern test from Nondies. “It will be a tough game. They are of the most improved teams this year and we have to be at our best. Recent matches between us has been very close in the recent past,” added Ndong. The match will be preceded by a clash between Quins and Nakuru.

Nakuru coach Mitch Ocholla said: “It will be a competitive game and it will boil down to who executes well in both attack and defence.” Leaders Kabras, who boast of a 100 percent record, host Menengai Oilers at Kakamega showground .Champions KCB have a date with Mean Machine at the Lions’ Den in Ruaraka.
