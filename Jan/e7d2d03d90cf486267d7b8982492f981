Kariobangi Sharks coach William Muluya expressed displeasure with his strikers’ wastefulness as his side settled to a goal-less draw with Mathare United in a Kenya Premier League match staged at Moi Stadium, Kasarani yesterday. The much-hyped duel dubbed Ghetto Derby ended evenly but Muluya lamented his strikers’ bluntness in front of goal as they failed to bury the match winning goal from the numerous chances created in either halves. Sharks were hotly tipped to break Mathare’s 10-match unbeaten run in the league but were undone by their finishing—an outcome which left Muluya contemplating giving his second string squad playing time as the seniors recover from fatigue. “We would have won this match by three goals but poor finishing cost us the three points. My forwards squandered clear cut chances and I am a little bit disappointed with their aggressiveness in front of goal. I have also observed that fatigue is taking toll on my starting line-up and I think it’s high time I give the Juniors playing time. The draw seemed hard to take for Mathare coach Francis Kimanzi who gave the post match interview a wide berth as he hastily left for the changing room seconds after the final whistle. Prior to kickoff, Mathare made a single change to their starting eleven which won 2-1 against Chemelil Sugar in their previous match as Kimanzi preferred youthful goalkeeper Job Ochieng for David Okello. As expected, quality passes were rife throughout the match from either sides but the defence lines worked overtime to deny the marauding strikers the chance to hit the target. Fresh from being feted as the SportPesa Cup top scorer, play-maker Duke Abuya ferried his electric performance into the match and was denied twice by the woodwork in the dying minutes of the opening half as he solely sought to prove the difference between the two sides. Elsewhere, AFC Leopards suffered a 1-0 loss to Zoo Kericho in a match staged at the Kericho Green Stadium.
