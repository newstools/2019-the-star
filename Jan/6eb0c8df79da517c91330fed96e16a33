Aging players risk being axed as Kenya Prisons teams (men and women) preparations for the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) national league intensify. Anxiety has subsequently gripped the team after a warning shot from the management last week that it will no longer be business as usual. A Source privy to a meeting last week between players and the management said senior and aging players in both genders are likely to be easy target. This comes after the men’s team lost the national league title to local nemesis General Service Unit as their women counterparts reclaimed the trophy that has been dominated by arch-rivals Kenya Pipeline since 2014. “The meeting basically was to hand the women’s team trophy to the Prison management and announce 2019 calendar. They also presented the budget to the management and generally brainstormed on the way forward for both teams,” noted the source. According to the source, It was revealed that most aging players no-longer add value to the team. “They only add up the numbers but when it comes to playing they have nothing to offer. It was made clear that some of the senior or aging players might not make it to the squad for the 2019 season,” added the source. The source said officials intend to unveil teams for the 2019 season next week and players are currently crossing their fingers. “Players are unsettled because they don’t know their fate. The women team might be hit hardest because they are over crowded. As we speak, they are over 50 players there and to tell you the truth only 25 are active,” observed the source. The source added: “I see a situation where most of the players might be send back to their working stations, while others could switch to other clubs. It’s basically a wait and see kind of situation.” Meanwhile, former champions Kenya Prisons’ men team begun their pre-season training on Monday at the Ruiru grounds ahead of the March 1 league kick-off.
