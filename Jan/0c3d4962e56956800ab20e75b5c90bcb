Athi River deputy county commissioner David Juma has instructed chiefs and their assistants to ensure all children in the subcounty go to school. Juma said the residents, including boda boda operators who are perceived as the least educated, should take their children to school so as to break the chain of poverty in their familiess. He said the operators should take advantage of the government’s free primary education and sponsored secondary schools to educate their children. “Invest in your children by educating them. Do not let them stay at home,” Juma said. The administrator spoke during a public baraza attended by over 1,000 bodaboda riders from Mlolongo division in Syokimau, Machakos county, on Saturday. He said children who sat for their KCPE examinations but fail to join secondary school together with those who hold KCSE certificates shouldjoin polytechnics for technical courses. Juma advised the operators to join Saccos so that they benefit from loans for investment. He said by joining the Saccos, they will be in a better position to benefit from the national government’s low income earners’ housing project to be effected in Mavoko through the Housing Finance Corporation. Juma lauded the bodaboda operators from Mlolongo, Syokimau, Kapa and Sabaki for working closely with the security apparatus in fighting crime. He said most of the operators are reliable police informants. Juma, however, cautioned the operators against getting involved in criminal activities. He said though most riders are law abiding, a few elements amongst them are criminals who taint the group’s image.
