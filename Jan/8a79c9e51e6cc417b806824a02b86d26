Indications are that a referendum will take place, but it should not increase the size of the government, a senator has said. Nyeri’s Ephraim Maina said on Sunday that he will support a referendum that ensured equitable distribution of resources. “We are waiting for the report from the Building Bridges Initiative committee about what Kenyans are going to say,” Maina said in Karatina town. He said some of the issues of concern are corruption and wastage of resources. The senator said the referendum should be for the good of Wanjiku and not to create a big government and big offices that are not answerable to the people. “It is not a question of which office or who will hold which office. Offices may be created for the reason that will make people feel that they are not included if they do not see one of them near the top,” the legislator said. Such offices will only help in squandering of the taxpayers’ resources, the senator said and cautioned that Kenyans should be left to discuss the referendum, what they want changed and vote for it so that their issues can be addressed. He called on Kenyans to ensure that the executive is all inclusive. He said that revenue sharing should not be based on the size of the region. “You don’t give money because there are large tracts of land with some antelopes,” the senator added.
