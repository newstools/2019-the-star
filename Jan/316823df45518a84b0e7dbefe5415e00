Former Makueni MCAs have come out to defend Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka against attacks by the three Ukambani governors. The over 30 MCAs were all sent home during the 2017 general election after a fallout with the county boss Kivutha Kibwana. Kibwana, Charity Ngilu (Kitui) and Alfred Mutua of Machakos have been bashing Kalonzo over his development record, saying he should leave the region's politics to new faces. Led by former deputy speaker Caroline Munanie, the MCAs said Kibwana should leave Wiper for undermining its leadership. "We are the rightful owners of Wiper and since Kibwana wants to leave he should resign in his position," Munanie spoke during a meeting attended by the former MCAs in Malili. Munanie who was representative of Kiimakiu/Kalonzoni said Kibwana needs Kalonzo to have a sizeable number of people attend his political rally. The County Budget Implementation Review Report (CBIRR) named Makueni county among the 24 counties that spend zero shillings on development. "He (Kibwana) said that MCAs were his problem but a report has shown that Makueni spent zero shillings on development in the last financial year," she added.
