ActionAid is promoting girls’ education in Garissa and fighting FGM and child marriage. Actionaid regional coordinator Yussuf Abdi yesterday said many girls are out of school while an unknown number are facing harmful cultural practices such as female genital mutilation. He said the aim of the programme, Leave No Girl Behind, is to reduce violence against girls by empowering women’s groups and duty bearers, changing attitudes and increasing justice for survivors. “Women and girls are disadvantaged in society because they are not involved in decision making and inheritance, among others,” he said. It aims to increase school enrollment. The programme was launched by Garissa Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane. He said women must be ready to challenge stereotypes, stand up and question outdated ideas that hinder their growth.“We must remove barriers that stand on the way of women to progress. When we stand together, we can achieve anything and any obstacle can be pulled down,” he said. Education committee chair Diriye Bare said they are drafting stringent laws to punish parents who don’t enrol their children in school.
