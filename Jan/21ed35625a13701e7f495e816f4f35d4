A policewoman is nursing serious injuries after she was stabbed several times by a gangster at the weekend in Kayole. Caroline Waithera was returning home minutes past midnight on Saturday when she was confronted by the attacker. He stabbed her in the  head, chest and shoulder with a knife. Waithera was rushed to Mama Lucy Hospital where police said she is in stable condition. Police have launched investigations into the attack. Earlier, police gunned down three suspected gangsters near Mihango AP camp within Kayole.  Detectives said the suspects were being trailed following a public tip-off that they were on mission to commit robbery. Last week, four suspected robbers were gunned down in Parklands. Police said they were behind the killing of a cleric in Kinoo a week earlier.
