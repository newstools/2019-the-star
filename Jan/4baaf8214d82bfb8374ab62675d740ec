Opposition Chief Raila Odinga on Wednesday met with Nominated Senator Beth Mugo at his Capitol Hill offices for some “catching up”. The Senator was accompanied by another of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s cousin, Ngengi Muigai. “I was happy to catch up with longtime friends Senator Beth Mugo and Mr Ngengi Muigai. The three of us have a long history dating back to the struggle for multiparty politics and a new Constitution in the 1990s,” Raila said in a tweet. Mugo and Raila previously served in the same Cabinet during former presidents Daniel Moi and Mwai Kibaki's era. Raila was the Prime Minister in the latter's regime. Until the March 9, 2018 handshake between Raila and Uhuru, Mugo was one of Raila’s harshest critics. The AU High Representative for Infrastructure Development has since the truce met several close associates of the Jubilee administration in the spirit of Building Bridges. The latest of such meetings was with Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru at Capitol Hill on November 23 last year. The meeting elicited a lot of debate compared to other meetings considering their bitter fall out in 2015 over the NYS scandal when Waiguru was Devolution CS. Raila linked Waiguru to the loss of Sh791 million at the NYS and demanded that she takes responsibility. She sued Raila but the duo buried the hatchet during the rare meeting. Former Kiambu Governor William Kabogo, Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria and 2013 presidential contender Peter Kenneth are among other politicians who paid Raila a visit at Capitol Hill.
