Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa has accused Mombasa governor Hassan Joho of being behind the push to expel her from ODM. “ODM should stop joking. I was in ODM by choice; I was arrested because of [ODM leader] Raila [Odinga]. In Coast, the deputy party leader Ali Hassan Joho has been silent since the intimidation began," she said. Jumwa spoke on Wednesday during a meeting to share her development achievements with residents. ODM's disciplinary committee in December 2018 recommended the expulsion of Jumwa and Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori for supporting Deputy President William Ruto's 2022 bid. However, Raila assured them of a fair hearing. Jumwa expressed disappointment at Joho's silence as the disciplinary committee "intimidates" her. She said she vigorously campaigned for ODM in 2017. A row is now simmering between Kilifi and Mombasa leaders. Kilifi North MP Owen Baya, Woman Representative Gertrude Mbeyu and Jubilee Nominated Senator Christine Zawadi said Joho should not interfere with Kilifi politics. Jumwa questioned why Joho has never pushed for action against Migori governor Okoth Obado for supporting the DP. “In five years, ODM should not ask me where I will go. I will have finished their contract," she said. The MP said ODM should also call for the expulsion Joho for meeting Baringo Senator Gideon Moi because he is not in ODM. She said her 2022 decision to support Ruto was final, though she said she is still in ODM in the meantime. Baya said, “If they see Coast people waking up they begin intimidating them." Zawadi urged ODM to stop intimidating Jumwa. Click here for the latest political news
