Nairobi governor Miko Sonko has said he has evidence to show that former Education executive Janet Ouko who resigned on Monday engaged in corruption activities. Sonko while addressing the media in Mombasa on Wednesday said Ouko misused bursary funds meant for needy Nairobi students. The governor alleged that the CEC colluded with other cartels to operate an illegal account where county funds were channelled through. "The former CEC and her staff have been issuing bursary cheques to Obudhe education centre since during Evans Kidero era. In total Sh10 million for the 2017-2018 got lost under her watch,' Sonko said. But in a rejoinder, Ouko dismissed the claims as false and invited the EACC to probe the allegations. During a press conference at City Hall on Monday, Janet said she felt it was time for her to pursue and focus on "other issues". She had said she had a good working relationship with Sonko, but changed tune on Wednesday. Click here for the latest political news
