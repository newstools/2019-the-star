Ford Kenya party has dismissed claims by its deputy leader Bonnie Khalwale that it entered into a MoU to support DP William Ruto in 2022. Secretary-General Eseli Simiyu termed Khalwale's sentiments as "personal and not those of the party". During an interview on Thursday in a local TV station, Khalwale alleged that Ford Kenya has decided to back Ruto's presidential bid in 2022. The former Kakamega senator challenged Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetangula, SG Simiyu Eseli, legislators Chris Wamalwa and Wafula Wamunyinyi to openly confirm or deny the existence of such a pact. But addressing parents, teachers and students of Salvation Army school, Makunga on Friday in his Tongaren constituency Eseli asked Khalwale to make public the said MoU. Eseli was handing over a cheque of Sh 4.5 million for construction of a twin laboratory. The construction of the laboratory is funded by Harambee Holland Foundation. 'I have heard comments regarding a MoU that does not exist and I was very perplexed on where Khalwale got that from,' he said. Eseli asked Khalwale to desist from making such outrageous comments about the party. "The Ford Kenya party management committee met on Thursday and are reviewing the complaints on how to take disciplinary actions against him,' he said.
