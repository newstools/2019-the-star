A WhatsApp group yesterday marked five years since its formation in a get-together party and community service through donations to support the needy in the community. ‘Tigania West Elites’ was started by university students and grew to accommodate businesspersons, leaders, and opinion leaders, among others. They registered Mt Kenya Sacco. Last week, they gave Sh120,000 to the needy at Coscity Gardens in Tigania East, Meru. Although only 30 are registered in the sacco, 200 members attended the end of year party. “We contributed to enjoy Christmas by sharing. The group has earned respect for it’s numerous achievements. Earlier, we had formal meetings before 2017 and members took different political inclinations. The group has, however, managed to help many needy cases in the community,” Mitheka Harrison, the founder of the group, told the Star. The group also checks on area leaders by championing for development and appointments to the county and national governments. Mitheka said they have sponsored a bright needy girl in secondary since January last year. Mitheka and members, however, accused the county government leadership of negligence over the deplorable condition of Kianjai market. “Kianjai market is very dirty to an extent of exposing traders to diseases. We appeal to governor Kiraitu Murungi and to improve standards of this market,” he said.
