Kisii leaders have praised President Uhuru Kenyatta for giving Interior CS Fred Matiang’i more powers. In a Gazette notice, the President said the CS will be in charge of the National Development Implementation and Communication Cabinet Committee. The new role elevates Matiang’i above other Cabinet secretaries. The committee will monitor development projects initiated and funded by the national government. Yesterday, Kisii governor James Ongwae said the CS merited the appointment. He spoke to the press at his office. Ongwae said Matiang’i had demonstrated that he is committed to transformative leadership in all the dockets he has led. “On behalf of the people of Kisii, I thank the President for his commitment to the realisation of the Big Four agenda and recognising Matiang’i’s service to citizens,” he said. Ongwae urged Kenyans to support the Big Four Agenda — universal healthcare, manufacturing, food security and affordable housing. Leaders present included assembly Majority leader Timothy Ogugu, Minority leader James Ondari, deputy Majority leader Josephine Ombati and deputy speaker Davins Onuso.
