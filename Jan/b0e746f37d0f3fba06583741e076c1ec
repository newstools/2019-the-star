Raila Odinga's change of tactic was bound to happen. He could not go to the handshake with the same people, who — from the 1963 from his father Jaramogi Oginga's point of view — saw the state as an enemy. All his lieutenants, Raila himself, saw the state as an oppressor until March 9, when Raila Odinga changed. He now wants to say the state is a beautiful girl. This is dramatic and traumatising that many of his followers would have died had they gone to the table to meet Uhuru Kenyatta, an epitome - to them - of hatred, deceit, betrayal. Raila picked Suna East MP Junet Mohamed, a non-entity in the hierarchy of ODM or NASA to accompany him. He could not face the Orengos (Siaya senator James Orengo) or the Migunas (lawyer Miguna Miguna), people who have suffered and lost their property, careers because of his political career. He had to go with someone who had not been hurt such as Miguna. Secondly, Uhuru is uncomfortable with some elements intelligence reports indicate are likely to scuttle the handshake. Orengo is among those angling for post-Raila period. If Raila exits the political circle, who takes over that constituency? It is a vicious battle. Raila is very guarded, and he will not want to disclose anything. However, him and his father have a track record of over trusting the Mt Kenya brigade. Every time, Jaramogi trusted Kenyatta, he detained him. President Mwai Kibaki failed to endorse him soon after the grand coalition term ended. It is also likely that by 2021, Uhuru will have disengaged from Raila. That is why Raila is isolating himself. Y&ou should ask, Is Raila 100 percent trusting President Kenyatta? I'd say he is not. From the past records, he knows politics is not a game of trust. It is a game of interest and for now, the interest is handshake. In my view, Raila finds himself in a situation he cannot trust anybody other than Junet, his daughter and Ida.
