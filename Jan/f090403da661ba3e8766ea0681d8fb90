This year’s Kenya Volleyball Federation national league risk featuring few teams after a number them failed to show up for registration during the technical meeting over the weekend. Only 10 men and six women’s confirmed participated this year as compared to 16 men and 10 women’s teams last year. KVF organising secretary, Ismail Chege, said they had no choice but to draft fewer teams in the league because they are the only ones that showed up. The official, however, said there is still room for those teams willing to be part of the season as the league is set to serve of on March 1. “For now, only 11 men and six women’s teams turned up for the registration. But we remain hopefully that other teams will join the league before the season throws off,” he noted. Among the teams that are yet to register and were part of the last season league are Bomet, Kericho, Kiambu counties, Kahawa and Naks (men) and Ashton, Bomet , Kahawa and Western Bombers in the women’s category. Western Bombers, who have pulled out of the women’s league said they will still play in the KVF Open tournaments. Bombers team manager Silas Cheren said as much as they will not field a team in the league, they will ensure western is well represented. “It’s unfortunate Western Bombers will not be part of the league this season but we hope to make a come-back in future. It’s a self-sponsored team but one thing I know is that we will feature open tournaments,” said Cheren. He added: “For now, we will help beef up Bungoma County team to ensure we have a strong team from western.”
