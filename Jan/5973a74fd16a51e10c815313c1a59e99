Three men have been arrested for fraudulently obtaining money from unsuspecting Kenyans along the Narok-Bomet Highway. Saini Rajipal, Samson Mahara and George Mwanthi were nabbed on Monday evening with the false promise that they were to sell to the complainants an antique iron box that allegedly contained Mercury. They will be charged with attempting to obtain money by false pretences. The Director of Criminal Investigations tweeted this on Tuesday midday. In December, three people impersonating DCI detectives were arrested for lying to the CEO of the Teachers Service Commission and attempting to extort money for some 'purported investigations'.
