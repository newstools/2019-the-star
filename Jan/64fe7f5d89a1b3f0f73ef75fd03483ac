Ruto said the efforts aimed at bringing all Kenyans together irrespective of their ethnic and political affiliations. The DP was speaking on Sunday at the African Inland Church (AIC), Pipeline in Embakasi South, Nairobi where he said it is only through peace and unity that the country can achieve its development targets. “We want to engage in activities that can address the cost of living among Kenyans, manage the cost of health and create employment opportunities for our youths through the implementation of the Big Four agenda," Ruto said.
