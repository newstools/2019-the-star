A teacher in Nakuru West has died after he was allegedly attacked by two students for confiscating their mobile phone. Police are also holding a third suspect in connection with the murder. Peter Omare, the physics teacher at Hopewell High School was attacked while on his way to his house located within the compound. The three were arrested at a nearby homestead known for selling illicit brews and drugs. The school administration said one of the students was from the same school while the other from a neighbouring one. The teacher was supervising evening studies on Thursday and was attacked as he walked to his house. Area Chief David Kerui said the teacher was hit on the head with a blunt object that opened up his skull. "He died a few minutes before we could rush him to the hospital,” Kirui said. Learning was paralysed at the institution on Friday as learners and teachers come to terms with the gruesome murder. The school director Vitalis Kahenda said the teacher had at around 6 pm confiscated a mobile phone from a student whom he spotted receiving it from two outsiders through the fence. “He had shared information on the confiscated mobile phone but had not yet handed it over to the management since it was late. The school policy is such phones are confiscated and handed over to the administration,” said Kahenda. Nakuru OCPD Samuel Obara confirmed the three suspects were being held at Rhonda Police Station pending investigations. “Several people have recorded statements on the matter and we have launched investigations. The suspects will be arraigned in court the soonest possible,” Obara said. Click here for the latest political news
