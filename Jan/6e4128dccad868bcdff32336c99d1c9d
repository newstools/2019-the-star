Good Morning. Former PS Lillian Omollo and her co-accused manipulated the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS) to embezzle public funds, the court heard yesterday.

For instance, several title deeds in possession of those claiming 11,551 acres were generated December 31, 2002. This was during the dramatic end to President Daniel Moi's 24-year stranglehold on Kenya's politics. _____________________________________________________ Alarm as 24 counties spend zero on development The Controller of Budget has revealed that some 24 counties have not spent a penny on development activities during the current financial year.

The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common.
