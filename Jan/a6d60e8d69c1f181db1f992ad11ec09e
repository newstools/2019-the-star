Kenya Sevens skipper Jacob Ojee believes Shujaa will have to improve on their defensive play if they are to realise their dream of reaching this weekend’s Hamilton Sevens main cup quarter-finals. The Simbas’ winger, who is making a return to the side after a five-year hiatus, said poor alignment and positioning was the side’s main undoing during the first two legs of the World Series in Dubai and Cape Town. “If we get our defence right and avoid conceding soft tries, we will be in a good position to make it to the cup quarterfinals,” said Ojee. Shujaa succumbed to a number of huge defeats in the opening two legs, going down 43-12 and 38-7 to Fiji in both legs, 35-14 to Scotland and 29-12 to England. Shujaa are in Pool ‘C’ in Hamilton and open their campaign against champions South Africa, followed by Scotland while France await in the final preliminary match. Ojee said he is relishing the challenge of facing South Africa in the opener. “We have nothing to be afraid of if we do the basics right. We are not going to the event as participants but to leave a mark,” added Ojee Ojee lauded the efforts made by the rookies, who are stepping into the shoes of the senior players, who have refused to train owing to contractual dispute with union. “The young players are learning from us and have shown the hunger and desire to compete,” he noted. The team arrived in New Zealand on Monday and have been undergoing full training sessions for the past two days. Kenya currently lie 14th with four points and Ojee remains optimistic that they will avoid relegation. “I’m confident we won’t be relegated. Instead, we will move up the table and finish in a respectable position come the end of the season,” added Ojee.
