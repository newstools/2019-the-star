A man has pleaded guilty to charges of lying to police that he was a member of al Shabaab. Kelvin Kitili Julius, alias Omar Ali Ibrahim, on Wednesday told the court he made the confession while under the influence of bhang. Kitili also lied on January 1 that he and "other terrorists" were planning to attack vital installations in Nairobi. He was charged with hoaxing and giving false information to a person employed by the public service. The man was also charged with claiming that he had travelled to Somalia. He will be sentenced later on Wednesday. This comes as police are holding eight suspects suspected to have facilitated the terrorists that executed the attack at the Dusit hotel and business complex on 14 Riverside Drive on January 15, killing 21 people.
