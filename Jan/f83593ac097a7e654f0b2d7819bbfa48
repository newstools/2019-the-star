World Under 20 10,000m champion Rhonex Kipruto and Brilliant Jepkorir dominated the 28th edition of Discovery Kenya Cross country championships held at the Eldoret Sports Club yesterday. Kipruto won the 10km title after beating World Under 20 5,000m champion Edward Zakayo to second as the youngsters capitalised on the absence of top runners who opted to seek tickets to the national championships-cum trails at their respective affiliates. Kipruto clocked 30:40.3 with Zakayo five seconds slower at 30:46.9 while defending Josephat Kipchirchir took the final podium slot in 30:50.5. Nicholas Kimeli (30:50.5), Moses Kibet (31:04.9) and Erick Kiptoo (28:36.9) completed the top six places. “The weather was too hot but winning today was a great achievement for me and my coach. My target is to compete at world cross country championships. I knew the challenge would be stiff and but I was prepared for it,” said Kipruto. “I thought I would beat Kipruto since he just returned home after running abroad but he proved too strong, which provided for a healthy competition,” said the Africa 5,000m champion. Jepkorir returned into limelight with her win in 8km senior women’s race, adding to her last weekend’s Elgeyo Marakwet County championships. She timed 27:36.1 ahead of Beatrice Chepkemoi (27:42.5), Dorcas Chepchirchir (27:47.9), Valary Jemeli (27:53.2), Rachael Chebet (28:09.6) and Lydia Njeri (28:36.9). World under 20 5,000m champion Beatrice Chebet defeated her counterpart, world under 18 800m silver medalist Lydia Jeruto to claim 6km junior women’s title as upstart Michael Kibet outshone Joseph Muigai to win 8km junior men. Chebet from Londiani clocked 20:53.9 ahead of Jeruto (21:06.6) as Caren Chebet, the world under 18 2,000m steeplechase champion finished third in 21:20.5.Janet Chepkoech (21:20.6), Winnie Kimutai (21:31.8) and Feliciana Kanda (21:38.9) completed the top six finishers.
