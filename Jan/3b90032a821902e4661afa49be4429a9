Assembly Majority leader Abdi Guyo has urged residents to give Governor Mike Sonko time for consultation to come up with a strong nominee for deputy. On Friday Sonko had been expected to name his deputy, as he had promised. But he deferred the nomination, citing consultations with the Opposition coalition Nasa. The Matopeni MCA said people should not rush Sonko to name his deputy. He said that under the Constitution, the deputy governor does not play a vital role. The County Governments Act states: “The governor may assign the deputy governor any other responsibility or portfolio as a member of the county executive committee.” The Constitution says theat when the governor is absent, the deputy governor becomes acting governor. “We are pushing Sonko to name someone who lawfully does not play a huge role. A deputy governor cannot be answerable to Nairobians If there is no delivery. If there is no development, Nairobi voters have a right to question the governor,” Guyo said on Saturday.
