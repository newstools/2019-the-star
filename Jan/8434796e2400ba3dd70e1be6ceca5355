More than 100 children were defiled in the area during the festive season. The Director for the Center for Human Rights and Democracy Kipkorir Ngetich said they had recorded a high number of similar cases inthe December holidays. He also said many such cases went unreported. “Cases of defilement and other abuses against children are so alarming in this region and there is need for action,” Ngetich said and accused both the police and the public of poorly handing child abuse cases. “In most of the cases, suspects end up being freed,” he said and called for action to be taken against parents who opted to “kangaroo courts”. Uasin Gishu county commissioner Abdi Hassan said police officers had been directed to handle cases involving children with seriousness. “Children are protected by the law and we will not allow anyone to mess up with them. The law will be applied fully.” Hassan said there had been a high drop-out rate of schoolgirls due to early pregnancies.
