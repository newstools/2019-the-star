Kenya Premier League champions Gor Mahia have turned down Sh1.5million bid from Ethiopian giants St. George to sell Humphrey Mieno. According to sources the Ethiopian club had tabled a transfer fee of Sh1.5m to sign the Kenyan player but Gor Mahia have categorically refused to let go Mieno. A source privy to the transfer said: “St. George had officially enquired from Gor Mahia for the services of Mieno and even tabled a Sh1.5million offer to sign the player but Gor Mahia have declined any negotiations.” However, a top K’Ogalo official has now confirmed that the club is not keen to release Mieno, who has one year left on his contract. “We are not fools to keep letting go our best players. What I saw from St. George’s is a letter asking us to do business on Mieno but we are not ready for that,” he said. “We have a Caf Confederation Cup match coming up on January 13 and it will not be fair for us to start weakening the team. Whatever they want to pay, we are not interested. The club (St. George) should look elsewhere for new players and not at Gor Mahia. We are not selling any player for now,” he added. Should Mieno join St. George’s, he will link up with Harambee Stars goalkeeper Patrick Matasi, who signed for the side from Tusker. St. George’s are handled by Stewart Hall, who also coached Mieno at Sofapaka and Azam of Tanzania.
