Three people were yesterday charged with the theft of 10 vehicles in Nairobi and Kajiado. Nahashon Ayiecha, alias Kindler, Peter Njuguna, alias Ndingo and Caleb Aluanga, alias Macho were arrested in Silanga, Kibra, last week. They allegedly drugged motorists and security guards in estates using stupefying drugs before stealing the vehicles. Detectives from Lang’ata are said to have found the suspects with a bottle containing nine tablets of Roche Valium and tools used to break into vehicles. Some of the drugged security guards were found sleeping hours after the drugs was administered and vehicles stolen from estates. Others were found unconscious after they were beaten and seriously wounded. Ayiecha, Njuguna and Aluanga are facing more than 20 counts, including conspiracy to commit felonies and stealing vehicles. They were also charged with preparation to commit felony in which they are accused of administering the stupefying drugs to several motorists and security guards. Their charges are contained in four different files. They denied the charges before senior resident magistrate Hellen Okwani. Okwani freed them on Sh600,000 bond with a surety of a similar amount each. Alternatively they could deposit Sh200,000 bail for every case filed. A suspected accomplice was arrested in Kirinyaga last year after a stolen car was tracked to his home. He denied the charges when he appeared before a Milimani court last year. Lang’ata DCI chief Samson Kiptum yesterday said the cases will be consolidated for a joint trial.
