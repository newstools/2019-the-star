Justice is delayed in the Mbita law courts on Rusinga Island, with only one prosecutor and he’s on sick leave. The courts serve Suba North and Suba South constituencies of Homa Bay county. A court official who spoke on condition of anonymity yesterday said Mbita law courts have 90 suspects remanded at Homa Bay prison. The official said the courts have one prosecutor who is currently on sick leave and needs surgery. The prosecutor has not been at work since January 7. “A prosecutor brings suspects officially to court for criminal and traffic offences. A magistrate cannot handle such cases in absence of a prosecutor,” the official said. Currently, most suspects are taken to court in Homa Bay town, which is 42km from Mbita. The official said lack of a prosecutor in the court is an obstacle to accessing justice. “Many residents are now forced to travel more than 70km to seek justice. This problem is a deterrent for those who seek justice,” the official added. “We are appealing to the DPP Noordin Haji to intervene in this matter urgently.” Resident Okuku Miregi, who is a witness in a case, said the hearing has been put off indefinitely because a prosecutor is not available. “The hearing on January 24 never took place due to lack of a prosecutor. The magistrate said the case will be rescheduled once a prosecutor is posted to the court,” Miregi said. Mbita activist Jack Okinyi said many suspects are langushing in remand due to lack of prosecutors. Okinyi said many other suspects are in police custody. He spoke to journalists in Mbita town on Monday. “Many suspects suffer in remand due to this problem. There should be a way of dealing with it,” Okinyi said. However, Homa Bay senior assistant director of public prosecutions Ammon Oluoch said the DPP is dealing with the matter.“The issue is being solved. No cause for alarm,” Oluoch said.
