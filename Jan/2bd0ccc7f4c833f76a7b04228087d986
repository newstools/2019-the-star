Some Garissa MCAs yesterday threatened to challenge the recruitment of mapping clerks for the August census in court. Daud Aadan of Danyere, Adan Abaile of Balambala, Kassim Dagane of Saka and Hussein Mohamed (nominated) – said they were unhappy with how the exercise was conducted. They spoke to the press outside the assembly. The recruitment of the 59 clerks started late last November and ended in December. The training started on Thursday. Hussein said they are still gathering evidence for a strong case against the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. “It is unfortunate that our youth, who are competent and met all the qualifications, were left out and people from outside were picked for the job,” she said. Hussein said efforts to have the recruitment drive repeated have been unsuccessful as those tasked with it cannot be accessed either by phone or physically. Daud claimed the process was marred with corruption. “It is an open secret that the exercise lacked public participation as enshrined in the Constitution,” he said. Efforts to get a comment from Garissa county statistics officer Khatra Dahir by phone were unsuccessful. A source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the statistics officer has been receiving phone calls from local leaders who want “their people” to be listed.
