The standoff at the National Social Security Fund which stopped the pensions agency from holding meetings has been resolved. Labour Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani reappointed Cotu boss Francis Atwoli and Federation of Kenya Employees executive director Jacqueline Mugo back to the NSSF board. The gazette notice on their appointment shows that their three-year terms began on January 18. Atwoli on Thursday confirmed his appointment and thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for ending the row. In October last year, the Labour Court stopped the NSSF board from holding meetings following a dispute over its composition.
