The body of a boda boda rider was on Monday found dumped in a trench in Mai Mahiu trading centre, Naivasha. The man, only known as Njuguna, went missing on Saturday. His body was found by sand harvesters heading to work. Resident James Kamau said the rider had recently bought a new motorcycle and had ferried a customer before going missing. He said Njuguna had complained of being followed. “His motorcycle was stolen and he had marks on the neck, suggesting he might have been strangled,” Kamau said. Residents have raised concern about attacks on boda boda riders. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru said the body was taken to the Naivasha Subcounty Hospital mortuary. “We have opened an inquest file and handed over the matter to our DCI officers who have started investigations,” he said. Meanwhile, one of the bodies from an accident involving a motorcyclist and his passenger on Saturday has been identified as that of a former journalist based in Nakuru town. Kelvin Njuguna, popularly known as Kel Wesh, was on his way back to Naivasha town when he was hit by a motorist near Three Point along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. The motorcycle rider also died at the scene, while the occupants of the vehicle heading to Nakuru sustained minor injuries. Click here for the latest political news
