Friends and relatives of Ali Salim Gichunge have expressed shock after learning the man who left home in 2015 was involved in the Dusit terrorist attack. They said Gichunge was born and bred in Kulamawe, Bulapesa ward of Isiolo county. He was described as God fearing, loving and outgoing person who never took alcohol or drugs. Gichunge's childhood friend Moses Kinyua said he was one class ahead of him at Hekima Primary School in Isiolo. He said Gichunge was bright and is dismayed at the news that his friend was involved in terrorism. Kinyua sent a message of condolence to the families of the victims of the attack and wished the injured a quick recovery. Waso location chief James Chuchu said Gichungeâ€™s family lived peacefully with neighbours. He said he has never received a complaint about any member. He said Gichunge's father works for the Kenya Defence Forces. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations officers arrested Gichunge's mother Sakina Mariam. She was questioned at the Isiolo Anti Terror Police Unit offices and later taken to Nairobi for further interrogation. The people who spoke sought anonymity for fear of victimisation after Miriam's arrest. Read: Taveta family mourns GSU officer killed in Dusit terror attack Click here for the latest political news
