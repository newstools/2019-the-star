An influential Congolese organisation that had denounced December's presidential elections as fraudulent says it will not call for further protests challenging the result. The CLC coalition of lay Roman Catholic leaders has told the BBC that following the inauguration last week of Felix Tshisekedi, it will not back demonstrations opposing him. One of Tshisekedi's rivals, Martin Fayulu, insists the poll was rigged. But correspondents say he will find it difficult to mobilise support without the backing of the Catholic Church. The CLC was instrumental in calling mass demonstrations against former President Joseph Kabila, who stepped down after 18 years in office. It was the first peaceful transfer of power in the country in nearly 60 years. Click here for the latest political news
