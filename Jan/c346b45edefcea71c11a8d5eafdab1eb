Macadamia farmers and traders in Embu have threatened to hold demonstrations to protest non-payment of Sh55 million for produce delivered to processors. Farmers took their macadamia to the factories in November, December and January and were to be paid upon delivery. However, they were asked to wait for a few logistics in the processing of their payment. "We're very disappointed that months later, we have not been paid. The nonpayment has greatly inconvenienced us," John Kathangu said. Kathangu is the deputy chairman of the Nut Traders Association of Kenya. He spoke at a press conference in Embu town on Saturday. "Most of us are unable to take their children to school because things haven't gone according to plan," he said. Kathangu said the association will call for a protest to force the processors to pay up. Most of the factories are based in Embu. Kathangu said the association will also protest against blocking of Chinese buyers who offer better prices. "It is sad that our local factories have formed a cartel to prevent Chinese buyers from accessing the market so they can continue exploiting farmers," Kathangu said. He asked the local buyers to accept competition with the foreigners for the growth of the industry. "We're also concerned about lies by some processors who are asking farmers to buy seedlings yet they know the seedlings canâ€™t thrive without rain," Kathangu said. Most macadamia farmers don't irrigate their farms.
