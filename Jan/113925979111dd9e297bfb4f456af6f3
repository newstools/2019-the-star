Preliminary results from Democratic Republic of Congoâ€™s presidential election may be delayed past Sunday because of the low number of voting tally sheets received so far, the head of the electoral commission, CENI, told candidates on Wednesday. CENI president Corneille Nangaa said that by Wednesday, vote counting centers had received just 17 percent of tally sheets, three sources who were present told Reuters.
