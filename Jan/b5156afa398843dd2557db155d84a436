Garissa leaders have criticised the government for withholding results of schools from the region over cheating allegations. Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed, while releasing KCSE results last month, said some were withheld pending investigations into claims of irregularities. Amina said the Kenya National Examinations Council will release a report on the probe on or before January 31. It is not yet clear how many schools have been affected in Mandera, Wajir and Garissa counties. Among those whose results were withheld are Busra High, Nanighi, Ikhlas, Al azhar, Dertu Girls’, Young Muslim, Garissa Private, Sankuri, Hajji Girls’, Hulugho Girls’, Hulugho Boys and Huda, all in Garissa. Yesterday leaders said the move to withhold the results is insensitive and was ill informed. Speaking to the Star separately, the leaders who included Fafi MP Abdikarim Osman, Garissa Knut executive Abdirizack Hussein and Garissa peace secretary Hassan Osman asked Knec to “immediately release the results.” “How can they do this to the students who worked so hard over the years,” Osman said. He dismissed the cheating allegations saying the exam was strictly supervised. “We are calling on the CS to unconditionally release the results,” the MP said. Abdirizack said the students could be disillusioned and forced to join radical groups if Knec decides to cancel their results. “Desperate parents have been calling us everyday about the results yet we have no answers. We hope to hear from the authorities soon,” Abdirazack said.
