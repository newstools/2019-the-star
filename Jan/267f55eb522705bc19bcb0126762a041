Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong’o’s press unit has denied reports he has been flown out of the country for treatment. Aloice Ager, the Governor Press Unit director, on Sunday termed the reports untrue and malicious. “We have seen all sorts of reports on social media that the governor has been taken out of the country for treatment. Such information is false and should be dismissed,” Ager said. There were reports Nyong'o had been flown to South Africa. But sources close to him claimed that he was flown to meet his specialist doctor in Nairobi. Nyong’o was on Saturday rushed to Aga Khan Hospital in Kisumu after falling ill during the installation of the new Archbishop of Kisumu, Rev Philip Anyolo, at the Uzima University grounds. Ager said the governor is in better health and was discharged on Saturday evening. He said Nyong’o was headed to Nairobi to attend the Council of Governors meeting on Monday where they will elect new officials. Ager on Saturday said following a discomfort while attending the function, Nyong'o excused himself to seek medical attention. “He was diagnosed with a sudden drop of blood pressure. His doctor has prescribed a brief bed rest as the pressure is stabilised. The Governor is in a stable condition," the statement read. ODM party leader Raila Odinga and his sister Ruth Odinga visited Nyong'o in hospital. Click here for the latest political news
