The family of the strongest man in Kenya is calling upon the county and the national government to offer them financial support to accord their loved one a decent burial. The late Conrad Njeru Karukenya, popularly known as Tiger Power died on Tuesday at Consolata mission hospital Kyeni in Embu East from a pre-existing heart condition. “We are calling on his fans, the Embu County Government and the national Government to help us arrange his funeral and give him a decent burial,” Tiger's sister-in-law Margaret Muthoni told Word Is on Friday. His son, Boniface Njeru said that their father had no other source of income apart from pulling jaw-dropping stunts at public functions. "He had stopped performing due to his deteriorating state of health," said Njeru. A family member who sought anonymity told Word Is that Power had not built himself a permanent house. "He was always on the move, I guess a proper house was not his priority," said the relative. Date of the burial is yet to be set.
