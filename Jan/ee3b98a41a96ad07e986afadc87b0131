A joint effort between the public and the police has seen a sharp drop in crime in Limuru sub county in Kiambu county. Deputy county commissioner David Kiprop said there were no theft cases reported in the holiday season. He applauded residents for assisting security officials patrolling the area, with information. “We appreciate the support we received from the public, the information we shared helped us to conduct successful patrols and so we were able to ensure no criminal had a chance,” Kiprop said. A Nyumba Kumi official Miriam Nduta revealed that the killings they witnessed had caused tension to residents. “We had two people killed in Limuru and especially in Tarambana area; Veterinary doctor Kimani Njeng’ere and the security guard Beth Chebet,” she said. Area MP Peter Mwathi assisted the administration police to repair a broken down land cruiser which had stalled for the last six years. “The land cruiser has been grounded, but now it working and we are happy since we have seen the fruits of repairing it,” the MP said.
