Eight secondary schoolgirls were on Saturday arrested for loitering in Maralal town. They were found hanging around nightclubs in school uniform at around 2am. Samburu Central police boss Abagaro Guyo told the Star on Saturday before their arrest, the girls were on their way back to school after the holiday. "We arrested the girls who were hanging around nightclubs. They had left their belonging in a bus and were loitering in town at 2am," he said. Guyo told parents to mind the security of their children and especially schoolgirls. "At such an hour, the town is full of people with evil intentions. It takes only minutes to mess a girl child's life," he said. Samburu Woman Representative Maison Leshoomo asked parents to be escorting their children to school to avoid such incidences. But some resident appealed to the police to be lenient with the children. "Students travelling to Nyahururu from here use buses that operate at night," a resident said.
