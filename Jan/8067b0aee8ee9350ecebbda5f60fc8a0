Egypt will host the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, the Confederation of African Football (Caf) has announced. Egypt beat South Africa, the only other nation to bid, by 16 votes to one with one abstention at a Caf executive committee vote in Dakar, Senegal. Original host nation Cameroon was stripped of staging duties in November because of slow preparations. Egypt, has just six months to prepare for the expanded 24-team finals, which kick off in June. It will be the fifth time Egypt has hosted the tournament, the most recent was in 2006. Caf has since offered Cameroon the chance to stage the finals in two years’ time, which has meant that the original hosts for both the 2021 and 2023 finals have been asked to delay their tournaments. Caf had originally planned to name the new hosts on Wednesday 9 January. Ivory Coast, which was set to host the 2021, has protested against the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Guinea’s football federation announced on Monday that it has agreed to move its staging of the Nations Cup from 2023 to 2025. It will be the first time there will be 24 teams at the tournament and Caf, after several inspection visits over the last two years, said Cameroon would not be ready in time. Egypt has extensive football facilities, although in recent years attendances at local matches have been restricted because of security concerns following the Arab Spring revolution and Tahrir Square demonstrations in 2011. The final round of qualifiers for the tournament will be held in March, with 14 nations, including Egypt, having already sealed their place at the finals.
