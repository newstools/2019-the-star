Doctors at Kenyatta National Hospital have reconstructed the penis of a Form Three boy that had been chopped off in December last year. The procedure that took seven hours involved a team of 15 multidisciplinary specialists. The boy was assaulted by an unknown person last month who chopped off his reproductive organ at the base near the scrotum using a kitchen knife. The incident occurred at night. The patient, a firstborn in his family, was referred to KNH from a county hospital. Speaking to the press on Wednesday, the lead doctor said the chopped organ had been stored in a hospital where the boy was first rushed. The patient, whose identity was concealed by the medics, was reviewed by plastic and urology teams who then booked him for the procedure. The boy arrived at KNH looking weak and in trauma, having bled heavily. He was, however, in a stable state, the doctors said. Thanks to the success of the procedure, the doctors said the patient will now be able to urinate and engage in sexual gratification again. "The patient is reporting erection and the length is good," they said. Doctors said he is due for discharge in two weeks. The success of this operation adds to a list of surgical milestones the doctors at the national facility over the last five years. In February last year, the hospital announced that its team of doctors had successfully reattached the arm of a boy, 17, Joseph Theuri, which had been accidentally severed by a chaff cutter machine.
