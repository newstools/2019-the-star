Makueni woman representative Rose Museo has asked politicians eyeing various seats in 2022 to stop early campaigns and serve residents. Museo said elected leaders should stop politics and work for the people. She said Makueni residents have a lot of challenges including food insecurity, bad roads and poor education “Leaders should focus on addressing these issues before speaking about 2022 politics. As of now, residents don’t care who becomes MP, senator or governor in the next elections,” Museo said. She spoke just days after Deputy Governor Adelina Mwau declared her interest in succeeding Kivutha Kibwana whose term ends in 2022. Mwau, 66, said she is the best candidate to carry on with Kibwana’s development record. Others said to have an eye on the governor’s seat include Kibwezi West MP Patrick Musimba and Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr. Museo spoke when she issued scholarships to poor students who scored 350 marks and above in last year’s KCPE exam. The scholarships worth Sh1.8 million would cater for the students fees, personal effects and pocket money. The money was from the National Government Affirmative Action Fund. “It is a meagre allocation considering MPs are given Sh30 million. We need more funds to help our people,” Museo said. She asked for help from residents. “We have many students seeking financial assistance from our database. Let those who have been educated through the same manner come forward and assist,” she said.
