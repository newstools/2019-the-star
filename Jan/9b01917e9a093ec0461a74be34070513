Politician Steve Mbogo is under investigation for the possession of a firearm he was spotted with during the attack on Dusit Hotel on Tuesday. Sources at the Nairobi DCI headquarters say the politician was brought in for questioning earlier on Wednesday accompanied by his lawyer Edwin Sifuna. However, Sifuna says the officers "only came to ask him some questions" and maintained he's not under arrest. Mbogo was spotted holding a shotgun near the complex of the terrorist attack in the company of an unidentified man. He could not tell the detectives the whereabouts of his companion. Earlier on Wednesday, President Uhuru Kenyatta said the operation at 14 Riverside Drive ended at around 9.30 am. Uhuru confirmed 14 lives were lost during the attack.
