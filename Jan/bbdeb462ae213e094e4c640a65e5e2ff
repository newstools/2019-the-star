A legislator has told former Kitutu Masaba member of Parliament Timothy Bosire to focus on reviving his political career instead attacking Deputy President William Ruto. North Mugirango’s Joash Nyamoko Nyamoko said Bosire’s persistent attacks on Ruto were misplaced. Bosire is the ODM national treasurer and a close ally of party leader Raila Odinga. “We have heard that Bosire wants to become governor of Nyamira. He should be spending his time in wooing people to support his bid,” Nyamoko said on Thursday. He said Bosire can alternatively campaign for Raila if the former Prime Minister decides to run for president again in 2022. Nyamoko, who spoke to the Star by phone, said Ruto will get more votes from Kisii and Nyamira counties than any other presidential candidate in 2022. The DP has made more than 20 trips to Kisii and Nyamira counties since the 2017 general elections. Nyamoko said the move was just a rehearsal for the next elections.

So far the reception has been excellent,” Nyamoko said. The MP who is the spokesman of Gusii lawmakers was responding to Bosire after the ODM official dismissed Ruto’s trips as an exercise in futility. “Ruto is ready to face any presidential candidate in 2022 and people should not run scared,” Nyamoko said. Nyamoko was elected on a Jubilee party ticket. Ruto has gained the support of most MPs and other elected leaders from Kisii and Nyamira counties as he seeks to firm up his presidential bid.
