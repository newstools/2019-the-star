The officer in charge of Katilu Irrigation Scheme in Turkana South has warned that mathenge bushes are overgrowng the scheme and will destroy it. Daniel Waweru called on Turkana farmers to spend most of their time in the farm and ensure the fields are cultivated to avoid encroachment of the invasive tree that grows very fast especially along the canals, destroying crop roots. The scheme is under the National Irrigation Board. “Mathenge is a big menace in Katilu Irrigation Scheme because of laziness of our farmers. We have advised farmers make sure their fields are under crop production every year,” Waweru told the Star in his office at Katilu. Otherwise, Waweru said, Mathenge tree will and destroy the scheme on 2,000 acres, currently cropped with maize, sorghum, green grams and horticultural crops. Waweru said alcoholism in Katilu has undermined farmers’ productivity. He urged farmers to cooperate and raise operation and maintenance fees for repair of canals and control gates. “ We call on the all stakeholders to come on board and advise the farmers to pay for operation and maintenance of the scheme,” he said.
