Doctors in Bungoma have issued a 21-day strike notice following the county government's failure to honour their CBA signed in 2018. The doctors working in both public and private sectors across the county's nine constituences gave the notice on Saturday during the first Bungoma doctors' assembly of 2019 under KMPDU Western branch in Kanduyi. KMPDU Western branch chairman Dr Antony Akoto said doctors' and other health workers' morale is low because of lack of promotions, hiring and a deteriorating work environment. Akoto said no meeting has been held on implementation of the CBA since it was signed more than a year ago. He said doctors were being victimised, making them live in a state of panic. "We wish to state that as doctors we strongly support universal health coverage and efforts towards actualising this dream to the benefit of the clients we serve," Akoto said. Bernad Wambulwa, the KMPDU branch treasurer, said the county government under Governor Wycliffe Wangamati must "wake up and do more to improve health care". "We urge our governor to stop neglecting doctors and health care workers and purpose to meet us and resolve these pending issues," he said. "We also wish to add our voice on the ongoing debate on doctors' fees for those in private practice by urging the government to focus on strengthening public health care facilities where over 90 per cent of Kenyans seek services." Wambulwa said the state should stop sideshows because the majority of Kenyans cannot afford to seek care in private facilities. He said the county only has one gynecologist.
