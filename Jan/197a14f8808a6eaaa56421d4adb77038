Two MPs clashed in a public meeting on Monday over political supremacy in Ukambani. Trouble started after Ktui Woman Representative Irene Kasalu accused governors Kivutha KIbwana (Makueni), Charity Ngilu (Kitui) and Alfred Mutua (Machakos) of disrespecting Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, whom she said was the undisputed king of Ukambani. But Kangundo legislator Fabian Muli dismissed her assertion, saying the narrative of ‘political kingpin’ was “old-fashioned and overtaken by events”. “Away with this nonsense about political kingpin. As a community, we need to start looking at things differently and objectively. We cannot afford to keep politicking about who the kingpin is and yet our people are waiting for us to serve them,” Muli said. The two were at the launch of National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF) programme by Machakos MP Joyce Kamene at Kangundo DEB Primary School. Kasalu reminded the three governors: “Since we are in Ukambani and you all know what is happening I cannot fail to talk about politics. There are three individuals who have recently gone crazy and are now going all over demeaning our leader, Kalonzo. They will need another 20 years to ascend to Kalonzo’s political status, and must therefore respect him.” She said the activities of the governors were aimed at spoiling for Kalonzo, who has declared his bid for the presidency in the next General Election. Muli said true leadership puts first the interests of the ordinary citizens and not obsession with political power. Heated politics have dominated Ukambani for the past few weeks following the open rebellion by the governors. The trio has announced a new grouping - Peoples Empowerment Movement – which they say is geared towards rolling back poverty through the creation opportunities for the residents. The governors claim Kalonzo has done little for Ukambani in all his years in political leadership. This has been dismissed by the Wiper leader’s supporters as untrue.
