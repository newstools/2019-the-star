Governor Jackson Mandago of Uasin Gishu has dismissed as “untrue and malicious” an Auditor General’s report that questions the use of Sh500 million. Edward Ouko’s 2016/2018 audit report queried among other projects the use of Sh7.8 million for the construction of four toilets in Turbo sub county and Sh32 million for the construction of two bridges. Some Sh5 million, the report said, was misused on domestic travel by the executive in the county. Further, the auditor general said in the report that the payments made by the executive were irregular and questionable. Some of the transactions were done during the August 2017 general election. “Those are misleading claims by the office of the auditor general and we ask them to do their work carefully instead of playing politics,” Mandago said. The governor said his records were clean and the auditor general should not taint his name with four years left before the end of his second term. The projects listed include hospitals, roads and water. The county boss said he was not bothered by the report by the auditor general on his administration and he would strive to complete all projects he has initiated. “I will not miss my sleep simply because the auditor general has made such claims because am sure my records are clean,” he said. He was speaking at his office in Eldoret yesterday. Mandago said residents of Eldoret can attest to the work done by his administration. The governor explained that all the money received from the Treasury can be accounted for. “I am ready to defend all the projects that have been funded from the devolved resources. We have no projects that were done without public involvement,” Mandago said. “There has always been value for money on all projects undertaken by the county and auditors should do their work properly,” the governor said.
