The Bungoma government is building a Sh2 million maternity wing at Lurare dispensary in Maraka ward, Webuye East. The county has partnered with the Health ministry. Health executive Anthony Walela yesterday said mothers will no longer travel long distances to get maternity services. Most mothers currently travel to Webuye Subcounty Hospital. The county official praised the management of the facility. Bungoma will ensure the contractor gets cash on time, he said. The contractor assured that the work will be completed by month-end. Present was health chief officer Patrick Wandili. He warned the contractor against doing a shoddy job. Payments will not be authorised until residents and the Public Works Department approve the project, Wandili said. MCA Ali Majani Mutoka urged the contractor to employ youths from the area. He cautioned, that only those who qualify and are disciplined be hired. Meanwhile, the county will deploy 20 lab technicians to its health facilities.
