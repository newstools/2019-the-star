Yesterday the new EACC chief executive Mbarak Twalib was sworn in amid a blame game over the failure to successfully prosecute corrupt officials and politicians. Chief Justice David Maraga blamed poor work by investigators. Attorney General Paul Kihara agreed that investigation was often poor but said that the courts were slow. Twalib promised to review outstanding cases and remove any bottlenecks. The fight against corruption failed in recent years because institutions were compromised. In 2018 the fight against corruption turned a new page with the appointment of DPP Noordin Haji, DCI George Kinoti and AG Kihara. Hopefully Twalib will provide the final missing link. In the past inter-agency rivalry undermined the corruption fight - now we need cooperation. And the courts must be faster. Maraga said yesterday that he had brought 10 magistrates to Nairobi to work solely on corruption. Let them hear cases without adjournments. We don't want delays like the extradition case against Samuel Gichuru and Chris Okemo that is still bogged down in the courts despite a watertight investigation by the Jersey government.
