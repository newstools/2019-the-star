It's the most exciting thing that's happened so far in 2019 and everyone's talking about the SportPesa Cup for a good reason. 8 teams, 4 from Kenya and 4 from Tanzania have been brought together for a fine display of football and love of the game from the fans. The 2019 SportPesa (SP) Cup has taken the East African region and beyond by storm with the third edition of the tournament already surpassing the 2017 and 18 competitions ahead of today's final. Eight teams lined-up with the aim of winning the coveted trophy, USD30,000 and the chance to host English Premier League side at the start of it all on January 22. At the end of six riveting matches, Kenyan sides Kariobangi Sharks FC and Bandari FC will duke it out for the crown as the last teams standing. The eight team invitational tournament has played a key role in boosting tourism between Kenya and Tanzania. It has become a highlight of the soccer season in Kenya and Tanzania and a showcase of talent. SportPesa has engaged in a decisive way on building football and is giving opportunities to young people to be exposed at international level. The tournament is an actual testimony that sports should be used as an opportunity to bring people together. When Kenyan and Tanzanians engage each other in sporting activities and the public coming to support in a friendly way, that is how you start growing our relations and better our integration. SportPesa should now consider involving teams from Uganda and the rest of Africa and beyond in future.
