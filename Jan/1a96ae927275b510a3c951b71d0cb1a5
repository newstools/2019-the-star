Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati has disowned Ford Kenya members who visited DP William Ruto’s Sugoi home on Wednesday. He criticised the group who were part of 800 delegates from Bungoma and Busia counties who pledged support for Ruto's 2022 bid. Wangamati said the group went in their individual capacity. “Speaking as a Ford Kenya elected governor, I categorically say we as a party have not entered any agreement with any presidential candidate for the 2022 presidential bid,” he said. Wangamati spoke on Thursday, after inspecting roadworks in Maraka ward, Webuye East constituency. “As at now, we as Ford Kenya are forging alliances with ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi and Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa in preparation to take over the presidency in 2022,” he said. Wangamati expressed disappointment with the leaders for praising "neighbours instead of their own brothers and sisters", especially their party boss Senator Moses Wetang’ula. Among the Ford Kenya elected leaders who visited the DP’s home included Bungoma Woman Representative Catherine Wambilianga, Kabuchai MP James Lusweti and some MCAs. Jubilee leaders present included Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, MPs Didmus Barasa (Kimilili), John Waluke (Sirisia), Dan Wanyama (Webuye West) and Mwambu Mabonga (Bumula).
