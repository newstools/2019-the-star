Police in Kitale are looking for a gang that shot dead a man and his daughter in Karakatet village along the Kenya-Uganda border. Endebess OCPD Shadrack Ruto said the two were gunned down early Sunday morning. The attackers disappeared without stealing anything. "The killers struck at 4 am and forced their way in after breaking the door and shot the victims before escaping without stealing anything, we are not able to tell how many they are," Ruto said in an interview. The man's wife was not in the house as she had gone to the hospital after developing labour pains. The OCPD said the man's neighbour heard gunshots and moments later a vehicle was spotted leaving from the compound. "We are investigating the motive of the killing and people behind the attack. We urge members of the public to help us with vital information to enable us to nab the culprits involved in the incident," he added. The OCPD denied claims that the killing was linked to land tussle in the area. "The incident has no connection with a land problem but we will ensure no stone remains unturned," he said.
