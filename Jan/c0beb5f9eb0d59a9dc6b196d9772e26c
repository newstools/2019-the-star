Siaya Senator James Orengo has supported calls for the retirement of Deputy President William Ruto ahead of 2022 succession elections. Orengo (below) said that Ruto was automatically bound to cease from seeking the presidency in 2022 given that he has already served his two terms in office. The Senator asked Ruto to eat  humble pie and retire with President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022. “I ask Ruto not to be deceived by selfish political interest but rather retire with Uhuru in 2022,”  Orengo said. He was speaking on Saturday during the burial of politician Okello Gonda in Ugunja constituency. His statement comes a few days after Jubilee party vice chairman David Murage resigned from the position after he scathingly told off Ruto on succession politics of 2022.
