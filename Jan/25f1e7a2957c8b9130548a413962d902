Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i on Monday said he wants more women in the security sector. The CS commended female officers who have been outstanding in their duties. "We want more female county commissioners and deputy county commissioners. We are hungry for more women," Matiang'i said. He spoke in Mombasa where he met regional coordinators, regional commanders, county commissioners and county commanders from across the country. In a recent reshuffle, Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet named seven women county police commanders. They are Naomi Nzilani who was deployed to Bomet, Leah Kithei (Kirinyaga), Catherine Mugwe (Nyamira), Beatrice Gachago (Kajiado), Lydia Adamba (Kitui) and Esther Seroney (Homa Bay). He said strong female officers should be given opportunities to lead in the security sector. "The security sector should not be male-dominated," the CS said.
