Celebrated actor and scriptwriter Abel Mutua has said his biological father ditched his mother for siring his younger brother. "He left us when I was only five years old," Abel told Radio Jambo's Massawe Japanni on Tuesday. "He went and married another woman, who had one kid, and did not sire any other kid with her." Since then, Abel said, he has met his father only once in his lifetime. "I met him in 2013, and I am the one who told him our mum died. I felt for sure he was never in my life," he said. Abel said when his father left them, his mother remarried again when he was 14. "I was raised by a step-father who came in with his five children and my mother had two, and later my mother gave birth to one child. He was and is still a great person in our lives," he said. Abel said he never dated in college until the last semester of his final year, and the girl he dated became his wife soon after he impregnated her while she was still in college. "The birth of our daughter traumatised us so much because we were not doing well then, and that is why we have not had a second child yet," he said. Abel Mutua is the man behind the hit local shows ‘The Real Househelps of Kawangware’ and ‘Sue na Jonnie’.
