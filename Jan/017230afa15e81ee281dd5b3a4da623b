Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has put county officials involved in grabbing of land in South C on notice. He said officials found guilty of aiding a private developer illegally acquire construction approvals will face disciplinary action. On Saturday evening, two people were arrested - Joshua Irungu, the son of the private developer, and Naftali Muchangi, the caretaker of the land which has been repossessed by the Nairobi government. The two will be arraigned on Monday. “We had already confirmed that the private developer had grabbed the land and also encroached on a road reserve during the first demolition exercise that I officiated over a few months ago. I’m now shocked that the same person has gone ahead and acquired approvals from City Hall to reconstruct the perimeter wall,” Sonko said. Last year in July, Sonko led the demolition of the same perimeter wall after issuing a 14-day notice to private developers who had encroached on public land and road reserves. Acting county secretary Pauline Waititu and Roads CEC Mohamed Dagane presided over the demolition of the perimeter wall on Saturday. Dagane said Phase Two of the rehabilitation of an access road in South C had stalled after the private developer encroached on a road reserve. Waititu said the county will not tolerate impunity and corruption. “The repossessed land is a public utility land and it must be reclaimed for the people of South C as ordered by the governor,” she said. South C Ward rep Osman Khalif and Residents' Association chairperson Ranjana Bharaj thanked Sonko for the demolition. “We appreciate the move by Sonko’s administration to demolish the perimeter wall which had encroached on public land. The private developer had also taken over a public land which was meant to be a playground in the area,” Bharaj said.
