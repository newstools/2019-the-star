The family of a 22-year-old hotel worker has appealed to the police to promptly investigate his death. Evans Ngugi drowned on Monday in a Tigoni hotel pool where he was working. His body was retrieved yesterday. He was from Kabuku in Limuru subcounty. Family and friends spent the night at the dam waiting for Kiambu county divers to pull out the body. Peter Kimani told journalists that his nephew’s body was retrieved from the deep side on the pool. “We came here yesterday evening after learning that Ngugi had drowned. However, we are not satisfied with the management’s story of what happened,” he said.
