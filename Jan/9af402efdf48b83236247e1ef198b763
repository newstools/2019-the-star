The National Police Service will no longer buy or issue new swagger sticks to senior officers, a dress regulation circular states. Deputy Inspector General Edward Mbugua said the decision was madeby the National Police Service Board. “From this date there will be no personal issue of swagger canes but they will be restricted to commands and it will be subjected to handing over,” the notice reads. It is dated January 11 this year. The officers in command listed are regional and formation commanders, directors and coordinators, county and subcounty commanders and station commanders. Others are section heads of training institutions. It is unclear why the directive was issued, but it is believed this is to ensuring all corruption loopholes within the police service are sealed. In a recent study by the Office of the Inspector General, it was found there had been massive wastage of resources in procurement of police items. IG Joseph Boinnet has approved the change of name of police dog unit and its training school. The unit will be renamed the Kenya Police K-9 unit. The training school will be called National Police Service K-9 Academy.
