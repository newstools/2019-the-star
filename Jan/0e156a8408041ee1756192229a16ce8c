Interior CS Fred Matiang’i yesterday announced new measures to improve security. Apart from a reshuffle of the top regional and county security personnel, the CS wants security structures at the grassroots to be harmonised in the next one month.These structures include peace committees, village elders, the Nyumba Kumi Initiative ambassadors and community policing teams. “This way, assistant chiefs will know who they are working with,” Matiang’i said. He spoke at PrideInn Beach Hotel in Mombasa. “Sometimes, due to lack of coordination, we lose information we should have because we have not coordinated these people,” the CS said. He asked the police to stop ‘public relations engagements’ when it comes to security of Kenyans. There will be several operations across the country to mop up illegal firearms, he said. The CS acknowledged that certain neighbourhoods have insecurity problems. These include Majengo, Kisauni and Likoni in Mombasa, Eastleigh, Mathare, Dandora and Kayole in Nairobi. “2019 is the year to clean them.” He said the operations to clean these areas will not be a public relations drive.
