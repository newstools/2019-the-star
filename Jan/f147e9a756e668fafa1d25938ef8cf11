Mama Ngina Drive in Mombasa will be given a facelift to attain international standards. Tourism CS Najib Balala said in a statement on Sunday that coastal beach destinations have been the main drivers of Kenya’s tourism sector. However, in the recent past, the sector has experienced challenges including high competition and low demand. "This has resulted in the decline in Kenya’s competitiveness and low demand for its key tourism products among its competitors, particularly the coastal beach product due to limited leisure and recreational facilities and amenities," Balala said. To address this, the CS said the Ministry of Tourism initiated the Mombasa Waterfront Project, previously known as Mama Ngina Drive, as a key flagship project to boost the industry. Balala said the project is expected to transform and rejuvenate Mombasa into a leading and competitive world-class tourism destination. Emphasis will be placed on Swahili and Coastal culture and heritage structures, he said.  The Treasury has allocated Sh460 million in the 2018/2019 financial year as a one-off budget item under tourism recovery to complete the project. On Monday, President Uhuru Kenyatta will launch the facelift that is expected to be completed in five months. The area, which is a favourite to many tourists, is broadly covered by Mama Ngina and Jomo Kenyatta public beaches. "It will also improve visitor experience at Mama Ngina Drive and the adjacent ferry and commuter transport terminal as well as enhance the structure of the waterfronts," he said. Traditionally crafted Swahili decorative elements such as vidaka and decorative plaster surrounds will also form the hallmarks of the new look. The facelift entails the development of a public square, two Iconic gateways, a Swahili Cultural Centre, pigeon coops, paved pathway, restaurants and visitors' parking area. Other amenities are modern selling points, an amphitheatre and landscaped gardens. Click here for the latest political news
