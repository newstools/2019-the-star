The Mandera county government has promised to restore the Mandera market that was razed on Monday night. “I am calling on the traders to remain patient as we plan on re-constructing the market,” governor Ali Roba told the Star yesterday. At least 500 traders lost properties running into millions of shillings to fire that razed the largest market in Mandera town. Efforts by the traders to save their wares were unsuccessful as the blaze  spread fast due to strong winds. Roba said his administration will invest in more fire fighting machines. The various traders deal in merchandise ranging from clothes, vegetables, fruits, spices and miraa. Fire fighters who  arrived 30 minutes later were overwhelmed. “This is just too much for me to bear. I can’t believe that my shed which I have used over the years to sell miraa is no more,” regretted  one of the traders only identified as Mariam. This is the fourth time in five years that fire has destroyed this market. Yesterday the traders called on the county government to help them to restore the market. “We are appealing to the county to provide us with some funds to kick-start our businesses,” said Mohamed Abdi, a clothes trader. The cause of the blaze that started at around 9pm is yet to be determined. The security team led by the Mandera county commissioner Kutswa Olaka  promised to investigate the cause. Yesterday, miraa traders were  conducting their business in the scorching sun. Some traders blamed the fire on the county government. They said the fire was started to push them out of the market after they resisted earlier eviction attempts.
