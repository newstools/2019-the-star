Loulou Hassan and Kanze Dena are still good friends, even after Kanze was appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta as deputy State House spokesperson. "Kanze is more of a sister to me, so the gap is filled," Loulou told Word Is on Monday. "She is that sister I have never had because even after giving birth, she would come on a daily basis and take care of my baby." The Kiswahili news anchor moved netizens when she penned an emotional letter to Kanze Dena after she left the media. "Kanze told me a long time before that she would be leaving and I thought it was a joke. I think she was advised to tell me so I could get used as early as possible," LoulouÂ said. The anchor is now working with her husband Rashid Abdalla on 'Nipashe Wikendi'. "It is fine working with my husband because he is my friend and so we cope. We hardly argue and when we do, we don't take it that serious, just little misunderstandings," she said. "We were friends before we married each other and that is why we know how to work together." The couple partnered way back in a local radio station at the Coast, and Loulou says they are now used to that. "We have not had a major challenge but what we are fearing is that now because we have a baby, there may be a time our baby will not be feeling well, God forbid, and we have to choose who will be responsible for the baby and who will be working," she said. Although Loulou enjoys being back to work, it has not been as easy because she has a newborn she has to take care of. Loulou and Rashid made history by becoming the first married couple to anchor for the same television station.
