A teacher in Baringo North subcounty is admitted to hospital after he was assaulted by a rape suspect. Zachayo Rutto,46, was hit on the head by a 22-year old man, whom he says was attempting to rape a schoolgirl on December 31. “We were on our way home around 1am after celebrating the New Year in the church.  I heard children screaming for help that their friend was being attacked,” the Kipcherere Primary School teacher said. He said it was dark, and when he approached the scene the suspect was already on top of the girl  and attempting to undress her. “I put on my spotlight to identify him and when I saw him collecting a stone on the ground, I hurriedly switched off the light but the stone landed on my head. I then fell down,” he said. He thanked God to be alive, adding that, he felt some blood oozing from inside his left ear. Residents hurriedly rushed him to Baringo County Referral Hospital where he is also being treated for a dislocation of his right leg. The suspect, a part-time boda boda operator, is said to have assaulted more than 15 village rs over different disputes.  He remains  a free man despite being reported to the police. “We are requesting the police to help arrest him,” said Sammy Rutto, Zachayo’s brother, noting  that the suspect is among idle school dropouts engaged in alcoholism and trafficking in illicit brews and drugs.
