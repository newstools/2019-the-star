Kitui County Assembly has welcomed a call by governor Charity Ngilu to have the county government dissolved. The disbandment of the Kitui government, according to Majority leader Peter Kilonzo, would be “a good riddance to Ngilu’s leadership”. “Fresh elections could be an opportunity to get a new governor whose sole agenda would ensure the lives of Kitui residents improve tremendously,” Kilonzo said yesterday in a press statement. He was responding to last Sunday’s call by Ngilu for the dissolution of the county government. The governor, at the enthronement of AIC Bishop for Mwingi area Nicodemus Kituo, said MCAs were obsessed with blackmailing and undermining her government. She said MCAs were working against her administration because “she has failed to take them for lavish and luxurious retreats to Mombasa at the expense of tax payers”. They had financially paralyzed her administration since their last December rejection of a supplementary budget, she said. The governor accused county Assembly Speaker George Ndotto, also her long time political nemesis, of spearheading the MCAs’ onslaught against her administration, saying Ndotto had previously attempted to unseat her as the Kitui Central MP. Kilonzo in his statement said threats of dissolution would not deter the Assembly’s war against corruption in Ngilu’s administration. He exonerated Ndotto from blame saying he only moderates debates. “We wish to tell the governor that she is late in calling for dissolution. Demand for accountability will not stop till she learns how to do things right. The MCAs are more than willing to seek fresh mandate from Musangi (adopted term for residents),” the statement further read. Kilonzo asked Ngilu to be awake to the reality that the MCAs were there to oversee her work and if she did thing wrong, they would question her. He said the Assembly rejected Ngilu’s supplementary budget because it was faulty and could be challenged in court if passed.
