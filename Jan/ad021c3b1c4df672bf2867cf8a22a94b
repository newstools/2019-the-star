Despite surrendering their unbeaten run in the SportPesa Premier League to Kakamega Homeboyz in a 4-0 loss yesterday at Bukhungu Stadium, Bandari remained second on the log with 18 points. Bandari were riding on a form of their own until yesterday when they succumbed to Homeboyz, who began life without their head coach - Paul Nkata - on a winning note besides scaling to tenth with 12 points. Veteran forward Allan Wanga was the big story of the day as he had a debut to remember on the dugout as he began his tenure as a stand-in coach on a winning note and helped himself twice to the scoring sheet. Wanga was handed the stand-in coach role after Ugandan Nkata was fired over allegations of match-fixing and the former AFC Leopards forward made good use of his experience to drown Bandari. Bandariâ€™s tactician Bernard Mwalala attributed heavy defeat on fatigue due to congested matches that has left his players with little time to recover. Bandari are fresh from the SportPesa Super Cup in Dar-es-salaam, Tanzania, where they lost 1-0 to Kariobangi Sharks. On his part, Kakamega Homeboyz acting coach Allan Wanga formerly with AFC Leopards and Tusker FC revealed that they had good preparations for the match and played according to the instructions.
