Nakuru governor Lee Kinyanjui has criticised those opposed to rehabilitation of Naivasha Subcounty Hospital, saying the project will continue. Kinyanjui said ongoing politics were meant to stall the project that would benefit thousands of people. Last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta directed Kengen to set aside Sh300 million to upgrade the hopsital to Level 5 status. “We came up with a committee to map design and give us a feedback on how to carry out the project. I don’t know why people are reading malice in this,” the governor said. The hospital board will have a say on where the hospital will be built, he said.
