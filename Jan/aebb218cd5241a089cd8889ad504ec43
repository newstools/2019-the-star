The search for the bodies of two brothers who drowned in River Tana last Friday, turned tragic on Sunday after a volunteer diver also drowned. Korio Kusow had volunteered to search for the bodies in the crocodile-infested river in Galbet, Garissa, but he disappeared into the raging waters moments later. The brothers’ bodies were retrieved yesterday and buried in accordance with the Islamic rites. The search for the rider continues amid fears that his body had been washed downstream. Area chief Salat Mohammed said one of the two brothers was to join Form 1 at a Wajir school. The other brother had sat the KCSE exam last year. “They went on a swimming expedition in the river at 5.30pm on Friday. They never returned,” the chief said. Twentieth incident Salat said this was the twentieth incident on the same spot in two years. He urged parents to monitor the movement of their children. “We have unsuccessfully sealed off the entry points to the river where children sneak and swim. They find new routes to go swimming,” he added. Kenya Red Cross regional manager Mohammed Abdikadir said getting professional divers was a major challenge. The few available were unskilled, he said and told those willing to assist but lacked skills to keep off. “The diver, who was a local boda boda operator, had no knowledge of the operation and that is why he drowned,” Abdikadir said. Professional divers needed Area MCA Abdirizak Ismail said there was a need to acquire speedboats and professional divers to help in drowning incidents and other water-related accidents. “It’s a pity that four days after the drowning took place, we have not gotten professional divers to do the job,” he said. The parents of the two brothers were traumatised and did not talk to the press.
