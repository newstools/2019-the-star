The government has developed ICT standards to guide the use of public resources. The ICT Authority and ICT professionals from public institutions are in Naivasha for a three-day workshop to discuss the guidelines. ICTA partnerships and innovation director Eunice Kariuki yesterday said they seek to fix the rampant wastage of resources in government institutions. The guidelines will make it easy to track financial transactions, she said at Lake Naivasha Panorama Park. Kariuki said Kenyans will get value for their taxes once they roll out the initiative. “The standards will give bit-by-bit information on daily occurrences of government institutions and relay the same to concerned authorities in real time,” she said. The director said some ICT officers may mean well in their daily activities, but it becomes difficult to track the cash sent by the Treasury. The authority will register Internet service providers to improve their services. Only those who meet the requirements will do business with the government, Kariuki said. “The issue of fake ISPs (internet service providers) in the country is endemic. We’ve come in as stakeholders in the sector to regulate them and publish their information for the general public as required in law,” she said. “Our goal is to leverage IT governance to provide value for IT investment in government and improve services by aligning IT with business strategies and government priorities — the Big Four agenda.” Kariuki urged the participants to promptly apply the standards at their workplaces. “By applying the standards, there will be much more transparency and accountability to the taxpayer, with clear processes to break indicators down in a way citizens understand,” she said.
