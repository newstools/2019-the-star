Plans to rehabilitate and develop all water fronts in Mombasa to help beautify the county and attract more tourists are in top gear. There will be a ground breaking ceremony of the Mama Ngina Drive Regeneration project today. President Uhuru Kenyatta, ODM leader Raila Odinga and Mombasa governor Hassan Joho will grace the occasion as fruits of the handshake continue to be witnessed across the country. The Mama Ngina Drive, one of the tourist attraction sites in the county, will undergo a Sh460 million regeneration to turn it into a world class water park. Mombasa Tourism chief officer Innocent Mugabe told the Star yesterday that the project will have a presidential square, from where all functions will be conducted. “We will also have an outdoor amphitheatre, gardens with beautiful landscape, a cultural centre, and we will improve the walkways and drive ways,”Mugabe said on the phone. The Mama Ngina Drive is the first of many water front projects that have been approved. The other is the Jomo Kenyatta Public Beach, commonly known as Pirates Beach. This will cost at least Sh190 million and the ground breaking ceremony is set for later this month. “We are pushing to have a budget for all the water fronts in Mombasa, including the Mombasa Beach, Nyali Beach and Shelly Beach in Likoni, developed into world class standards,” Mugabe said.
