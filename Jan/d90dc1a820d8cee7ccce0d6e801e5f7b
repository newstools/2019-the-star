The minority Boni community in Lamu’s terror-prone Basuba ward has given the national government a seven-day ultimatum to re-open all schools shut for over five years due to insecurity. Community elders have vowed to hold demos and pull every Boni child out of school. They said they will not allow their children into the safe learning centres established by the county government kilometers away in Lamu west. Speaking in Lamu yesterday, Boni elders led by Basuba ward MCA Barissa Deko (below) expressed their disappointment over the government’s continued silence over the situation. Basuba, Milimani, Mararani, Mangai and Kiangwe primary schools have not opened since 2014 when they were closed following a spate of terror attacks by suspected Al shabaab militants. Teachers fled and have never returned. Residents say they will not have their children shuttled halfway across Lamu in search of education.
