President Uhuru Kenyatta has affirmed that persons implicated in corruption will not receive state appointments until their names are cleared. Speaking in Bomas on Friday during the Anti-corruption Conference, Uhuru said he will ensure that lifestyle audits of state officers, from procurement officers to himself, are fast-tracked. Uhuru said those in office who have been accused of corruption will step aside when accused. Earlier, Uhuru urged anti-graft agencies in the country to collaborate more for the fight against corruption to be won. The president said that the multi-agency approach in the war against corruption is showing results and should be embraced more going forward.

The Head of State was speaking at the DCI Headquarters on Kiambu Road when he awarded state honours to several officers from the DCI and the ODPP for their outstanding contribution in the security sector especially in the fight against corruption. Uhuru called for more synergy between agencies in the security and justice sector. "We are not here to merge the DCI and the ODPP but we are here to recognise that these two institutions need each other for effective service delivery," he said. "We recognise the independence and also the interdependence of these offices. Our success cannot be independent of each other. We will not succeed if we do not collaborate."
