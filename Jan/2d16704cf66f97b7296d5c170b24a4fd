Parts of North and West Pokot subcounty have been hit by an acute water shortage caused by a prolonged dry spell. Residents have to walk up to 30km in search of water, while others have resorted to digging through sand to get underground water. The shortage has also disrupted learning in schools. Deputy Governor Nicholas Atudonyang on Saturday urged the national government to intervene. “MPs need to educate residents on water harvesting, sinking of boreholes, dams and pans. The county and national governments need to work together to make sure residents access clean water,” he said. Pauline Chepsera from Suam village said the dry spell has reached extremes. “We need boreholes in our homesteads. Our children are suffering in schools. We are forced to carry a 20-litre jerrycan of water over a long distance. We have to rest four times before reaching water points,” she said. “We want the government to move with speed and help us sustain our livehood." Ombolion chief Joseph Korkimul said many cattle could die if the situation persists. “Animals have started dying and we fear those that have migrated to Uganda will be infected by diseases,” he said.
