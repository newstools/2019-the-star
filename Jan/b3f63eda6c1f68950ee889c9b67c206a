Ford Kenya Party leader Moses Wetangula on Wednesday called on ODM leader Raila Odinga to endorse Wiper’s Julias Mawathe in the Embakasi South by-election. The Bungoma Senator said that Wiper, Ford Kenya and ANC have always supported ODM candidates in such situations and it was time the Orange party to reciprocate. "In the spirit of the Nasa brotherhood, it’s not good to create bad blood. Our move is positive towards uniting Kenyans, our brothers in Jubilee have shown the way and we expect that from our brothers in ODM,” Wetangula said.

We did it during last term's by-election under Cord coalition and it can still happen,” he said. “In 2013 we all headed to Siaya to support Rasanga, same to the by-election relating to Moses Kajwang and Khatib Mashetani.” Wetangula said his party will not field a candidate in the repeat polls set for April 4 in support of Mawathe. He said the decision was reached by the party's top organ in the spirit of the handshake and coalition 'brotherhood'. The senator called on Ford Kenya supporters in Embakasi South to heed to the party's position. Wetangula disclosed that the precedence in the coalition arrangement both in Cord and Nasa dictates automatic support for the candidate who is petitioned against. The statement comes a day after Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka said the seat belongs to Wiper and called on ODM to support Mawathe. “ODM had a candidate who went to court but in the interest of what is happening in the country, it would be great if we all rally behind Wiper,” Kalonzo said.
