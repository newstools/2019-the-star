Fast-rising Tennis sensation Albert Njogu humbled an experienced Ibrahim Kibet 7-6(3), 7-6(3) to defend the Stars’ tournament staged at Nairobi Club. Njogu beat the same opponent in the first edition held last year and yesterday, the 17-year-old proved his lethargy, downing Kibet in a hotly contested final to pocket Sh50 000. The tournament was introduced last year by Tennis Kenya president James Kenani in a bid to boost the confidence of the junior players by playing them against the senior and experienced ones. Njogu surprisingly stunned Kibet in November last year to lift the inaugural title and the junior player further slapped Kibet with another loss, bundling him out of the Karen Open championships in the quarter finals stage with sets of 6-2,6-2. Prior to the finals, the two players had to sweat for the qualifications in the semis, where Kibet saw off Petty Andanda in similar sets of 6-3 while Njogu survived a second set scare to beat Sammy Muraya 6-2,6-4. In the girls’ category, Claire Muthoni beat Nancy Nduku 6-4,6-4 to win the title. The first edition was won by Nairobi-based Madagascan Narindra Ranaivo. Meanwhile, Kenya will look up to the reigning U-14 Africa Junior champion Angela Okutoyi and fast-rising Derrick Ominde when the East Africa Junior championships get underway today at Gymkhana Club in Dar, Tanzania. The annual tournament serves as the qualifier for the continental show and Kenya will have teams in both the under 14 and 16 with each team comprising of three players. Okutoyi, who graduated to the U-16, will be seeking the regional honours alongside her sibling Roselida Asumwa and Alicia Owegi. In the under 14, Kenya will be represented by the trio of Cynthia Cheruto, Raja Radha and Faith Urasa. In the boys U-16 age category, Ominde will lead the duo of Shah Kael and Brandon Sagala while in the U-14 Raymond Riziki, Edmond Nyabwari and Liberty Baraka will represent the country.
