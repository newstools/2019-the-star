Andy Murray has promised to ‘do everything’ to try and make sure his five-set epic against Roberto Bautista Agut is not his last ever appearance at the Australian Open. The former world No 1 revealed in an emotional press conference on Thursday that he will retire at Wimbledon this year. But having produced a stunning fightback in what ultimately ended in defeat to the high-flying Spaniard, Murray suggested he may yet make another appearance in Melbourne in 12 months time. “Amazing... I am going to be alright,” he began his post-match interview. “Thank you so much everyone who came out tonight. I’ve loved playing here over the years, amazing place to play tennis and if this is my last match, it is an amazing way to end.” “I gave everything I had, it wasn’t enough tonight. Congratulations to Roberto and his team. I don’t really have anything else to say, thanks to everyone, my family and friends and all those who have contributed to my career. Who knows, maybe I will see you again. I will do everything to be here again but if I do I will need another big operation again and there is no guarantee I will be able to come back.” It remains unclear if defeat to Bautista Agut is Murray’s last ever outing in professional tennis as he now goes away to contemplate an operation on his injured hip. The issue, which has troubled him badly in the last two years, took its toll in the final set and while the diagnosis has not been positive, the Scot is not ruling out a return in the future. Having dropped the first two sets it seemed Murray’s time left in Grand Slam competition was fading but with the help of the crowd, he rallied. “Today was an incredible night and Andy deserves this atmosphere,” Bautista Agut said afterwards. “He deserves all the people that came to watch him. It was a really good fight, he’s a tough fighter and gave everything until the last point.”
