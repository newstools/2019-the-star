March 9 should be declared a public holiday to commemorate the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, the Elders Association of Kenya have said. Speaking in Nairobi on Friday, the association's patron Martin Kenyanjui said the handshake should go down in history as the day Kenyans were joined together. "We strongly support the handshake. That day is when all of us should invade streets with festivities celebrating this famous and historic moment," he stated. Kenyanjui has asked politicians to stop premature campaigns ahead of the 2022 General Elections and instead wait for their turn. "Politics is not our daily bread and we are asking those with ambitions to wait. Our Constitution is very explicit that every five years we have elections. Be patient, wait and give our president time to accomplish his four agendas which we should all support and be part of it," he said. He asked the forces fighting the handshake to declare their agenda and praised Uhuru and Raila for ending tension and uncertainty in the country. Kenyajui who was accompanied by former MP Mohammed Galgalo, also condemned utterrances made by some Jubilee politicians who he described as messengers of doom and hatred. "We regret the utterances made by some of our leaders. Kenya is not governed on a tribal basis. Ethnicity has no room in the new Kenya." he said.
