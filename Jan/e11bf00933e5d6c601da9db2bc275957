The Director of Criminal Investigations is seeking information following DusitD2 attack as it works to establish the motive, preparation and associates of the five slain terrorists. "We are appealing to anyone with any kind of information that may help in the investigations to report in confidence," DCI said in a tweet on Thursday. The information should be reported at the DCI headquarters or at any police station. People can also call the National Police Service emergency hotlines - 999, 112 and 911. The hunt for more suspects who collaborated with the five terrorists is ongoing. Police said they have increased security at the main border points to deter collaborators from fleeing the country. Detectives handling the issue say they believe more collaborators are still out there and they are pursuing crucial leads into their whereabouts. After 19 hours of terror, gunfire, bloodshed and confusion, the siege at the DusitD2 hotel complex ended as it emerged that two of the attackers are from Kiambu and Nyeri. Police found documents in their pockets that seemed to reveal their identities and were confirming details. Read: Two Dusit killers were from Kiambu, Nyeri Click here for the latest political news
