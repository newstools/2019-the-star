Over 3,000 residents of Mkokoni and Kizingitini areas in Lamu East risk having their houses swept away by the Indian Ocean waters after their sea walls collapsed and caved in. As a result, the waters have found made their way to residential areas and business premises. The walls were specifically built to stop the flow of water from the Indian Ocean spilling into public areas. Residents blamed the collapse on lack of maintenance. They accused the Lamu county government of the poor structural manner in which the walls were constructed resulting in their collapse. They want the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to probe allegations of misappropriation of funds during construction of sea walls in the region by the previous county government regime. “The fact that we are now living without sea walls is just a disaster waiting to happen. It is surprising that the Mkokoni wall which was built just two years ago, has already collapsed, that obviously means someone did a shoddy job that puts us at risk,” Khaldun Vae, an elder from Lamu East said. The structural engineer in the state department of public works Hillary Nyaanga said plans are on to renovate the sea walls soon after they received reports on their bad state. However, Nyaanga did not disclose when exactly the works will start nor the budget allocation for the project. The residents also want jetties put up in the area to ease water transport.
