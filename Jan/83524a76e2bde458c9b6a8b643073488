The performances of back-to-back Kenyan Premier League champions Gor Mahia since the last couple of months in the 2018 campaign have left a lot to be desired. Though they would commendably reach the group stages of the CAF continental cup for a second successive season, the feel good factor was quickly undone by their exit from the Sportpesa Super Cup at the first hurdle despite winning it twice before. Now, their attention shifts to the league and making up the six point gap at the top of the table when they take on KCB. The bankers have started to find their feet on their return to the top flight after a shaky start. All that can be traced to the appointment of coach Sammy Omollo, who has provided steady hands at the tiller. The goalless midweek draw away at high-flying Western Stima provided evidence that the bankers can hold their own even in adverse conditions but the clash against the champions will be their sternest test yet. League leaders Mathare United have the opportunity to firm their grip on top spot when they play hosts to cash-strapped Vihiga United. Mathare have started the campaign strongly as they have done since Francis Kimanzi took over three years ago. They are one of two teams yet to lose a match so far and there is no danger that record will fall against a Vihiga side that has lost all their away matches. Sofapaka confirmed that John Baraza will be their coach on a permanent basis after their plucky win against struggling Posta Rangers. The all-time KPL top scorer will be keen to reward his employers with another win, this time against Zoo Kericho. Rangersâ€™ poor start to the campaign is in danger of sinking to a new low as they face an uphill task to get anything out of their trip to Awendo to face Sony Sugar. Ulinzi Stars face a tricky home tie against Kakamega Homeboyz just four days after escaping with a draw against bottom of the table Mount Kenya United, who will be away at Nzoia Sugar.
