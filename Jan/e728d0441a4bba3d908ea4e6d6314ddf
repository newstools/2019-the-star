A police officer yesterday shot himself to death moments after shooting and seriously injuring his girlfriend in Naivasha. Witnesses said the AP officer who was attached to Kipkonyo chief’s camp in Moi Ndabi firing at the woman 19 times. Naivasha deputy county commissioner John Opondo said the woman was admitted to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital and was in critical condition. “After shooting the girlfriend, the officer went back to the camp and shot himself dead. An inquest file has been opened,” Opondo said. Witness Saul Kimani said the officer appeared drunk. He confronted the woman who operates an M-Pesa shop and an argument ensued. "He shot at the woman 19 times with three bullets hitting her on the hips," Kimani said. He said the officer returned to the camp where he shot himself on the head and died on the spot. Elsewhere, a flower farm worker was raped before being strangled to death by unknown attackers near the Naivasha prison. “The woman is well known to residents. She was attacked at around 5am on her way to work and murdered,” boda boda rider James Karani said. In another incident, two men who were riding on a motorcycle along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway were hit and killed by a motorist. The accident happened just a few metres from the spot where the woman's body was found. Karani said the two had visited the scene where the woman was murdered when they were hit. The car was heading to Nakuru. “The two were crossing the road and probably did not check if there was an oncoming vehicle. They died on the spot,” Karani said.
