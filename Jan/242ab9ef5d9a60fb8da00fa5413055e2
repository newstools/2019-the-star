Jambo tea maker, APT Commodities Limited becomes the first company to be listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange website under the Ibuka incubation and acceleration programme. The firm whose portfolio of brands includes Jambo Chai, Tangawizi, Hassan Tea and Equity Green Tea beat other 13 competitors to be hosted on the bourse’s website under the Ibuka programme launched in December last year. According to NSE chief executive Geoffrey Odundo, the firm will not trade but rather offered an opportunity to experience global visibility as it prepares to list officially. “This admission is a key milestone for both APT Commodities and the NSE. It follows a rigorous evaluation and vetting process,’’ he said. He added that the listing underscores APT Commodities’ potential for growth as companies on the programme are evaluated by a team of highly qualified expert consultants and financial advisers. Ibuka is aimed at growing visibility whilst enhancing brand recognition and business opportunities among hostee companies.
