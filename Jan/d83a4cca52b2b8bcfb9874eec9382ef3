Here are the stories making headlines in the Star this Friday morning. KDF soldier shocked his son joined al Shabaab The father of one of the DusitD2 terror attack Ali Salim Gichunge alias Farouk has told the police that he didn't know his son had joined Somali based terror group al Shabaab. Ali Gichuge, a KDF sergeant, has told the police investing that Dusit hotel complex attack that he lost touch with his son in 2015 and was surprised to learn that he was among the five people who launched an audacious attack on a luxury hotel complex along 14 Riverside on Tuesday. Nine people have been arrested following the attack that killed at least 21 people.  Red Cross said yesterday that all the 50 people who had been reported missing had been accounted for. _____________________________________________________ Tedious process of body identification in Chiromo mortuary A sombre mood continued to engulf Chiromo Mortuary for the second day yesterday as family members of the DusitD2 hotel attack victim sought to identify the bodies of their loved ones. The relatives were not just bogged down by the heavy weight of their loss but also the long wait they had to endure to identify the bodies of their loved ones. The long wait was occasioned by the postmortem procedures that pathologists led by chief government chemist Johansen Oduor had to undertake on the bodies. _____________________________________________________ Wanjigi wins against Matiang'i in firearm revocation case The High Court yesterday quashed the decision by the Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i to revoke businessman Jimmi Wanjigi’s firearm certificate. Justice John Mativo ruled that the decision in the letter dated January 30 that revoked Wanjigi's licence was illegal. He said that Wanjigi had demonstrated sufficient grounds to warrant the court to grant him judicial review reliefs sought. _____________________________________________________ 300k Form One students yet to report - CS Amina At least 309,700 pupils who sat last year’s KCPE exam are still at home even as the deadline for admission elapses today.

A source familiar with the situation described a programme lacking focus, direction and action. “There is nothing much happening. We’ve been like passengers in a car that has stalled.
