Nyamira is set to start the construction of a Sh382 million headquarters that will house the county government. The tender for the modern block was awarded during the last financial year. The county county government is currently housed at the national government premises. Governor John Nyagarama yesterday said there will be a new county headquarter before he leaves office in 2022. “The headquarters that is coming up will be a great step and an accomplishment by my government as we look forward to having our own offices as a county government. All the offices will be in one building to make the offices more accessibile,” Nyagarama said. The construction is being done by Spentech Engineering Limited. It started just days after the construction of another multi-million assembly block being put up by the county assembly. Most county departments are in different buildings outside the headquarters due to the limited space at the main building which is shared with the national government. The building currently housed the office of the governor, that of the the deputy governor, office of the county secretary and a few departmental offices including that of finance, planning and trade. Other departments including that of public works, health, water, environment and natural resources are housed in different buildings within Nyamira town. Nyagarama said the arrangement has made service delivery difficult. “We want to have all our departments under one roof.
