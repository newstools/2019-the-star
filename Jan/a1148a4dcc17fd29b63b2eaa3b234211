Harlequins have signed Ugandan international Scott Olouch and Kenya Under 20 centre James McGreevy. Oluoch has had a decorated career in Uganda, having previously played for Rhinos, Kobs, Pirates and Heathens. The backrower was the Most Valuable Player in Uganda in 2009 and was also named the rugby player of the year by Ugandan sports journalists. McGreevy was part of Kenya Under 20 squad that played in the 2018 Barthes Cup held in Windhoek in March. In a post on their twitter page Quins were delighted to have the two on board. At the same time, the club has sent Brian Beckham and Edwin Okemwa on loan to Championship outfit Kisii RFC. Assistant coach Benjamin Ayimba was deligted with the transfer business done at the club during the mid-season transfer window and believes they now have what it takes to challenges for Kenya Cup honours. “It’s good to have a vastly experienced player like Oluoch on board. He has a good work-rate and is a skillful player, who will give our back row options for the reminder of the season,” said Ayimba. He observed that McGreevy has a bright future and will compete for a starting place with the rest of the squad at his new club. “He has a lot of potential, having played for the Kenya under 20 side. He is also a fast learner,” Ayimba said. Ayimba expected twists and turns in the rest of the Kenya Cup season. “We are not too far from the top although it’s early days. We have depth in the team and I believe we can contest for the title going forward,” he added. Quins face Nakuru at the RFUEA ground on Saturday. Nakuru have received a big boost ahead of the match with centre Kelvin Omiyo available for selection.
