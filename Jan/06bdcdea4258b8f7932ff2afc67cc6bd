Nyandarua residents have warned of a plot to grab a 50-acre site for the proposed Nyandarua University. On Saturday, they demonstrated at Captain, Ol Kalou. The residents accused the county administration of leasing the land to a private developer who plans to grow wheat. It is being ploughed. They said the proposed university was supposed to be up and running by May last year, as promised by Governor Francis Kimemia during the 2017 election campaigns. “The governor promised that he would start a university with the first 100 days of taking office. Nothing has happened so far. Instead, private individuals have been leased the land meant for the institution,” politician Moses Kiarie, also known as Badilisha, said.
