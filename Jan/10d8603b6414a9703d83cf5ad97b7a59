President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday chaired the first Cabinet meeting this year at State House, Nairobi. The cabinet approved the establishment of a Counter-Improvised Explosive Device Centre (C-IED Centre) at Embakasi Garrison in Nairobi. Germany has offered to donate Sh200 million for the construction of the C-IED Centre. The C-IED Centre, which will be a constituent college of the International Peace Support Training Centre, will equip the Kenya Defence Forces personnel with the knowledge and technology to robustly detect and safely disarm IEDs. The C-IED Centre is deemed useful especially during the period that the KDF will remain in Somalia where IEDs are often used by the al Shabaab militia. The Cabinet also discussed and approved the hosting of the 23rd session of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) Coordinating Committee meeting for Africa in Nairobi to be held from 2nd to 6th September. The FAO/WHO Coordinating Committee meeting for Africa is important in boosting Kenya’s Big Four Agenda especially the food security and nutrition pillar. Hosting the meeting will particularly provide a platform for the advancement of Kenya’s influence regionally and globally on food safety standards as well as an opportunity for Kenya’s food industry players to showcase their products. Further, the meeting will contribute to the promotion of Kenya’s tourism sector and strengthen the country's position as a preferred tourist destination on the continent.
