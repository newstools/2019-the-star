Bungoma plans to upgrade its roads to improve investment and transport. The county will receive Sh300 million as part of its six-year urban support programme. Work will involve tarmacking and paving, and improving drainage systems. Roads and Infrastructure executive Collins Mukhongo yesterday said they will cover Bungoma and Kimilili municipalities. They were chosen because of their large populations. Kimilili will get Sh190 million and Bungoma Sh110 million. The World Bank will provide the funds. “Bungoma and Kimilili municipalities will receive their funds from the Kenya Urban Support Programme,” Mukhongo said. He said the tenders will soon be advertised. In line with the requirements of the Constitution and the urban planning law, the county assembly will approve charters for the two municipalities. The county administration will form boards to manage them. The projects include the Sharrifs-Police-Prisons road in Bungoma town and the Supermarket-Court market-Kimilili road in Kimilili. The Wycliffe Wangamati-led county has urged investors to take advantage of the roads, once they are completed, to do business in the county. Roads boss Mukhongo said they will ease movement of goods and services, and transform the county. The executive said they are keen to improve Bungoma’s economy and livelihoods, and change residents’ lives.
