Makueni has partnered with Nairobi Women's Hospital to improve prevention and quick response to gender-based violence. Deputy Governor Adelina Mwau on Wednesday signed an MoU with the hospital's Gender Violence Recovery Centre for a campaign to enhance awareness and improve reporting of cases for action. "We have realised that many cases go unreported and are often settled without medical services," Mwau said. She said a study conducted by the Women Research Center and Development Institute in Makueni shows 99 per cent of sexual molestation against schoolgirls often go unreported. "This is because the girls feel ashamed. The fear of revenge against them or that they will be blamed also plays a part," she said. Mwau said a gender violence recovery center has been put up at the Makueni County Hospital. She asked MCAs to support the county sexual and gender based violence programme through budgetary allocation. Woman Representative Rose Museo said there was need to train more advocates to campaign against gender-based violence in villages. "Even with the gender violence recovery center, we do not want people to be clogging here. We need to go to the villages and sensitise the community on why it's wrong to fight wives and even men," Museo said. She said her office will work with that of the county commissioner to house victims who are not welcomed back home. Governor Kivutha Kibwana asked village committees to report cases so that action is taken.
