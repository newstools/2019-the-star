Hotels in Lamu county have recorded 90 per cent bookings for international tourists between December last year and January 2019. This is according to records at the County Tourism Monitoring Office. The statistics show a positive sign for the tourism sector that was brought to near collapse by a spate of terror attacks between 2014 and 2016. The situation forced many western nations to issue travel advisories urging their citizens not to visit Lamu.
