Two MPs have urged the national government to allocate funds to the wards to promote equitable development. Enoch Kibunguchy (Likuyani) and Malava’s Moses Malulu said the Ward Development Fund would ensure governors do not manipulate MCAs. They suggested it be included in the proposed constitutional amendments. Having it in the Constitution will allow the Treasury to release the money annually, they said. Malulu said MCAs currently have to please governors to have projects implemented in their wards. “This will liberate MCAs just like MPs whose NG-CDF is guaranteed regardless of whether you are pro-government or against. The MCAs are held to ransom by governors,” he said. Kibunguchy said the Treasury should disburse 15 per cent of county funds to the wards. “When governors hold onto development funds at the county headquarters, they frustrate the very devolution they are supposed to implement. The concept of devolution is based on leadership from the grassroots.”
