After watching his side fight gallantly from a position of weakness to pick a point following a thrilling 3-3 draw against Kibera All Stars in a National Super League match at Camp Toyoyo yesterday, Police FC coach Charles Omondi wants his players to wipe out their defensive mistakes ahead of Sunday’s clash against promotion favourites Wazito. Police trailed 3-1 at the break after Julius Masaba’s third minute goal, which the law enforcement team levelled almost immediately through David Oluoch. Further goals from Shawn Odhiambo and Gregory Nyapala seemed to have put the result beyond doubt but second half strikes by Kevin Kwasila and Lewis Rampey eventually ensured spoils were shared. “We made a series of mistake defensively and got punished. But in the second half, we improved tremendously and that is the kind of organisation we must maintain,” said Omondi. His Kibera counterpart Godfrey Oduor, who had to endure incessant calls from his own fans for him to step down, rued a lack of concentration and self-confidence in his players for costing him a rare win as he battles to add to the five points they have managed in 11 outings. Earlier, Administration Police technical director Daniel Mkhasala hailed his sides ability to adapt to a change of formation as they left it late to see off St. Joseph 1-0. Kevin Omondi scored the all-important goal ten minutes from time to hand the law enforcers three crucial points that moved them to the top half of the table. Meanwhile, Joe Waithira and David Orem scored in the first half to lift Wazito to a 2-1 win over Modern Coast with Dennis scoring a late consolation for the coastal side at Camp Toyoyo. Elsewhere, Dennis Oalo scored his ninth goal of the season for Kisumu All Stars as they held hosts Eldoret Youth to a 1-1 draw. Joseph Oyugi netted for the home team.
