Champions General Service Unit resume training today at Ruaraka grounds seeking to emulate their third place finish at 2005 Africa Club Championship at the close of the season. However, GSU, who boast of 13 Kenya Volleyball Federation national league titles, will begin training without the dependable middle blocker Cornelius Langat, who is undergoing paramilitary training. GSU will be the only Kenyan representatives at the April 1-10 continental event in Cairo, Egypt. Their local nemesis, Kenya Prisons who have been regulars at the annual event will not feature at the event after failing to finish top of the KVF league as demanded for by the department’s management. Meanwhile, team manager, Nicholas Kimeli, has indicated that they will not be recruiting and believes the current squad has what it takes to cause upsets at the 10-day event. “GSU have been work in progress at the Africa Club Championship if recent performance is anything to go by. Having finished 11th in 2017 and shooting to fifth last year, we are set for good tidings once again this year,” said Kimeli. “It might seem as a far-fetched ambition but this time, we are going all the way. Our target is to be at the podium. We want to emulate the previous team’s performance in Benin. With good preparations including four friendly matches with top Arab clubs, we are hopeful of achieving our target.” The official at the same time said the side will be seeking to defend the national league title. “Ours has always been to give our best in every event and the league is not any different. We want to win the title back-to-back and although we are aware it’s not going to be easy, we are determined,” he added.
