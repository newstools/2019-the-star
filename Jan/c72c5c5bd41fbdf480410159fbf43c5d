Bee farming in Lamu is no more, thanks to the security operation in the Boni Forest. The activity, a key source of income for the local community, was killed with the declaration of the forest a no-go zone in 2015. Operation Linda Boni was launched to combat al Shabaab militants thought to be hiding in the the dense forest. The Boni, one of Kenya’s last forest communities, have depended on the forest for survival for decades. Bee farmers are concentrated in Basuba ward, an area considered terror prone. Other Bonis are mainly hunters and gatherers. The community was the largest honey producers in Lamu. Members yesterday said they were unable to conduct honey harvesting, hunt and even gather fruits and edible roots. Residents of Basuba, Milimani, Mararani, Mangai and Kiangwe villages said they were unable to access hives in the forest. “There is a huge demand for honey but we have nothing to supply,” Abdullah Fayo said. He said many have quit bee farming. “We had many clients but the fight against terrorism has killed our fortune,” he said. Most of the clients were foreign tourists who bought honey in bulk. The residents asked the government to allow them access the forest to resuscitate their economic activities. Elder Doza Diza said donors and well wishers were not visiting anymore because of terror fears. In 2015, the World Wide Fund for nature (WWF) bought hundreds of modern bee hives for the community to facilitate farming. In 2016, farmers disposed of thousands of litres of honey for lack of market. Suleiman Abdi said such frustrations also contributed the Boni to leave the venture and engage in farming. “Well wishers and donors have kept off due to the negative security tag. We are on our own,” Diza said. With the death of most traditional economic activities, the community is slowly adapting to modern farming methods.
