Most students in Teso South might not reopen school this term on time due to lack of fees. Area MP Geoffrey Omuse said many parents are cane farmers who rely on the produce to educate their children. The farmers are waiting for the government to release the Sh2.6 billion payment promised by President Uhuru Kenyatta during Mashujaa Day celebrations in October. Omuse asked Treasury CS Henry Rotich and his Agriculture counterpart Mwangi Kiunjuri to act with speed to ensure that the farmers are paid. “The President issued a directive that the farmers should be paid their dues. We don’t know what happened,” the MP said on Sunday during the burial of former Agolot councillor Magdalene Odionyi at Ojaami village in Busia. The lawmaker said it was time the government adressed the plight of farmers and released the money. Several farmers in Busia have diversified to grow other crops with cane returns dwindling following an influx caused by cheap sugar imports. Mary Amojong, who owns a three-acre plantation in Mugatsi village has started replacing cane with sweet potatoes, maize and beans. “I can no longer rely on cane because of the many challenges facing the sugar industry. I need to raise money to educate my children,” Amojong said. Other farmers said payments for cane delivered to factories was taking too long.
