Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech announced on Tuesday his retirement at the end of the Premier League season after 20 years as a professional. The 36-year-old joined the Gunners from Chelsea in 2015 and still holds several Premier League records, including the most clean sheets (202). "It has been 20 years since I signed my first professional contract, so it feels like the right time to announce that I will retire at the end of this season," the Czech said on Twitter.
