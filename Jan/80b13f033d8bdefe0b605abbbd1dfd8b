A woman was detained at Kilimani police station on Monday for refusing to take her children to school. Lydia Manyasa from Kibera said the new curriculum is devilish and she cannot allow her children to go to school. She worships at Kanisa La Yesu in Makongeni along Jogoo Road, Nairobi. "Nemis is devilish. My Bible says no and even God didn't go to school," Manyasa said. When asked to choose between school and jail, the children aged eight and 10 years said they would rather be locked up in the cell than go to school. The church has no pastor, just worshippers. It does not allow them to go to school or hospital. Manyasa said she wants her children to learn tailoring instead. Click here for the latest political news
