A Form 3 student has been found after she went missing from Mawingu Secondary School in Kipipiri last Saturday evening. Ann Wangui, 18, was found in Engineer town, Kinangop, on Friday. A resident who saw her called her father’s elder brother and former Kipipiri MCA Michael Kirumba,  informing him a girl fitting the description given by media outlets had been spotted in Engineer town. “I immediately drove to Engineer and found her with a woman at Engineer market,” the former MCA said Kirumba said he did not ask any questions but immediately drove the student home. He said he was told the girl arrived at the woman’s house on Thursday evening and requested a place to sleep. There are no details of where she had been or why she did not report back to school. Her parents Haron Kamau and Ruth Wanjiku said they were happy to be reunited with their daughter. “I was so depressed knowing that my daughter lacks nothing here at home and in school. I thank God that my daughter is back home and I’m holding her,” Kamau said. Speaking to the Star on the phone, new Mawingu Secondary School principal Mary King’eca said the school fraternity is happy that the student has been found. She urged students to be approaching her in person, or other teachers for assistance in case they have any problem. “We are very excited. We thank God. We were stressed up. Students should seek assistance from us instead of running away from school. We shall help them,” King’eca said
