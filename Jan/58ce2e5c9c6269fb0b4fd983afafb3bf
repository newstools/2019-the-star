The pre-trial conference for two Chinese accused of conspiring to transfer shares of an international investment company worth Sh1 million will take place on January 31. Senior principal magistrate Barbara Ojoo directed parties to appear in court on that date and released the accusedâ€™s passports subject to them swearing affidavits showing their residence and contacts. Cai Jianxu and Yufang Lei were arraigned in December last year charged with conspiring to replace one Peng Hongwen as a director of WH Harmony International Investment Company and to transfer his 32 shares valued at Sh1 million. The two on diverse dates between May 21 and 19 October last year also procured for themselves a registration certificate as a director of the investment company by falsely pretending that Peng had agreed to transfer his directorship and shares to Cai. They are also accused of making a false affidavit.
