Makueni County Commissioner Mohammed Maalim has warned people affected by the construction of Thwake dam against interfering with the project. Maalim said that though there are those yet to be compensated for their land, they should not stop the contractor from proceeding with his work. He was reacting to a move by some locals who tried to stop the contractor from accessing a site in Kathulumbi area, Mbooni East on Wednesday. Residents led by Rhapael Mbai who is a member of the Committee of Persons Affected by the Project (PAP) are threatening to paralyse the works until they are compensated. “We will not allow the contractor to pitch tent here until the government compensates us for our land. We are tired of the narrative that our monies have already been allocated yet we never see it,” Raphael said. Water Permanent Secretary in September 2017 said that they have already paid out Sh2.2 billion to 1,443 people and the remaining 198 were to receive their money soon. Esther Ndambuki, another resident said part of the works on the dam has caused them diseases like TB and unending flue due to the dust. She said that it was unfortunate that no one including the government and the contractor cares for their plight. Makueni County Commissioner Mohammed Maalim yesterday said that interference with the project will be very costly to tax payers. “You see, Whether the contractor works or not he will get paid. My advice to those affected is that let’s allow the contractor to carry on with the work as we also push for the compensation,” Maalim said. He asked the affected to remain patient since the monies to compensate the remaining lot has already been approved and what remains is for the treasury to release them to the National Land Commission. About 189 persons were affected by the project. About 30 per cent of these are yet to be compensated.
