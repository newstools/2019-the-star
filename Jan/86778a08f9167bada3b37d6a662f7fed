Security agencies have secured six out the seven floors of the Dusit house along 14 Riverside Drive that was attacked by suspected terrorists at around 3 pm. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett says a multi-agency operation is still ongoing to neutralise the attackers still believed to be inside. “All the six floors have been secured and our teams are moving to secure the remaining building within the premises,” Boinett added. Though the IG has not disclosed many details on the attackers, he said the "criminal activity" started at 3 pm when the gunmen stormed the I&M bank within the premises. At least 30 people have been hospitalised in different hospitals in Nairobi following the suspected terror attack. "They bombed some three vehicles at the entrance of the hotel with a suicide explosion. Some guests suffered severe injuries but due to the swift response by our officers the situation has been contained,” he said. Boinett further urged members of the public not to share, retweet or forward images purported to have originated from the scene of the crime. “We caution members of the public that sympathisers have posted old and disturbing images that do not relate to what has happened. Their motive is to glorify the acts. We request that such images be flagged to authorities,” he said.
