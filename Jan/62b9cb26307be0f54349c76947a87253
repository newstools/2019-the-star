Farmers will wait longer for digitisation of the distribution of subsidised inputs. A plan to distribute the inputs through e-voucher system is yet to be finalised for roll-out despite a commitment by Agriculture PS Hamadi Boga last year that farmers will use the system this in the coming planting season. Using e-voucher was one of the innovative ways to save farmers from the confusion that always mars distribution of the vital commodities. But a document titled ‘Agricultural sector transformation and growth strategy” presented in a workshop yesterday called on stakeholders to submit their views on the system. The news that the initiative is still a proposal as the planting season approaches with the long rains expected in mid-February could be disappointing to farmers. Agriculture CAS Andrew Tuimur said the strategy would be launched “may be in weeks or months.” This adds to the many controversies in the ministry of Agriculture, including the revelation that the government may not give farmers subsidised fertiliser. Since 2008, the government has provided subsidised fertiliser. But it is yet to purchase the input as the planting season approaches.
