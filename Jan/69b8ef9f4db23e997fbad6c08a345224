The headteacher of Kasau Primary School in Bondo was on Friday arrested for sending pupils back home on opening day. Police arrested headmaster Samuel Aketch Agola and area assistant chief Margret Anyango Ochinga. The two will record statements at Bondo police station and face prosecution. Agola dismissed the children from school despite a directive by the Education CS Amina Mohammed that schools open on January 3. This follows a court ruling that blocked a teachers' strike called by the Kenya National Union of Teachers on opening day.
