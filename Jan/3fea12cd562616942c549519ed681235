Kipyegon said that his mother, is the family breadwinner and she is not employed. She has eight children. “My mother has been doing casual job so that she can get money for our food and school fees. Many at times we have been skipping lunch and supper so that she can pay school fees for us,” said Kipyegon who spoke to the journalists in his home. He said, besides the fees, he needs extra money to carter for personal effects including the blankets and bed sheets yet his mother cannot afford them. Her mother Lucy Chebet called on well-wishers to assist her raise her son's school fees. “It hurts me to know that my son’s dreams of being an engineer could be shattered because I’m not in a position to take him to one of the best schools in the country even after he posted sterling results,” said Chebet. School deputy head teacher Beatrice Konana said that the boy’s performance has been doing well since he joined the school. “We have been assisting him even buying school uniforms and food at times.

Transmara branch KNUT executive secretary Willy Korir said that the family is living in destitute situation and as the community they have tried what they can afford but unable to raise the required school fees. “I fear that the government might not achieve the 100 per cent transition rate, if some of the poor families are not empowered to generate source of income so as to educate their children,” said Korir.
