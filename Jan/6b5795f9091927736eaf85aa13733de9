Kenya and Somalia yesterday discussed how to strengthen their economies and step up the fight against terrorism. Top government officials, including Foreign Affairs CS Monica Juma and her Somali counterpart Ahmed Awad, resolved to engage each other on trade, security, and cultural and socioeconomic matters. The officials, who met in Mandera, said they would cooperate in wiping out al Shabaab terrorists. Awad described the resolution as a milestone that will go a long way in promoting economic prosperity. Juma said joint efforts are needed to win the anti-terror war. “We’re coming out of this JCC re-energised and believe it will strengthen the foundation for cooperation and regional multilateral arenas whether on integration or in terms of the United Nations agenda.” Mandera Governor Ali Roba, who was also present, called for joint funding of the Mandera Training College. Its construction is ongoing. “To realise the full potential of such a college, we request for joint investment to support infrastructural development of the institution,” he said. The county allocated Sh200 million for the project. The county shares a long border with Somalia. The common border is more than 200 kilometres. Roba said joint initiatives would help the region, adding that facilities like Mandera Referral Hospital serve Kenyan, Ethiopian and Somalian citizens. “Because of Mandera’s proximity to these two countries, this has led to emergence of new diseases, among them chikungunya, dengue fever and measles,” he said.
