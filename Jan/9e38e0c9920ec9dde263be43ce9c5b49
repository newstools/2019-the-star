Retired judge Mary Ang’awa has been expelled from the Nairobi Club. Ang’awa was kicked out alongside ex-board members Joseph Keiyah and Jane Thirikali who were officials of the club. Keiya is the former head of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s coffee task force. “They have been requested to hand over their membership cards and clear any outstanding amounts with the Nairobi Club accounts department,” CEO Joseph Chacha said in a letter to members on January 15. The expulsion follows a dispute over audit queries showing a Sh100 million debt. Members called for a special general meeting to put the club in order and avert a dented image. Ludmila Shitaka (chairman), Luke Musau (vice chairman), Leonard Mudachi, Alice Ndegwa, Yvonne Tharao, Michael Monari, and Francis Maina were elected interim officials. Other officials voted out on December 11 are Lilian Kagwiria, John Wali and Ken Mwindi. But they remain members of the prestigious club.Two other officials — Julius Koros (chairman) and Fred Odhiambo — resigned before the December 11 meeting. Club president and Britam director of marketing Muthoga Ngera obtained a court order before the meeting to stop members from discussing him until a suit is heard. The interim officials have now expelled Ang’awa, Keiya and Thirikali from the club after they attempted to hold a meeting last month. “An attempt by the recalled committee members ( 3 out of 9 ) namely Lady Justice (Rtd) Mary Angawa, Joseph Keiyah and Jane Thirikali to hold a meeting at the club purporting to be the bona fide main committee stands condemned,” the club said in a statement.
