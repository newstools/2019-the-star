The use of cards as a mode of payment is declining due to growth in other payment modes coupled with increased fraud, according to card payment firm Visa. The firm’s East Africa risk services director Nita Omanga said innovation and rising insecurity posed major challenges. “There is an explosion of new technologies, business models, and industry players all clamouring to innovate around the core of electronic payments creating new opportunities and challenges for us,” Omanga said. Central Bank data shows the value of money deals through payment cards such as ATM, debit and point of sale (POS) machines declined by 8.55 per cent to Sh1.051 trillion in the first eight months of 2018 from Sh1.149 trillion over the same period in 2017. Despite cash being the leading payment instrument in the world, payment methods have expanded beyond cards with contactless payments, NFC and digital wallets. Product offerings have expanded with particular interest in prepaid products as channels spread to face-to-face, e-Commerce, mobile and social media. This was evidenced by the trend of mobile money dominating as the most preferred choice of payment especially among the online shoppers in Kenya. Q1 2018/19 first report released by the Communications Authority of Kenya for July-September showed that 730.2 million transactions valued at Sh2.02 trillion were recorded up from 611.3 million transactions valued at Sh1.9 trillion the previous quarter. Mobile commerce transactions accounted for 76 per cent of total payment value, accounting for Sh1.55 trillion from 526.9 million deals, an 8.8 per cent increase compared to the previous quarter. In their mobile report 2018, Jumia also found that Cash on Delivery is the preferred mode of payment on their platform.
