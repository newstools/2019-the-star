Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama will know his future tomorrow as the Supreme Court rules on a petition challenging his win. Walter Nyambati, the Jubilee candidate in the 2017 General Election, challenged a High Court decision that threw out his petition against Nyagarama. Justice James Aaron Makau dismissed the case saying Nyambati failed to prove his allegations. The irregularities found during the scrutiny of votes were insufficient to invalidate Nyagarama’s victory, he ruled. Nyambati then moved to the appellant court in Kisumu. In his appeal, he argued that the trial judge dismissed the case unfairly by failing to consider the evidence presented. Appellat court judge Stephen Gatembu upheld the ruling by High Court, saying the appeal lacked merit and was filed at the wrong registry.He also said the petitioner introduced new evidence not in the petition The former candidate moved to the apex court to overturn the rulings. Nyambati was Nyagarama’s closest rival after he garnered 58,936 votes. The ODM governor won the election with 65,161 votes.
