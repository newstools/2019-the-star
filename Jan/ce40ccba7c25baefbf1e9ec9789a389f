Classic 105 presenter Maina Kageni has encouraged Kenyan artistes to release credible music if they want to have their music played in the media. This is after the Internet was stirred by a discussion of Kenyan media not playing Kenyan music. The discussion was started off by rapper Khaligraph Jones, when he offered to pay tickets for Kenyan media to tour Nigeria and see if the artistes whose music they have been playing will recognise them. Daddy Owen posted: “Editor ndio predator, manager ndio damager, producer ndio reducer, promoter ndio demoter, publisher ndio punisher.” Maina Kageni responded: “I agree! But tell your contemporaries to give us content that will PUSH foreigners off our playlists. You are highly rotated. Advise them what they need to do to be the next.” A hashtag #playKenyanMusic was created, sparking online debate.
