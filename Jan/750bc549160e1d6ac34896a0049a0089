Kajiado Governor Joseph Lenku on yesterday accused an unnamed politician of dividing the county along ethnic lines. Lenku, who spoke in Kitengela town after a church service at St Monica Catholic Church and before distributing food to 600 less fortunate families, said he had details of the alleged plot to tarnish his name and his achievements. “It has come to my knowledge that as I continue to unite the people of Kajiado, there is this one politician who is planting seeds of discord among the tribes living in this county,” Lenku said. Although the governor did not name names, a war of words has been brewing between him and Kajiado East MP Peris Tobiko, who has vowed to “teach Lenku a lesson” for allegedly plundering Kaputiei community resources. Lenku said, “Politics of hate has never been in my political agenda. I am only urging you to ignore such people and help me build your economy as a region.” The governor said he fully support President Uhuru Kenyatta’s ambition to leave a legacy of unity after the famous handshake last year with opposition leader Raila Odinga. He said it pains him to learn that as he is uniting the people regardless of their creed, tribe or colour, one leader is bringing down bridges for political mileage. “What political mileage will that person gain if their agenda is to divide the county into clan blocs and preaching hate against other tribes?” asked the governor. Last year in December during a thanksgiving for Kaputiei North MCA Joshua Olowuasa, Tobiko arrived at the function seconds after Lenku had left, and decided to attack the governor publicly and alleging he is plundering resources in her constituency with an aim of benefiting his Kisonko community from Kajiado South. But Lenku has steered off from her attacks, and even refused to comment on her allegations. Tobiko told Lenku to prepare for a political fight for the top seat in 2022.
