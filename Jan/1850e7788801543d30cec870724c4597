Fifty workers of the Northern Collector Tunnel being constructed in Murang’a have walked off the job over what they call poor working conditions. The workers, who took to the streets in Gatanga subcounty, said they want to sign an agreement with the Chinese company, Gezhouba Group, constructing the tunnel. They want the company to clearly spell out their terms of engagement to improve their working conditions. Worker James Ng’ang’a yesterday said they are forced to work nine hours every day instead of eight and are denied overtime allowances. “The extra hour should be paid as overtime and should not be taxable,” he sad. The workers also demanded protective gear required under the Occupational Health and Safety Act. They said they only have helmets but their health is at risk as they lack other other vital gear such as masks.”We are also asking the company not to victimise any of us for demanding for our constitutional rights,” he added.
