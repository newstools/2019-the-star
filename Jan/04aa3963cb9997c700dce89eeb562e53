Nairobi MCAs yesterday criticised Ferdinand Waititu for asking Kikuyus to elect one of their own as governor of the city in 2022. Waithaka’s Anthony Kiragu and his colleagues said Nairobi is a cosmopolitan city. Waititu made the remark at the weekend. Speaking to reporters at City Hall, the MCAs condemned the Kiambu governor and said his comments on the ban of 14-seater matatu were unwelcome. The government has banned licensing of new 14-seater matatus in Nairobi. Waititu said the ban should be suspended for another 10 years. “The law barring 14-seater matatus from the city was passed in 2010 when Waititu was MP for Embakasi. It has nothing to do with the governor of the city,” Kiragu said. The ban was to take effect in December 2016 but was suspended by President Uhuru Kenyatta for two years. Kiragu said Waititu had become a stumbling block in the quest for an organised and lenient transport system. The ban is meant to enhance security and boost business. “We are aware that Waititu thrives on chaos and madness, but we will not entertain that in the city,” Kiragu said. Last year, Waititu asked Governor Mike Sonko to stop demolishing buildings on riparian land and instead divert rivers. Sonko told him off and asked him to stop meddling in Nairobi’s affairs. MCAs asked Waititu to focus on Kiambu. “Nairobi is not an extension of Kiambu,” Roysambu MCAPeter Warutere said.
