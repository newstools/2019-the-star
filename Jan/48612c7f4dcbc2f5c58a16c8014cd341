Telkom captain Tracy Karanja believes change in their technical bench will not stop them from defending both the local league and the Africa Club Championship titles this year. Karanja sentiments comes after acclaimed coach Jos Openda retired and paved way for the quartet of former players including Josephine Ataro, Rose Mbulo, Jackline Atieno and Judy Apiyo to take up the head coach role. Speaking yesterday at the City Park Stadium during the StarTimes Sports Personality of the Month award ceremony, Karanja said change at the helm will not change anything but make the team better. Karanja said: “We expect to do even better with the new coaches. I mean the new faces have worked under Openda for over five years and will only continue with his legacy. Let us just say they have learned from the best and we are in safe hands going forward.” She added: “Our goal has always been to finish the season unbeaten without conceding a goal and we will be going all the way even as we seek to defend the league title for a record 22nd time.” On her part Ataro, who is favoured for the head coach position among the four, conceded it will be tough to keep up with Openda’s pace but was quick to note that given a chance any of them will be up to the challenge. “Generally, we are all ambitious and eyeing the head coach position and whoever the management will settle on, we will support her. I know it will not be easy and we will have to be given time but all in all Openda has shown us the way. Ours will be to embrace the role and deliver,” said Ataro, herself a national team goal-keeping trainer. Openda revealed that they will field a feeder team in this year’s KHU Super League. He said: “I will be behind the scenes but I know these four coaches will deliver. We are keen to field a second team to the lower tier which will act as feeder to the senior team.”
