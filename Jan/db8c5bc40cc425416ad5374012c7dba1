After months of inactivity in the local cricket scene, action resumes this weekend with the start of the NPCA twenty20 tournament. Since the end of the NPCA 50 Overs league in early November, Kenyan cricket fans were tossed around the courts following as different factions fought for the control of Cricket Kenya before Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa called on them to put their house in order. One section of the Cricket Kenya Interim Committee that had been formed by the CS had taken another section of the committee to court over who was to run cricket matters in the country, something that stalled the game in the country for months. With the end of the stalemate last month, cricket fans and players are expected to have something to ponder about on the pitches from Sunday when the T20 action bowls off in Nairobi with defending champions Kanbis away to Ruaraka. For the first time, the organisers have introduced Super Over in the tournament. A Super Over, also called a one-over eliminator or simply an eliminator, is a tie-breaking method used in limited-overs matches. The Super Over is a reduced version of the match that consists only one over and two wickets for each team. The official result of the match would be a ‘tie’ but within the context of the tournament or series, the winning team of the Super Over is declared the winner of the match and the victory is seen as equivalent of one earned in a regular match. Also introduced for the first time will be the Duckwoth Lewis (D/L) method. The D/L method is a mathematical formulation designed to calculate the target score for the team batting second in a limited overs cricket match interrupted by weather or other circumstances. It is generally accepted to be the most accurate method of setting a target score.
