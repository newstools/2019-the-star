Watamu residents and foreigners on Saturday flocked the beach to have a glimpse of the first Flip-flop boat made from Plastic solid waste material. The boat dubbed Flip Flopi Clean Seas Exhibitions is currently cruising to Zanzibar with many stopovers to showcase the idea to the world. It arrived in Watamu, the second stopover on Friday evening. Tourists both locals and foreigners together with environmental organizations and governmental institutions flocked the Ocean Sports beach as early as 6 am to have a sight of the unique boat. The Flip Flopi Clean Seas Exhibition funded by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) is aimed at sensitizing the world against solid wastes and showcasing how wastes can be turned into useful products. Among the sponsors were Kenya Wildlife Service, Watamu Marine Association, United Nations, tourist resorts including Hemingways, Turtle Bay, ocean sports and Kidogo Nyumbani. At the beach, hundreds of revellers got an opportunity to ride on the boat which was about 200 meters from the shore. Journalists were also given a chance to take photos of the special boat. Inside there is room for people to sit, cook, sleep and even a toilet which is sealed with flip flopi. Hassan Chaffi who was among the team that constructed the boat said they worked for 14 months to complete the constructions process. He said they left Lamu and made first stop over at Che Shale before they came straight to Watamu which was among the place that attracted hundreds of tourists. “The exhibition is aimed at creating awareness wherever we go about plastics, we need to keep our beaches clean, plastics kill marine life,’’ he said.
