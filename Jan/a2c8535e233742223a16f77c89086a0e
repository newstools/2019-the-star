A far-right former army captain has been sworn in as Brazil's new president in the capital Brasilia. Jair Bolsonaro, 63, won the presidential election by a wide margin against Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers' Party on 28 October. Mr Bolsonaro was propelled to victory by his campaign promises to curb Brazil's rampant corruption and crime. But he has proven a deeply divisive figure whose racist, homophobic and misogynistic remarks have angered many. On a day filled with pageant, he travelled from Brasilia Cathedral to Congress in an open-top vintage Rolls Royce escorted by cavalry on white horses and jogging security guards, as crowds of supporters cheered. "I came here just for the inauguration," supporter Antonio Vendramin told AFP news agency. "I made a lot of money and saved money to buy the ticket, to be able to buy the plane ticket because it's a long way to come by car but we managed to make it all the way to be here on this day for President Bolsonaro's inauguration. We're full of pride." Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is representing the US at the inauguration, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is there for Israel. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban is the only leader from the European Union due to attend. Mr Bolsonaro has been scathing in his criticism of the left-wing governments of Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, and cancelled invitations to their leaders. Click here for the latest political news
