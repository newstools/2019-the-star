This is the shocking moment a furious hippo attacked a fisherman and launched a violent ten-minute assault, leaving him bleeding and seriously injured. Mathew Wanjiuku had jumped into Lake Naivasha in Kenya - home to some 2,000 hippos - to fish, but was caught off guard by the charging animal. Wanjiuku was effectively held captive by the hippo, and only managed to escape after terrified onlookers banged on metal sheets to scare it off. The attack was witnessed by Frederico Genovese, 47, a photographer from Italy visiting the lake to capture wildlife. Genovese said: 'He was grabbed by the head and rattled, the hippo penetrated his ribs, and his two arms were passed from side to side by the teeth of the hippo. 'It's difficult for the fishermen because they still go back to the lake to fish for necessity.' Wanjiuku ended up under a fallen tree in an attempt to flee the oncoming hippo, but this instead traps him as the predator attacks. The hippo can then be seen biting down on his arm, shoulder, and torso before finally disappearing after several minutes. Chad Wright, 31, another photographer, visiting from South Africa, said:Â 'I have never seen anything as shocking as this before. ' 'The hippo found a wide enough opening, allowing it to bite down. Stamping its feet and swinging its head vigorously, the hippo appeared to be trying to trample its victim. 'Some helped to hold an iron sheet up so that others could bang on it with sticks to make noise, which after about ten minutes seemed to work as the beast moved off. Wanjiuku was rushed to hospital where it was miraculously discovered that he had only suffered external injuries. He has since made a full recovery.
