Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has dismissed claims that the government has been hiding information from the media. Matiang'i also denied security officers are unfriendly to members of the public and the media. The CS was addressing security officers in Mombasa on Monday. He said it is unfortunate the police and the media have perceived one another as enemies. "Let me be clear as a matter of policy from national government: the National Police has been accused of being unfriendly to the public, and to make it worse, the media,” Matiang'i said. “We must behave and transact our businesses as a civilised society. We cannot purport to be talking of reforms yet we are still being accused of harassing and being uncooperative to the press." He said media should be supported. During the recent terror attack at DuistD2, security agencies were accused of harassing journalists. “We are willing and always available to support the media. Going forward we are going to share information with you as much as we can,” he said. “No journalist should feel unsafe working on any story or from any part of this country. When challenges arise in course of work, we should be their first point of call." The CS said security officers should be commended for their quick response and the work they did during the December holidays. “I want to assure the country that we are alert and on duty and we shall ensure the country is safe,” he said.
