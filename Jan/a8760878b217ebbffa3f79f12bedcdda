Former NCPB boss Tirop Kosgey yesterday gave conflicting evidence on why a firm associated with the late Jacob Juma was unable to supply 40,000 tonnes of maize to the government in 2004. He said Erad Supplies produced forged invoices to obtain letters of credit to import maize. Lawyer Nelson Havi accused Kosgey of being a liar, saying his testimony conflicted with what he gave to the EACC in 2013. He at the time said that the government was able to pay but had no adequate funds for all bidders, Havi said. Erad was one of the five companies contracted by the NCPB to import maize during the 2004 drought. The others were Puma Holdings, Euroworld Company, Freba Holdings and Hola Company. Kosgey said he signed the contract between Erad and the National Cereals and Produce Board but could not confirm the number of invoices that were forged. Kosgey said Erad also had difficulties getting maize. He testified against Grace Wakhungu, a director of Erad, and Sirisia MP John Waluke. Waluke is accused of producingÂ  a fake invoice worth Sh114 million on February 24, 2009. Read: Inside story of the NCPB maize scam Click here for
