Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori has said he is not afraid of possible expulsion from ODM adding that he is confident to win the seat back if subjected to a by-election. Dori said he is unapologetic in his decision to support DP William Ruto's 2022 presidential bid. ODM's National Executive Council on Thursday adopted the disciplinary committee's recommendation to expel Dori and Aisha Jumwa (Malindi) for backing Ruto (Jubilee). Both legislatures have been dewhipped from all parliamentary committees.
