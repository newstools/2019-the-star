Mandera Town residents have been urged to take responsibility for their town and keep it clean. Deputy Governor Mohamed Arai yesterday said the town belongs to every resident and everyone must do his or her part to make it clean. He led a clean-up organised by the municipality. “Any person caught throwing litter will be arrested, charged and forced to pay a fine. It should not get to that point,” Arai said. The town has been grappling with increasing solid waste, especially plastic bottles tossed virtually everywhere. They are eyesores. The litter clog drains and waterways and cause flooding during rainy seasons. Organic garbage and clogged drains also increase the risk of disease outbreaks, threatening the lives of residents and their livestock. This must end, the deputy county chief told those who took part. In 2016, Mandera was hit by chikungunya and cholera outbreaks. Hundreds of residents were infected and 19 people died. “I appeal to everyone to be responsible and stop dumping litter everywhere. Instead, deposit at designated places where dustbins have been placed. We all live in Mandera Town town and deserve a clean environment,” Arai said. Arai flagged off new sanitation trucks in the Mandera bus park. They will help in garbage collection. The municipality is a corporate entity of the county and performs functions delegated through a charter granted by Governor Ali Roba and approved by the county assembly. It covers Township, Neboi and Khalalio wards of Mandera East subcounty.
