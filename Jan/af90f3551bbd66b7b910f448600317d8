Upon resumption, Murban mounted a watertight defense, cutting out Kiarie and Amani as Wainga scored a consolation from a 60 yard spot shot for 3-1. Kiarie continued to piled misery on Murban with a goal in the fourth chukka. On their way to the finals, Four Of A Kind defeated Governors Camp 6-2. While trailing 1-2 to Governors Camp, Amani steered Murban to winning by scoring five. Murban on the other hand beat White Cap 3F-3. “Yesterday was the turning point for us and I’m glad we prevailed. I must be grateful to Jamie. He did a great deal cutting out Vishal for us. I don’t think he touched the ball at all,” said the sensational Amani. “It was important for me to win the Maria Bencivenga trophy because I won it last year with Samurai alongside my siblings and dad,” he added. Governors Camp were third after thwarting White Cap 5-4F.
