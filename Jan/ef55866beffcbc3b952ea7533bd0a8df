The decision by ODM National Executive Council to adopt the party's disciplinary committee report recommending the expulsion of rebel MPs Aisha Jumwa (Malindi) and Suleiman Dori (Msambweni) has been received with mixed reactions at their constituencies. In Malindi, three ODM MCAs welcomed the decision saying they are ready for a by-election to ‘teach’ Jumwa a lesson. The trio; Nixon Muramba (Kakuyuni), Peter Ziro (Garashi) and Daniel Chai Chiriba alias Bonyeza of Jilore ward said Jumwa made it to parliament through ODM but decided to support Deputy President William Ruto (Jubilee) at the expense of her party. "More than  40 ODM MCAs do not support Jumwa. She only has the support of three MCAs who are also planning their exit strategy," they said.

"Jumwa does not deserve such a severe punishment because she worked hard for the party," Malindi branch ODM Chairman Hosea Hagai Chome said. ODM’s National Governing Council will meet early next month to make the final decision. Party leader Raila Odinga chairs the NGC that comprises all branch chairpersons. “It’s not the MP alone who went for the handshake, I would urge the national Governing Council to reject the recommendations, as Malindi residents we feel she is being victimized for nothing,’’ Chome said. Jumwa declared she would support DP Ruto in his 2022 Presidential bid and has been going around with him since the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Party leader Odinga.
