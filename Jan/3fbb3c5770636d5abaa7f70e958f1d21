A rescue operation is underway for a trapped miner after a mine in Migori county collapsed on Wednesday evening. The miner only identified as Ja Awendo was checking on the condition of an unstable mine which had collapsed hours earlier following a heavy downpour. Jack Otieno, his colleague said they arrived at the mine in the morning but failed to work as the walls had been weakened by the rains. “We had waited the whole day for the sun to come up and firm the ground. After midday we thought it was dangerous and wanted to head back home,” Otieno said. However, Otieno said his colleague insisted on checking the condition of the walls on the deep mines when it collapsed while he was inside. “He is still alive and we struggling to dig him out,” Otieno said. Rongo OCPD Kibet Kirui said they launched the rescue mission with help of graders from a road construction company working on the nearby Kisii-Migori highway. On Monday, a gold miner from Bukira mines in Kuria West died on the spot while his two colleagues escaped death narrowly due to suspected carbon monoxide poisoning.
