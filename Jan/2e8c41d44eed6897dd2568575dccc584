Tourism numbers in the country hit a record two million thanks to the political stability in the country. The stability is largely attributed to the handshake between President Uhuru and ODM leader Raila Odinga in March last year. Tourism CS Najib Balala on Monday said the country received 2.02 million visitors in 2018 surpassing the two million mark for the first time in history. “This is historical. It has never happened before,” Balala said. He spoke at the ground breaking ceremony of the Mama Ngina Drive Regeneration project in Mombasa on Monday. Read: Better tourism will increase revenue – Raila In 2017, there were only 1.47 million visitors to the country meaning the numbers improved by 37.33 per cent last year. He attributed the low numbers to insecurity and political instability. He said the country earned Sh157 billion from tourism last year up from Sh119 billion in 2017, which is a 31.26 per cent growth. “Tourism will never grow if there are no three important things – peace and security, infrastructure and mature politics,” Balala said. However, ODM leader and AU envoy Raila Odinga said Kenyan institutions must change tack. He said it is a little shameful that Kenya is celebrating two million visitors to a country endowed with natural resources yet a desert state like Dubai in the UAE is celebrating 40-50 million visitors a year. “We can expand the Mombasa port and the airport to accommodate bigger ships and more airlines so that more tourists can come,” Raila said. He said once Kenya puts in place proper infrastructure, Mombasa can also act as a stopover for flights to and from Dubai. He however noted bureaucratic red-tape and corruption at airports.
