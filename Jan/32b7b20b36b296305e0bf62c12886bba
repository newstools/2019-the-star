Avril, who turned down a cameo in Naiboi’s ‘2in1’ hit, has said Otile Brown reached out to her to feature in his new video, ‘Kenyan girl’. “The reason I am in the video is because I’m a Kenyan girl and he mentions my name on the song, which I thought was nice, ignoring the context of course,” she told Word Is on Friday. Earlier on, Avril said it’s because of bad energy that she didn’t appear in Naiboi’s ‘2in1’ video. “I was post-partum and readjusting to my new life. I could not honestly be bothered to get my hair or make-up done to record a selfie for a music video, while my entire being was trying to readjust,” she said. “I found his comments to be in bad taste, especially being in the state I was in, so I just chose to block his negativity and not respond. I had someone more important who needed my attention,” she said.
