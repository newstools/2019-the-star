The Big Read takes readers away from the mainstream menu of politics to explore the plight of ordinary Kenyans and the pluck of extraordinary ones. And Star writers went out of their way to get interesting stories last year. One writer ventured into a banditry-prone area to capture a medic’s unwavering service. Another rang the alarm on Kenyans in America raping their own daughters. And one immersed readers in a meeting of young thugs at the Coast trying to reform. What emerged from these and other narratives were unsung heroes, hardcore villains and tragic characters. Love them or hate them, their stories were gripping to read. While an outline is shared in today’s Big Read, below is the full list of best features of 2018, along with links to the stories and writer bylines. A. BEST EDUCATION FEATURES 3.
