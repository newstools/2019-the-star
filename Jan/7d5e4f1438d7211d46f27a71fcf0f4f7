Kuppet has asked the asked the government to build more classrooms and dormitories in schools to cater for the increased number of students following the 100 per cent transition directive. The union’s Narok branch executive secretary Charles Ngeno yesterday said most public schools have admitted ‘excess students’ and called for remedial plans. He said students were residing in Dining Halls at Ngito and Enakishomi secondary schools because not all of them could fit in dormitories. Ngeno said they support the 100 per cent transition but asked the government to ensure schools have proper infrastructure for it. “Most schools have admitted up to 200 per cent of students and we are now wondering how they are going to cope up with the situation. Dormitories and classrooms are excessively congested,” Ngeno said. He said principals were helpless because they had been directed to admit the students. “Unless something is done, students will not enjoy quality education,” he said. He spoke to reporters in Bomet town. He asked Parliament to set aside funds to build more classrooms and dormitories. Ngeno said the government should increase its funding to schools and employ more teachers. “There might be no funds at the moment but we are appealing to MPs to come to the rescue and allocate the money,” he said.
