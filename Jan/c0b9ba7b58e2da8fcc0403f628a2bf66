Bungoma politician Moses Nandalwe has promised to donate Sh5 million to John Waluke’s campaign if he runs for governor in 2022. Waluke,who is also the county Jubilee party chairman, has expressed interest in unseating Governor Wycliffe Wangamati. Nandalwe is known as Mr Moneybags. Speaking during a talk show on Sulwe radio on Tuesday, Nandalwe said he will be happy for a governor to come from Sirisia constituency. “I will be the first to give him Sh5 million for his campaigns because I believe he is a strong candidate,” he said. Nandalwe (pictured) lost to Waluke in the 2017 Sirisia parliamentary election and would be happy to see the MP exit by going for a higher  post. He said Waluke would help Sirisia residents more as a governor than as an MP.  “Even I don’t have  electricity in my village home where water is also scarce. We people of Sirisia need help,” he said. He urged politicians to work together for development, saying the time for politics is over.
