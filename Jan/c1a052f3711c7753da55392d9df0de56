Knec on Friday finally released the results of the 93 students who sat their 2018 KCSE exam at St Anthony Naburereya Secondary School in Bumula subcounty, Bungoma county. The Kenya National Examination Council released the results of 71 students and cancelled 22 of them. The results had been withheld following Knec's concerns of irregularities. KCSE results were announced on December 21. "The 22 students whose results were cancelled will have to redo this yearâ€™s examination .We have already guided and counselled them and they are good to go," principal Irene Otsiula said. The 93 students had complained about the delay in releasing their results, with their parents saying some had become depressed.
