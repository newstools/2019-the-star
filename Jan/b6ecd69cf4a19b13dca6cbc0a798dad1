Tanzanian socialite Amber Rutty, who became famous late last year after a video of herself having anal sex with two men went viral, tied the knot over the weekend. The socialite was put behind bars for sometime before she could be released on bail. Well, Rutty, real name Rutfiya Abubakari, married Said Mtopali at a ceremony attended by family and friends. Her sex tape leaked days after social media had just seen Wema Sepetu’s cosy video with a person she termed her future husband. She was also charged and was made to apologise to the public. Rutty's video has, however, earned her public controversy and fame. Her case is still ongoing.
