Interior CS Fred Matiang’I has said night-mourning events popularly known as “Disco Matanga” in Kilifi must end by 11 pm. Matiang’i on Monday said the Disco Matangas have become a haven for criminals. “This thing called Disco Matanga is no longer a cultural event. Criminals are taking advantage to commit a felony,” he said. The CS spoke when paid a visit to David Kahindi, a chief who was attacked when he tried to stop one of such events in his Shariani area in Kilifi. Kahindi is admitted to Jocham Hospital in Mombasa after he sustained injuries on the head and broken limbs. Matiang’i said the government has records that show drugs are sold and peddled in such events and young girls have also become susceptible to rape. “Cases of early pregnancy in Kilifi are associated with this nonsense called Disco Matanga. We have agreed today and informed the Kilifi county commissioner and his county security team that all these must end by 11 pm,” said Matiang’i. He said any person caught operating past those hours must be arrested and taken to court. “I want to tell them that we are absolutely ready and we are coming for you. We will intensify measures and we must arrest those who attacked our chief and bring them before the court of law,” said Matiang’i. At the same time, Matiang’i said chiefs should help in ensuring parents take their children to school this first term of the year.
