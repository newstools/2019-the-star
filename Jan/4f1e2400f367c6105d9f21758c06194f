Former Kiambu governor William Kabogo has condemned the terror attack at DusitD2 hotel that claimed 21 lives and left scores injured. A multiagency security rescue team, rescued more than 700 Kenyans trapped at the 14 Riverside Drive hotel and business complex in Westlands. Speaking to the Star, Kabogo said that Kenyans will never surrender to terrorists at anytime, noting that the unity that Kenyans expressed was commendable. “I would like to thank Kenyans for the unity that they expressed after the terror attack, also I would like to commend the quick and effective response by our security team to neutralise the attack,” Kabogo said. He adds that the peaceful co-existence among Kenyans is worth praising noting that Kenyans on social media had one voice of spreading encouraging messages. “Kenya as a country is governed by rules and laws, and the set structures must be followed by all and those who think they can cause chaos are mistaken,” he said. He called on President Uhuru Kenyatta, his deputy William Ruto and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga to continue uniting Kenyans. President Kenyatta has said that he is committed to build a new Kenya that is prosperous, secure and inclusive, and in which every Kenyan has an opportunity to thrive. “We will allow no one to derail or frustrate our progress. No one in Kenya today, or at any time, should doubt our resolve to maintain security in our country, our determination is unswerving,” Uhuru said.
