Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua has accused governor Charity Ngilu of peddling lies about elected leaders. In a signed open letter to the governor on Wednesday, Wambua urged Ngilu to stop peddling lies about members of the Kitui county assembly. Wambua was referring to last Sunday’s  public statement at a church in Mwingi town where Ngilu said that MCAs were blackmailing and undermining her administration. Ngilu said the MCAs were not happy because she had rejected their demands to be taken on lavish and luxurious retreats using public funds. “Lying to the people that the MCAs were demanding to be given money to travel to Mombasa every weekend is the cheapest lie from a  governor,” the senator said.
