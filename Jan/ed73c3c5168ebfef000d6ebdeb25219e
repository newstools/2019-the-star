Turkana MPs have dismissed claims by their Tiaty counterpart William Kamket that Kapedo town is in Baringo. James Lomenen (Turkana South) and Ali Lokiru (Turkana East) warned that the remarks by Kamket,who claims that the court ruled that Kapedo is in Tiaty, Baringo, will scuttle the prevailing peace. Five people died last May and several others injured in Kapedo attacks between the warring Pokot and Turkana communities. A video of Kamket went viral on social media claiming that it is clear the court ruled Kapedo is in Baringo and not in Turkana as stated by Turkana leaders. “The case of Kapedo boundary issue was ruled out by the court to be in Baringo county. Turkana leaders are aware and they don’t want to tell their people the truth,” Kamket said in his video that went viral on social media last week. Lokiru decried that it is an unfortunate statement from a leader who read the court verdict and is misleading the community. “Your statement is calculated to scuttle the peace process, you have started the drums of war and we hope security agents are awake,” Lokiru said. “It is archaic and barbaric to undermine the peace initiative that is prevailing between Turkana and Pokot living in East Pokot in Baringo and West Pokot,” Lomenen said. He said Constitution of Kenya has given powers and mandate to IEBC to carry out delimitation of boundaries for constituencies and counties. “The court directed that boundaries should not be tampered with. They further directed the state to protect the people of Turkana county both internally and externally,” Lomen said.
