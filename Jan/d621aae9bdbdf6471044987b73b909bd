The 10-year-old Kachok dumpsite in Kisumu, the biggest landfill in Nyanza, will be cleared before the end of April and it will be transformed into a park. City manager Doris Ombara said Ombara told the Star the dump will be flattened in two months depending on the weather. Relocation to a quarry pit in Kajulu had been challenged on grounds of environmental damage. The second phase of the Sh200 million project started in November and is being done by Naya Holding Limited. “Half of the 8,400 trips to transfer garbage is complete,” Ombara said. Two godowns will be set up to temporarily handle waste management and separation as a new site is put in place. Speaking when he flagged off the project, Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said he was committed to making the city clean. The new dumpsite will ensure there is no leakage and hazardous materials will not be dumped there.
