One person has been arrested in connection with the murder of a man in Likia area in Njoro on Thursday morning. Tension was high in the area as irate locals held protest accusing members of a neighbouring community of the murder. The man was trailing his livestock at 2am when he was attacked by suspected rustlers from a neighbouring community. Nakuru county commander Hassan Barua and commissioner Joshua Nkanatha, however, said they're treating the incident as an ordinary crime. The two county bosses said calm has been restored after several police officers were deployed in the area. "We urge the residents to treat the incident as a criminal one. We are still pursuing the other criminals and they will be brought to book," said Barua. He said police are looking for the missing body parts of the deceased person. Barua and Nkanatha said they will summon a few leaders to record statements on the incident. "We have launched investigations and will summon some leaders to come and write statements which will boost our investigations," he said. At the scene were Njoro MP Charity Kathambi, Molo former MP Joseph Kiuna and various administrators. The residents said the 32-year-old man was stabbed in the stomach and neck with a machete by the killers. The agitated residents blocked the Njoro Mau Narok road for more than two hours using stones and figs condemning the laxity of the police. Traffic along the road was disrupted for hours as police tried to calm the crowd and clear the road. Njoro OCPD Charity Dorcas said the two out of 10 sheep had been recovered.
