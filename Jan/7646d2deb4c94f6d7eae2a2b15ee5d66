The High court has ordered expeditious hearing of a matter in which New KCC boss Nixon Sigei and two others are accused of financial mismanagement. Petitioner Peter Ombati, a former employee, through lawyer Wilberforce Khalwale asked the court to give orders requiring Sigei and the two to step aside pending hearing and determination of the case. He said they could interfere with crucial evidence. “Your honour, we pray that you give orders Sigei and the two to be suspended since they are facing corruption allegations until the matter is determined”, Khalwale told the court. He said the matter has been in court since last year without a hearing. However Sigei, Magdalene Muthoka and Samuel Ichura argued that the court should be fair and allow them to be heard since. Justice Hedwig Ong’undi directed the parties to file their submissions and serve within 14 days. “The court has noted that this case has taken long in court and being a corruption case, it should be heard expeditiously and concluded immediately. Let the parties file their submissions and appear in court on February 5 for highlighting”, Ong’undi said. According to court documents, Sigei and Muthoka colluded and, without following due process, authorised the transfer of about Sh475 million employees’ contributions from Liberty Life Assurance Company to Britam. The petitioner said the transfer of the colossal amount without members’ consent amounted to corruption.
