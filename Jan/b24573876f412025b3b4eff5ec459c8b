Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa has challenged Governors and MPs to step up the fight against corruption in the country. The CS told the leaders to support President Uhuru Kenyatta's vigour and zeal to end corruption. Speaking on Saturday at Chemororoch Secondary in West Pokot where he joined county leaders in inspecting development projects, Wamalwa singled out corruption as the biggest threat to devolution but faulted how it is being fought. “The national government alone cannot win the war on corruption. We must have county governments as partners to deal with the menace once and for all,” he said. He said he fully supports President Uhuru Kenyatta’s renewed war against the vice. "I think we must work together. We can start from the family level by instilling the best values in our children and then scale it to our county governments," he said. The CS warned the county bosses against misuse of public money meant to improve services. “We want zero tolerance to corruption. We would like to see the war on corruption adopted in the counties. We want funds given to the counties to go towards improving the livelihood of the people,” Wamalwa said.
