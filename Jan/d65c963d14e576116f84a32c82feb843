A businessman being investigated for allegedly acquiring in excess of Sh1.5 billion has sued to stop his prosecution. Also sought by Benson Masila is an order stopping government agents from seizing or in any way interfering with his properties, pending determination of his case. He has sued the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, Director of Public Prosecutions, Director of Criminal Investigations, the Attorney General and the chief magistrates court Milimani. The case was presented by Masila, Zipporah Muteti, Mumbe Junior Academy, Mumbe Girls High School, Mumbe Boys High School and Mumbe Hardware and Supplies Ltd. Documents filed yesterday show Masilaâ€™s trouble started when the state obtained a search warrant on December 18 last year in his absence. The EACC raided his residences in Kilifi, Makindu and Imara Daima. Also searched were business premises in Ruaraka. Masila is alleged to have acquired wealth fraudulently through corrupt payments made to him as a public servant. Masila says his work as the regional manager of Kenya Rural Roads Authority has been hampered because he does not have computers, his mobile phones, ATM cards, office and personal cheque books. In an affidavit Masila says the account through which the alleged bribe was received is not personal. He told the court his family undertakes separate full time business majorly in education sector. Masila, an engineer, was employed by the government in 1993. He has held the position of a regional manager for designated large projects since 2009. He earns a monthly salary of Sh390,000, he additionally earns Sh750,000 in allowances from projects he supervises on monthly basis. In total he takes home Sh1.1 million monthly. Masila says the EACC and other state agencies did not issue him a notice before seeking a search warrant. He wants Sh3 million in cash, 750 Ethiopian Birr, which the officers took during the search be handed to him.
