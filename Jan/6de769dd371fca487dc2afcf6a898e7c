The government has been asked to reintroduce technical secondary schools to realise the country’s industrialisation dreams. Nanyuki Boys High School principal Oliver Minishi said it was ill-advised to abolish technical schools when the country was laying grounds to become an industrial nation by 2030. Manufacturing is one of the pillars of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda. Technical secondary schools were scrapped years ago, leaving individual schools to introduce optional technical subjects. Upon being transferred to Nanyuki Boys early last year, Minishi introduced Aviation course and has introduced studies on Electricity   this year. “It is the high time educationists considered the importance of technical subjects in secondary schools to lay a firm foundation for students who would wish to pursue such careers after school,” Minishi said. The principal, who was posted to Nanyuki after a long stint at Kakamega High School, said students taking technical subjects perform better in KCSE. “All the students who were taking Woodwork at Nanyuki High School last year scored grade A in the subject and only one had a B+.” As a result, the overall performance of the school improved, with the number of candidates qualifying to join universities increasing twofold from 49 in 2017 to 100 in the 2018  KCSE, he said. Minishi spoke at the school on Saturday during celebrations for improved KCSE results from a mean score of 5.8 in 2017 to 6.7 last year. It was double celebration as the school received a Sh13.5 million bus from Scania vehicle manufacturers. He said the bus will motivate students to perform well in national exams through educational tours. “We aim to uplift the school to national status through infrastructural development,” Board of Management chairman Robert Mungai said. He said the school has in the past been known for the negative activities but that will be a thing of the past with the new plan on improvement.
