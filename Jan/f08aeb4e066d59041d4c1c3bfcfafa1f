Some Garissa women MCAs, led by Katra Iman, have defended the recruitment of mapping assistants for the upcoming August population and housing census. They said the December recruitment was fair and only the most suitable applicants were picked. An induction programme for the assistants started on January 3 in Machakos. On Tuesday, some MCAs said the process was mired in corruption and nepotism. They included Daud Adan (Danyere), Adan Abaile (Balambala), Kassim Dagane (Saka) and Hussein Mohamed (nominated). But the women leaders warned them to get their facts right before “making unfounded claims”. “Claims that outsiders were recruited is not only misplaced but a dangerous false assertion that has the potential of igniting unnecessary conflicts among communities living in Garissa county,” they said in a statement. “The 59 mapping assistants are all residents of Garissa and Dadaab, Lagdera, Fafi, Balambala, Ijara and Holugho. Each got eight slots, except Garissa Township that was allocated 11.”
