President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto on Wednesday had lunch at the Barka restaurant in Mombasa. The two were seen eating pilau at the restaurant as they chatted. It is not clear what they were discussing, but the two seemed happy. This comes barely a day after the President appointed Interior CS Fred Matiang'i at the heart of the executive. The elevation of Matiang’i with supervisory roles across government is likely to whittle down Ruto’s influence. Matiang’i will take charge of the implementation and monitoring of all development projects initiated and funded by the national government through a new Cabinet sub-committee. This means MPs will no longer be trooping to Ruto’s office to lobby for development projects. In a clear show of confidence in the no-nonsense Matiang’i, Uhuru also handed him the critical National Transport and Safety Authority, which was initially in the giant Transport ministry under James Macharia.
