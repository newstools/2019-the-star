Elders from Gatundu South constituency have dismissed MP Moses Kuria's comments that President Uhuru Kenyatta has neglected Central Kenya when it comes to development projects. The Kiama kia Ma elders described Kuria's comments as unfortunate, reckless and irresponsible. The elders spoke on Friday at Kimunyu Cutural Centre. In a statement read by secretary Simon Kamau Muhoho, the group said they appreciate the development agenda the President has initiated throughout the country, including Kuria's Gatundu South constituency. They cited roads, hospitals and electricity connection. They told Kuria to apologise to Uhuru within seven days, failing which, they will take unspecified action against him. The MP is a member of the council. On the new year's eve, Kuria claimed Uhuru had neglected his home county Kiambu. He said Uhuru was commissioning projects elsewhere and only issuing certificates to rehabilitated alcohol addicts when he visits Kiambu.
