Shabana FC assistant coach Andrew Kanuli has called on Football kenya Federation to reign in on rogue National Super League referees, whom he accused of biased officiating. Shabana fell 2-1 to Kisumu All Stars but Kanuli believes they did not lose honourably and instead turned the blame on the match officials. “What happened in Kisumu was robbery. In NSL it appears like home teams must win by force but we now turn our focus to the Coast Stima game in Kericho,” he said. Kanuli said a penalty awarded to Kisumu All Stars was dubious. “This is a game we would have won but it was solely ruined by the referee. FKF should look into officiating in NSL. We don’t want to look like cry babies but this is a big problem,” said a dejected Kanuli. Shabana will miss their first choice goalkeeper Tom Muthomi who suffered a serious injury after colliding with an All Stars player at Moi Stadium in Kisumu on Saturday. He was treated and discharged on Saturday night. Kanuli said he is in a stable condition. Kisumu All Stars coach Francis Oduor was happy after his team returned to winning ways after losing to second-placed Wazito in their previous match. “It was a balanced game and I’m happy my boys bounced back from the loss against Wazito,” said the former international. Following the win, Kisumu moved to fourth on the log with 19 points while Shabana dropped to sixth. Nairobi City Stars recorded their first win of the season edging bottom of the table Green Commandos 1-0. Arthur Museve scored the lone goal. Fortune Sacco thrashed Kangemi All Stars 4-1 while St Joseph’s Youth defeated former top flight side Thika United 3-1. Talanta and Administration Police battled to a 1-1 draw while leaders Ushuru and Nairobi Stima maintained their unbeaten run after battling to a barren draw at Karuturi grounds in Naivasha. Ushuru leads the log with 26 points, two better of Wazito. Wazito beat hosts Coast Stima 2-0 thanks to Teddy Osok and Joe Waithira’s strikes.
