Ruto on Sunday said politics of splinter groups and factions was long gone and the government is committed to uniting the whole country. “We know the press is in business, but they should stop lying to Kenyans about the perceived differences in Jubilee,” he said. Ruto directed Jubilee elected leaders to focus on the government’s Big Four agenda and stop politicking. “We are fully behind the President’s Big Four agenda and all our leaders should now focus on development as part of meeting our manifestation,” he said. The DP said plans are underway to build an industrial park in Naivasha. “Already we have companies that are eager to invest in various sectors like leather in the industrial park, which has already been identified,” he said. Some 30 lawmakers, including host Jane Kihara, were present. “We shall continue to support the DP in his endeavours. He is a hardworking person,” Kihara said. Kiambu governor Ferdinand Waititu said the ongoing politics in Jubilee is normal and will “soon cool down”. He said Central Kenya is fully behind Ruto’s 2022 ambitions and the handshake will not change that. “We should, however, bring down the political temperatures in the country and focus on development. It’s too early to start politicking,” he said. Nakuru governor Lee Kinyanjui praised the national government for initiating development projects in his county. “We shall continue praying for the President and the DP as they continue to serve the country,” he said.
