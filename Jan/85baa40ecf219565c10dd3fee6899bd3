Suba North deputy AP commander Elias Wasonga said officers were tipped off by the public who informed them the duo were ferrying the drugs using a boat from Tanzania The two managed to travel to Remba Island and hurriedly offloaded the drugs from the boat and temporarily hid them in a deserted house on the island.
