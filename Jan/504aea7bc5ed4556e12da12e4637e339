Murang’a governor Mwangi wa Iria has urged Kenyans to stop discussing the political opinions of individuals and concentrate on development. The governor was concerned that talk on David Murathe’s views and his resignation  as Jubilee party vice-chairman has shifted focus  from development issues facing the country. “I think we should be busy doing other things. People can say whatever they want but I fail to understand why we are discussing their opinions,” wa  Iria said. He said discussing individual opinions was a waste of time and did not help to build the country.
