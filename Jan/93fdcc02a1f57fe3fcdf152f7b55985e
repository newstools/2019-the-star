Coaches who want to serve the sport in the next calendar year must register with the national governing body starting tomorrow lest they be shown the door. Athletics Kenya (AK) said the process is targeting to register, approve and license officials who want to work in the country, both local and foreign. Interested coaches are expected to present their details at the federation headquarters at Riadha House tomorrow starting 9am. “Failure to present oneself for this important exercise will force the federation to work with other government agencies to have disciplinary action taken against them. Let every foreign coach take this very seriously with an aim to comply,” a statement from the federation said. AK added they have enhanced processes of vetting and registering athletes, training camps and medical personnel involved in the sport, athletes’ representatives, managers and other athletes’ personnel as defined by the IAAF Athletics Integrity Unit. The statement added that the registration of athletes is still ongoing and is expected to continue until all athletes are enlisted. No clearance will be given to any athlete before he/she is registered with the federation and an athlete registration number allocated. Meanwhile, World Under-20 5000m silver medallist Stanley Waithaka won the men’s 10-km race at the Cross Zornotza in Amorebieta on Sunday, becoming the first Kenyan man to win in the Spanish town in five years. He was pushed all the way to the finish, though, as Ugandan 17-year-old Oscar Chelimo was given the same time as the winner, 31:58. Kenya’s Solomon Boit made it an all-teenage podium as he finished third in 32:03. Trihas Gebre successfully defended her title in the women’s race, clocking 30:36 to lead a Spanish sweep. Veteran duo Elena Loyo and Maitane Melero were a distant second and third in 31:28 and 31:30 respectively.
