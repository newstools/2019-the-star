A Makueni woman who was filmed being assaulted by her husband has been taken to Nairobi Women’s Hospital for treatment and counselling. Margaret Nthambi, the 37-year-old mother of one who had sought refuge in her parents’ home in Yieini village, Makindu subcounty, was on Saturday taken to hospital by Makueni deputy governor Adelina Mwau . Mwau blamed the police for taking too long to arrest James Mweu, who was captured assaulting Nthambi at their home in Sultan Hamud on Wednesday night. The case was reported at the Sultan Hamud police station but the suspect, who hawks energy drinks in the town, is yet to be arrested. “The police should have arrested the suspect because the matter has been reported to them. He is a dangerous man who should face the law,” the deputy governor said. Nthambi said her husband arrived home drunk, in the company of three men and started beating her. He accused her of sharing their matrimonial bed with other men, claims the wife denied. “When I opened the gate, he descended on me with kicks and blows and shoved me to the ground. He tore my clothes and threatened to kill me with a knife he was holding,” she told the Star. In the 34-minute video clip, people are heard pleading with the man to spare her. Nthambi said she was rescued by her neighbours and treated at Sultan Hamud Subcounty Hospital. Click here for the latest political news
