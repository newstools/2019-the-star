Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet on Monday said security officials should work together to combat crime. He said this will also help guard against duplication of roles. Boinnet spoke in Mombasa during an induction workshop for newly appointed security officials. He said better coordination among security agents will boost efforts to serve the public better. "It is important to have a common understanding of a problem [that we seek to solve] in every county or region. This will inform us on what we must do together to solve it," he said. Boinnet said having a common standpoint will enable security officials to find a common solution. "When we pull from different directions or have a different understanding of what is it that we are seeking to solve, then we are setting up ourselves up to fail. We cannot afford to fail," he said. Boinnet said it is no longer tenable for the left hand not to know what the right hand is doing in the police service. Click here for the latest political news
