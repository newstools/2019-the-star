The platform allows M-Pesa’s 21 million active users to send and receive money across the world using their mobile phones which will be connected to Western Union, World Remit and HomeSend. The new service also encompasses PayPal integration, allowing customers to deposit from M-Pesa to PayPal and withdraw from their PayPal accounts to M-Pesa. Users will also be able to send money to mobile money users in Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda as well as transfer money from M-Pesa directly to bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Germany, Last year Shupavu 291 which was developed by Eneza Education in collaboration with Safaricom, won in the Best Mobile Invention for Education category.
