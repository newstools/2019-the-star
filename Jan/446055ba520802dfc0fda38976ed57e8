Lamu’s only coconut oil manufacturer risks closure due to lack of market of its products. Roots Kenya Limited Company, owned by a local community, was established in 2015 in Faza town on Pate Island, Lamu East. It produces cooking oil and cosmetics, and animal feed as a by-product. It has appealed to the national and county governments to help it to get a market. Company manager Ismael Usama yesterday said they have had hurdles in their expansion bid. Livelihoods are also at stake. Coconut farming improved significantly after the firm was founded. Farmers got favourable prices. The company has 20 employees and buys at least 400,000 fruits annually from 2,000 farmers. It currently has more than 2,000 litres of unsold oil in its stores. It has stopped buying the fruit. “Our warehouse is stacked up. We have so many products but have nowhere to sell them. We try to deal with the surplus produce and urgently need a market. That’s why we are hoping the national and county governments will help us,” Usama said. “We believe interventions can help save it, considering it’s the only one Lamu has and a promising one at that.” Farmers have urged the Kenya Coconut Development Authority to intervene to protect the sector. Some are resorting to other crops. Mohamed Baishe said they have lost more than Sh5 million since the company stopped purchasing their produce.“The company has been of great help to coconut farmers,” he said.
