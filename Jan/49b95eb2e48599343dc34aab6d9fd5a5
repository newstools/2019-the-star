Youthful Wazito coach Mohammed Dmchulla is confident of leading his team back to the Kenya Premier League. Buoyed by their 1-0 win over Shabana over the weekend, Dmchulla said his only target is to get back to the Premier League. “Our sponsors expect us to qualify to the top the flight league. The win against Shabana is a big boost for us because Shabana are our direct rivals,” added Dmchulla. The club was in December acquired by Dubai-based tycoon Ricardo Badoer. He defended his tactics against Shabana which saw seven players cautioned by referee Simeon Ongaga for wasting time. “Our aim was three points. Once we scored, we decided to slow down the pace of the game but not waste time,” he added. Shabana will look to return to winning ways this weekend when they face log leaders Ushuru in Nairobi. Coach Gilbert Selebwa rued missed chances and poor officiating by Ongaga in their loss against Wazito. Ushuru maintained their lead at top of the log with 16 points—one better than Wazito after a 2-0 win over Thika United while Talanta moved third following their 2-1 win over Kenya Police on Sunday. Shabana dropped to fourth with 13 points same as Talanta but have an inferior goal difference. Shabana chairman Paul Mayieko said the club has signed two new players Michael Ange and John Simiyu to boost their chances of returning to the SportPesa Premier League. Francis Oduor’s Kisumu All Stars won their second game of the season thrashing visiting Kangemi All Stars 4-1 at Moi Stadium in Kisumu while Modern Coast Rangers failed to honour their game against St. Joseph’s Youth at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru. Modern Coast Rangers is bottom of the log with only one point. Ushuru, Nairobi Stima, Administration Police and Kisumu All Stars are yet to taste defeat while Kibera All Stars, Nairobi City Stars, Modern Coast Rangers and Migori Youth remain winless after six matches.
