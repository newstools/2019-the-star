A mother of five from Bunyala subcounty in Budalang’i wants to sell her kidney to raise school fees so her firstborn son can join Form 1. The boy needs Sh53,554 for fees, including Sh26,777 fees for first term, Sh16,066 for second term and Sh10,711 for third term. The family also needs Sh10,850 for uniform and books. Consolata Nerima, 33, said she will take the risk so her son, Lincent Aaron Khabamba, 16, who scored 386 marks in the 2018 KCPE exam can join Butula Boys High School. “I have banked all hopes on my son whom I believe will bail us out of poverty,” Nerima told the Star at her makeshift food kiosk at Budalang’i trading centre on Monday. The boy hopes to become a neurosurgeon. He was a pupil at St Paul Mudembi Primary School. “If my mum succeeds in selling her kidney to raise my school fees I will double my effort to ensure I realise my dreams. I appeal to well-wishers to come to my aid and save my mum from taking the risk,” the boy said.
