Over 50 patients were evacuated from wards on Saturday after fire broke out at Jocham Hospital in Kongowea, Mombasa. The fire broke out at the facility's X-ray section at around 4.30pm, hospital chief administrator James Obuya said. He attributed the cause of the fire to an electrical fault. "We have been experiencing persistent power blackouts, up to thrice in a day. We really don't what is happening in this area," Obuya told journalists at the hospital. Hospital staff and the county disaster unit helped evacuate 56 patients who were in the facility at the time as the county fire brigade battled the fire. Computers, xray and ultrasound machines, patient records and the roof of the X-ray room were completely destroyed by the inferno. The room was not in use at the time of the incident. No injuries or casualties were reported. Click here for the latest political news
