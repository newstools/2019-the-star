World under-20 10,000m champion Rhonex Kipruto will highlight the 28th edition of Discovery Kenya Cross Country championships slated for January 27 at Eldoret Sports Club. The annual cross country event will be a curtain raiser for the national cross country championships-cum-national trials for the World Cross Country Championships in Aarhus, Denmark in March. Kipruto, who missed 10km world record by two seconds during the Birell Grand Prix, will be hoping to make Team Kenya to Denmark. Under veteran coach Brother Colm O’Connel, Kipruto left the country on Wednesday for a series of cross country meetings in Europe and expects to return home in time for Discovery Kenya. “I am going to compete in various cross country meetings in Spain as part of my build up for Discovery Kenya cross country. I know the races will be competitive as usual but I will do my best to come home with a title. Though it will depend with how my body will respond,” said Kipruto. The 19 year-old Iten-based runner said he is in good shape and well prepared for the upcoming races. “I have prepared well for the race, though it will depend on how I run in Spain,” added the Africa junior cross country champion. The former cross country junior champion Kipruto has been performing well in local races including October’s Isaiah Kiplagat Memorial Ndalat Gaa cross country in Nandi County.
