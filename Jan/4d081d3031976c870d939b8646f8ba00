Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has told off critics over his New Year Eve utterances where he said the Mt Kenya region is underdeveloped. Kuria said he stands absolved from any blame. "When I spoke recently, I saw many leaders attack me. I have this to tell them, if you are unable to serve your people, don't start blaming Moses Kuria," he said. The MP said even if he will be insulted, God will remain his advocate. "Even some governors including Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu have said their counties have no problem. Who I'm I to say otherwise? But one day the truth will stand," Kuria said. The Gatundu legislator was speaking at Muhoho Catholic Church on Sunday. He said some leaders including governors who are not working for the electorate have suddenly found a voice to bash him. The MP once again reiterated his call for the expansion of the executive arm of government to include a Prime Minister to ensure a wider representation.

He suggested that senators be county assembly speakers to be able to hold governors to account. The MP said the country needs ministers who are proactive and can respond to peoples problems and only elected MPs can fit that role. He urged Interior CS Fred Matiang'i to improve security in Gatundu to tame increased livestock thefts among other crimes. Click here for the latest political news
