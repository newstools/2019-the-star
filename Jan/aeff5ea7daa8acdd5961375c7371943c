Police officers in Mombasa are on spot yet again following the brutal shooting of a man at Barsheba, Kisauni. Shee Hassan, 25, was shot five times - in the head and chest - after a property dispute with his eldest brother, Yusuf Hassan, 26. He was shot dead moments after being arrested. Police said Shee was on their wanted list, a claim the family has disputed. According to his sister, Fatma Hassan, the deceased and his brother had argued over the control of Sh3million house. The home was built by their grandmother who died six years ago. Shee reportedly stormed the house in the morning and knocked down the gate, sparking fury from the neighbours who alerted the police. “Yusuf wanted the house sold and proceeds shared but Shee refused,” Fatma said at their home in Barsheba. Eyewitnesses said at least five police officers took part in the shooting. Some were in civilian clothes. “Shee had already been arrested by police, we wonder why they shot him dead,” younger brother Osama Ali. Shee’s uncle, Ali Hassan and Muslims for Human Rights said police used excessive force. Ali said Shee had no criminal record and did not deserve such brutal death. “President Uhuru Kenyatta and Interior CS Fred Matiang’i warned police the other day not to use excessive force. We want the law to take its course,” Ali said. Muhuri rapid response officer Francis Auma who was among the first people on the crime scene said Shee had no opportunity to escape. “The path leading to where he was shot is very narrow and is blocked at some point,” he said. Auma said no evidence has been provided to show Shee was armed when he was killed. “It is therefore evident that police lives were not in any sort of danger,” he said. Auma said Matiang’I should rein in on ‘rogue’ cops who allegedly took part in the fateful operation. Click here for the latest political news
