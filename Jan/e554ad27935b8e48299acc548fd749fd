Six people died and seven others injured after a trailer collided with a matatu on Wednesday at Ndundori Trading Centre along the Nakuru-Nyahururu road. The matatu belonging to 3NTO Sacco was headed to Nakuru town from Dundori when it collided with the trailer which was heading in the opposite direction. The six died on the spot. County ambulances from Mirangine rushed the injured to Nakuru Level Five Hospitals for treatment. Mirangine Deputy County Commissioner Omar Ali confirmed the accident. “The matatu hit the side of the oncoming trailer as both negotiated a sharp bend from opposite directions,” Peter Kamau, a witness said. Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia sent his condolences to the bereaved saying it was a dark day as most of the passengers were from his county. “I have learned about the fatal accident with immense sadness. The incident led to an emergency response from both Nyandarua and Nakuru counties with the area residents and other state agencies,’ stated Kimemia. He urged motorists to observe traffic laws and careful driving to always secure their passengers and goods. “I wish the injured a speedy recovery. May God’s peace and grace be sufficient for all the affected families and friends,” he said. Click here for the latest political news
