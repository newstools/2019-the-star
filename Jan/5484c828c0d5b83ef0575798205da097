Hundreds of German politicians including Chancellor Angela Merkel have had personal details hacked and published online, reports say. Contacts, private chats and financial details were put out on Twitter which belong to figures from every political party except the far-right AfD. Data from celebrities and journalists also appear to have been leaked. It is unclear who was behind the hack, which emerged on Twitter last month in the style of an advent calendar. The true extent of damage caused by the leak is not yet known although Justice Minister Katarina Barley said it was a "serious attack". "The people behind this want to damage confidence in our democracy and institutions," she said. Germany's federal office for information security (BSI) said it was investigating the hack and said government networks were not affected, as far as it was aware. The national cyber-defence centre convened a meeting on Friday morning. A government spokeswoman said no sensitive data from the chancellor's office had been published. Although nothing politically explosive is known to have been leaked, the sheer volume of personal data involved suggests the consequences could be considerable, says RBB reporter Michael GÃ¶tschenberg, who researched the hack.
