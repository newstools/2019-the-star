Media girls who want to last long in the industry should be passionate and have set goals, celebrated TV girl Lulu Hassan has said. The Swahili news anchor has been in the industry for 13 years and has managed to keep away from controversy. "Most young people who are joining media are doing it for fame and not passion, so they end up doing stupid things because of the influence they are getting on social media," she told Word Is last week. "My advice to them is to set goals on what they want from it. Without goals, you will end up doing weird things that will make you famous but for bad reasons." She also said she is at peace by not putting out her personal life. "You have to hustle and do it in the right way," she said.
