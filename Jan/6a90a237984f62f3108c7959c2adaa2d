Security officers in Kilifi county have nabbed Sh6.67 million in fake currency, in what is believed to be part of an international money printing syndicate. Following a tip-off, police raided a house in Shanzu on Thursday and confiscated the cash in denominations of Sh1,000 and money printing chemicals. Police also confiscated documents indicating that the illegal business could be part of an international cartel which has been in operation for a long time. An agreement form in police possession has both American and Kenyan flags. Part of the agreement's headline reads: "United States of America: Federal reserve notes department in agreement with Kenya government under the authority of Kenya Central Bank." Addressing journalists at the Mtwapa police station, Kilifi county police commander Fredrick Ochieng said the printing syndicate could have operated undercover for long. "We believe there is fake currency in circulation, we urge people to be careful," Ochieng said. Police are pursuing Johnson Odhiambo, the owner of the house, who escaped police arrest during the raid. "He may have escaped for the moment, but we will catch up on him," Ochieng said. A car belonging to Odhiambo, a Toyota Vits KCQ 469W, was towed to the police station for analysis. Some of the cash was already half processed. At the same time, Mtwapa police nabbed 1,255 rolls of bhang with a street value Sh350,000. The bhang was nabbed at a house in Mtomondoni, Shimo La Tewa after members of public tipped off police officers. The owner escaped the police dragnet. Click here for the latest political news
