Former Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) vice chairman Sasha Mutai has promised radical surgery of the sport if elected chairman during the March polls. Mutai, who lost the chairmanship to incumbent Richard Omwela by two votes in the last election two years ago, said the sport has lost credibility with fans and sponsors and new blood is needed at the helm of the union. “Everyone you talk to says they are not happy with the way the sport is being run and it’s clearly evident change is needed from top to bottom to revolutionise the game that we love,” he noted. Mutai said he had conversations with sponsors who have expressed similar sentiments. “The sponsors are not happy with what they are seeing and have shield away from the sport. They are, however, willing to come back if we can get new people to run the game,” noted Mutai. He said this election will be critical to the game with those elected serving four years unlike the previous time where it was two years. “This is a key election and I want to challenge the affiliates and clubs to elect the right people with a passion for the game because if we get it wrong, the sport is doomed,” added Mutai. Mutai cited the current Kenya Sevens standoff with the union as a case in point of failed leadership. “The union talks down to players instead of engaging with players to look for a solution and its a pity got we reached have reached this level,” added Mutai. Others eyeing the chairman’s seat include current KRU secretary Oduor Gangla, board member Ezekiel Owuor and Homeboyz RFC chairman Mike Rabar. Four director seats are also expected to be filled at the election which will act as an Annual General Meeting.
