A man yesterday pleaded guilty to beating up his wife and kicking her out of the house on New Year’s Eve because he said she refused to cook good food and chapati. Alex Mbuvi admitted assaulting Irene Katheu in Huruma Estate, Nairobi. When he asked why dinner was late, Katheu said she didn’t have enough money to buy the food he wanted, the court heard. He struck, kicked and insulted her. She had facial, hand and dental injuries. She screamed for help, but Mbuvi had locked the door to keep out neighbours. At 2am, he threw her out of the house. Mbuvi said he had to “discipline” her because she was rude and insulted him. “I went out and left my wife at home. We had agreed she would cook good food but to my surprise, I found her just sitting and there was no food.” He said he “only assaulted her once but I ask for forgiveness and I won’t do it again”. Katheu said her husband had battered her several times and asked the court to punish him. Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga asked for a probation report before sentencing. The case will be mentioned on February 12.
