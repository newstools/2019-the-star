Kajiado leaders are unhappy with this year’s electronic selection of Form One students, saying it is untenable and unfavourable to poor families. Speaking during memorial service of the late Kajiado governor’s father chief Lenku ole Mpaa in Lenkisim village of Entonet ward on Saturday, the leaders said they were shocked that some pupils from the county were selected to day schools in Mandera. Governor Lenku said if the selection is left the way it is, the dreams of many children who want to proceed to high school will be destroyed. Kajiado South MP Katoo Metito said he was shocked to hear that some 13-year-old girls from Kajiado were picked to day schools in Mandera. “It beats all logic that the ministry of Education is sending 13-year-old girls to day schools in Mandera county, of all the places. Some of their parents cannot even afford a meal, and here is the ministry loading them with extra transport and rental costs,” Metito said. Kajiado West MP George Sunkuyia said this year’s form one selection should be reversed. Read: Schools to adopt Education Information System by February 20 Click here for
