The High Court yesterday quashed the decision by Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to revoke businessman Jimi Wanjigi’s firearm certificate. Justice John Mativo said the decision in the letter dated January 30, last year, revoking Wanjigi’s licence was illegal. He said Wanjigi had demonstrated sufficient grounds to warrant the court to grant him judicial review reliefs sought. The court noted that Matiang’i had made public utterances prior and after the revocation of the Wanjigi’s certificate. The utterances were directed at persons in the opposition or associated with the opposition. “The utterances leave any reasonable observer with no doubt that he, the CS, was openly biased against the class of persons,” the court said.
