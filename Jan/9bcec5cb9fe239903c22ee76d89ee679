A Kiambu court has granted detectives in Juja 14 days to continue holding a man and his girlfriend who are jointly charged with the murder of the man's wife. Investigating officer Cornelius Arwasa asked Senior Principal Magistrate Stella Atambo to grant him more time to complete investigations. The deceased, Mary Kamangara 39, was last seen on Saturday around 11 am when she left her residence at Safari Park Gardens to Kahawa Sukari where she operates a hardware shop. Her body was later recovered on Sunday at Courtesy beach within Juja subcounty with visible head injuries. She had a deep wound in the head which police said was inflicted by a blunt object and bruises on the hands. Arwasa said the two suspects Joseph Kori Karue (the decease's husband) and Judy Wambui Mungai are believed to be behind the murder. This is after blood-stained clothes were recovered from Wambui's rented house at Four Ways estate along Kiambu road. "A post mortem is yet to be conducted to ascertain the cause of death and to record statements from relevant witnesses. CCTV footages are yet to be retrieved from Homeland restaurant and Fourways estate where the deceased and Wambui were captured," he said. He said the blood-stained clothes collected from Wambui's house will be taken for DNA analysis. Both suspects were not represented by a lawyer. The two will be held at Juja police station until February 13. Juja subcounty police boss Simon Thirikwa said the deceased appeared to have been killed elsewhere and the body dumped at the site late at night. The deceased, a mother of two, lived with her husband at their Garden Estate home in Nairobi. Kiio said police are tracking her missing car, a Mercedes C 200 saloon and her phone.
