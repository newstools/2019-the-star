Anxiety gripped parents at the Ngara Girls High School, Nairobi, following a fire incident at one of the school dormitory on Saturday evening. The school management said in a statement the fire broke out at around 6:45pm in Emerald Dorm. The fire was put out by firefighters from the Nairobi County with help from staff and the neighbouring community. "The fire happened while students were attending their preps. No student was in the dorm at that time, and a roll call has confirmed that all are safe and are accounted for," the management said. Earlier, fears of there being casualties were raised after an ambulance was seen driving into the institution. Parents and guardians who arrived at the school were not allowed to go in. They were forced to camp at the school gate waiting anxiously for word from the school management. "We don't know what is going on. We really need feedback as soon as possible so that the anxiety goes down and if there are any casualties they tell us," a brother of a student told NTV. "I'll wait till morning. I have to make sure that my sister is okay," he added. The management, however, assured the parents and guardians that all was well save for the loss of property. Investigations are currently underway on the cause of the fire. "We are taking stock of the damage to personal property and will be able to provide additional information tomorrow (Sunday)," read the statement. This is the latest fire incident at a learning institution since the September 2, 2017 dorm inferno at Moi Girls, Nairobi, that claimed the lives of 11 girls.
