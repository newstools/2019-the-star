Over 90 students who were KCSE candidates at St Antony Naburereya Secondary School in Bungoma are a worried lot following the continued delay in the release of their results. KCSE results were released on December 21, 2018. The results of 100 candidates who sat last year’s Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education were cancelled over malpractices. Several others were withheld for further checks over suspected cheating. The mother of one of the affected students said Knec and the Ministry of Education have remained mum. “As parents, we don’t understand why the results of our children have been withheld for this long and the government, on the other hand, is not coming out to tell us what is happening. We only wait to see,” she said. “I’m very sad because I have invested in the education of my children for four years expecting results. We have started a new year and we still don’t have the results. Our children’s’ future is affected by this delayed results." Another parent said the 93 students were becoming depressed. “Our children no longer have an appetite for food because they believe they no longer have a future ahead of them. Some are not even sleeping in the house; we wonder where they go. We are even afraid that some may end up taking their lives through suicide,” he said. County director of Education Jacob Onyiego was unavailable for comment. Read: KCSE: Results of 100 cancelled Click here the latest political news
