Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has asked Nyanza counties to stop unnecessary employment at the expense of development. Wandayi regretted that Nyanza counties have been turned into employment bureaus instead of focusing on development. Addressing journalists on Saturday at Sigomere, the MP warned that if Nyanza counties will not stop employing people aimlessly they will not realise growth. “When you carry out an audit in our Nyanza counties you will be shocked that there are so many employees without portfolios yet without enough nurses and doctors,” Wandayi said. The Ugunja MP said if Nyanza counties must hire then they should target essential departments like health, agriculture, and Education (ECD). “Our hospitals have no enough staffs, our agriculture departments have no extension officers but there are so many employees with no portfolio just swindling county funds,” he added. He said in light of the proposed referendum, Nyanza leaders should also review benefits of devolutiont to their people.
