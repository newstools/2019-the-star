The vetting of four nominees for the positions of county officers in Nakuru county hangs in the balance after several groups threatened to go to court to stop the process. Led by Naivasha Professionals Association (NPA), the groups have petitioned governor Lee Kinyanjui to suspend the process until pending issues are sorted. They have pointed to the nomination of Daniel Muthinga as the CO nominee for roads saying that he is not qualified to hold the office due to his academic background. Last year, the county advertised several positions of chief officers including that of the county attorney where interviews were conducted and approved by the county public service board and are now waiting vetting by the local assembly. In the letter that is also copied to the county assembly speaker and signed by the association’s chairman Eskimos Kobia, the nominee is detailed as a quantity surveyor yet the docket requires a civil engineer. Kobia noted that the department was critical for infrastructure developments in the county with the holder of the position being a person of integrity. “The association has noted with a lot of concern that the nominee for the chief officer for roads is a professional quantity surveyor which contravenes requirement for appointments”, reads the letter in part. Kobia said the position of chief officer of roads required a civil engineer as his role related directly to the profession. Click here for the latest political news
