Siaya Health county director Kennedy Orwenjo has confirmed 25 students from Ngiya Girls School have been diagnosed with dysentery. Orwenjo said out of the 25, five students had blood in their stool and 12 had loose diarrhoea. He said samples of the affected students have been taken to establish whether it's amoebic dysentery or versinary dysentery. The Health executive said from the results of the report, they will then prescribe drugs to the students. Orwenjo also confirmed that one student has been rushed to the Aga Khan Hospital on her parent's request. "We are not ruling out the issue of contaminated food at the store. Our public health officers are inspecting the stores and the dormitory for general sanitation," he said. Ashburn Community Hospital and the county health team are on the ground to assess and contain the situation. Ngiya Girls High School Principal Florence Okut asked parents to remain calm as the students are all in stable condition. Click here for the latest political news
