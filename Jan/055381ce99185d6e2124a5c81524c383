Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) Championship enters match Day 7 today with Western Bulls, Silverstone Kisumu and Resolution Kisii hoping to bounce back after suffering loses last week. Western Bulls host Mombasa RFC at the Bull Ring in Kakamega while Eric Bosire’s Kisii side will be at home against Ngong Warriors at Gusii Stadium. Kisumu welcome second-placed Catholic Monks at Mamboleo ASK show ground. Bulls suffered their first loss of the campaign against Monks last weekend, going down 10-27 and interim coach Bram Shikanda says he wants his team to win against Mombasa to keep alive their hopes of returning to Kenya Cup.“Mombasa are an unpredictable side. We want to finish the job in the first half because we are not sure of what they have in store in the second,” said Okwemba. He welcomes Joseph Obiero, Suleiman Abubakar and Derrick Mwambili from injury. Former Kisii RFC Captain Ivan Kanyanya also returns to the side after missing three games due to personal commitments. “The four are very dependable players and their return will boost our depth,” he added. He will, however, miss the services of captain Treasure Odundo who suffered a neck injury in their last game against Monks. Kisumu coach Howard Okwemba expects a tough game against Monks. “During our loss against USIU, we didn’t convert most of our chances. I have been working on it this week and I hope the boys will be sharper in converting the chances we get into points,” he added. Okwemba said William Ojayo and Michael Ochieng are out with injuries. Kisumu lost 10-18 against USIU.
