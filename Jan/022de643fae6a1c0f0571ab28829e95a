Harlequins’ coach Charles Cardovilis says history will count for nothing in the Ngong road derby against neighbours Impala on Saturday. Quins will be entering the match having won their last three fixtures. They sit in third place on the log with 26 points. The Sarries on the other hand have lost their last three to drop to sixth place on the log with 19 points. Previously, both teams have won and lost against each other and Cardovilis’ has elected to disregard past form. “My focus will not be on history this weekend, but to hurt them given that Impala too, are playoff contenders. I want to cement a place in the playoff and create a huge gap with the rest contending for the positions,” noted Cardovilis. Quins will be hoping to build on their 47-3 win over Mean Machine last weekend to garner vital points as the race to the playoff place hots up. “Impala are our biggest rivals. We have a very healthy ongoing war on the pitch. The temple, power, aggression and the style of play we brought to the system was very strong and we want to build on that. “We’ll try to maintain the squad as much as possible, maybe with minimal changes because I’m trying to get some sort of flow in the team,” said Cardovilis. Impala, are coming off three loses and its a must win game for the Sarries if they harbour play-off ambitions. “We are aware Impala are wounded and we know they be seeking to step up their effort. We can’t afford to underestimate them despite the poor form they are experiencing,” he added. Cardovilis attributes Quins’ dismal successes to adding depth of his lineup after signing Ugandan duo of Jasper Ochieng and George Scott Oluoch and centre James McGreevy from Homeboyz. This is besides keeping the current players fit and getting them back to playing shape.
