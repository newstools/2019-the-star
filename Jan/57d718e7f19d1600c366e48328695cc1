There was gunfire on the 7th floor of DusitD2 Hotel on Riverside drive at 6am, raising fears that terrorists could still be in the building holding people hostage. A source told the Star his relative was among 50 people evacuated by security forces at 4am on Wednesday morning. He said the survivor of the terror attack told the family security forces were working meticulously to end the siege. "They are working slowly, strategically and methodically," the relative said. Among the people rescued by security forces are a top politician's son and a former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale's daughter. At 3:27am Khalwale tweeted, "AND my Zinzi is evacuated! I thank Mr Kanja (GSU Commandant) the rescue operations commander, MIke Lekaleile (OCS Muthangari) and the rest of the security forces for saving the hostages. Islamic fundamentalism has no place in the modern world and must be defeated." The police spokesman Charles Owino said there is still an active scene of crime.
