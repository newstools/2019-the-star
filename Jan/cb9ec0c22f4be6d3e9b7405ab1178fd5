Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) league champions Kenya Prisons’ women’s team started training yesterday on a low note amid poor turn out at their Nairobi West grounds. The team is gearing up for the lead and the African Club Championship. Only six players, who were part of the 2018 squad, turned up for the training under Josp Barasa. Barasa said most of the players are stuck up-country due to travelling hitches while some players requested to take their children to school. “We expect a full house at least by at least Wednesday. This opening week we will focus on fitness and loading considering players are coming from the festive season,” said Barasa. He added: “We will continue training here until late next month when we will move to Moi Stadium, ahead of the Africa show set for March 16-25 in Cairo, Egypt.” Players in attendance were — captain Evelyne Makuto, Joy Luseneka, Elizabeth Wanyama, fast raising Lorraine Chebet, Loise Tarus and Herma Jepyegon. Meanwhile, Chemuswo ‘A’ men’s team came from a set down to beat Kimondi ‘B’ 3-2(19-25, 25-16, 25-20, 22-25 and 15-11) to emerge the winners of the annual Chirchir volleyball tournament over the weekend at the Chemuswo shopping centre grounds. On their way to the finals Chemuswo ‘A’ won against Ndalat 3-0 while Kimondi ‘B’ reigned supreme over Scorpion 3-2. Event organiser Nicholas Kimeli said the annual event objective is to nurture talent.
