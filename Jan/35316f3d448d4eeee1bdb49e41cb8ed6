A clinical officer was shot dead on Wednesday night in a bandit attack along Tot-Chesongoch Road in Marakwet East. The killing triggered anger among residents and leaders who demanded more strict measures to deal with bandits. David Kipchumba Kipkore, 29, was riding on a motorbike with two others when they were attacked at Chemukutet, near Kapkobil centre. He was attached to Chesongoch Mission Hospital. Police said another passenger, Julius Mwatu Kilonzo, sustained serious gunshot injuries to his leg and was hospitalised. Marakwet East police boss Vincent Kitili said the motorbike rider Titus Kibet, 23, escaped unhurt.“We have deployed officers to pursue those involved,” Kitili said. Due to heightened crime, the police boss said all public service vehicles plying Tot-Chesoi- Kapsowar and Tot-Arror routes will be rescorted by police.
