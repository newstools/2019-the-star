A 27-year-old man from Kiraro village in Maara, Tharaka Nithi, on Monday committed suicide after his parents stopped him from marrying his girlfriend. Neighbours found Lewis Mwandiki's body dangling from a tree near their home. The people who spoke to the Star described the deceased as a humble person who kept to himself. Maara police boss Johnston Kabusia said Mwandiki left a suicide note. He blamed his parents for opposing his marriage to his lover. “The body was taken to Chuka County Referral Hospital mortuary. Police have begun investigations,” Kabusia said. He told journalists not to be too strict and to dialogue with their children. “He was my friend but he had never confided in me that he had such problems,” resident John Mutembei said. Jane Kathure, another resident, asked parents to allow their children to make their own choices of marriage partners to avoid such incidents. “Parents should advise their children on coping with love matters instead of dictating to them whom to marry,” she said.
