The body of an 11-year old boy who was attacked by a hippo in Lake Baringo on Sunday is yet to be retrieved. The Standard Five pupil had gone swimming with his friends when the tragedy occurred. “We were in Kampi ya Samaki town then we heard the boys screaming for help, we rushed there to help but it was already late,” resident Louise Juma said. He said they found the boy’s right hand on the shores as the hippo had submerged the body. “His agemates said they were swimming when the hippo jumped on the deceased, grabbing him by his left leg,” another resident Dennis Kiptoo said. Baringo senior Kenya Wildlife Service warden Dickson Tonui regretted the incident saying the search is ongoing to recover the body. “Our worry is crocodiles may feed on the body otherwise hippos only bite to kill but cannot eat humans,” Tonui said. He said his officers are camping in the area to help in the search. Click here for the latest political news
