The Media Council of Kenya has demanded an apology from the New York Times over its publication of horrific photos of victims of Tuesday's Dusit terror attack. The American news outlet had borne the brunt of angry Kenyans after they published pictures of the injured victims of the terror attack including dead bodies. MCK termed the move by NYT as reckless and disrespectful saying the images amounted to glorifying and parading the "success" of the terror acts. In a letter to the outlet's Nairobi Bureau Chief, the council gave NYT 24-hours to pull down the offensive photos and make an unconditional apology. MCK said failure to do this will initiate relevant action against the publication. The council said this will not be limited to revocation or suspension of accreditation of journalists working with NYT in Kenya. "You are hereby required to inform to the council of your action within 48 hours and not later than januaryÂ 21, 2019," the letter signed by CEO David Omwoyo read. The council also sought to know why NYT decided for the first time to publish the photos despite covering similar attacks in Europe Asia and the US. The US-based media house had its photo handle @NYTphoto suspended by Twitter for violation of its rules. The attack claimed 21 lives and led to scores injured.
