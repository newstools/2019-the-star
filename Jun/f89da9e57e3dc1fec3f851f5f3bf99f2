Manchester United are preparing to launch a last-ditch attempt to bring Antoine Griezmann to Old Trafford. The France international’s move to Barcelona appears a done deal, however, the Premier League club are reportedly readying one final move. According to reports, United are ready to break their transfer record to land the striker, with a £95million offer in the works. The story claims that the lack of an official approach by the Catalan giants has given United hope, as well as Griezmann’s own comments while on international duty. Speaking to reporters earlier this month, he said: “I don’t know if I will stay in La Liga. “I know where I want to go. I am also keen to get this over with as quickly as possible.” However, despite United’s revived hopes, other sources seem to indicate that the bid may well be in vain. Atletico’s CEO Gil Martin insists that the club have known since March that Griezmann would be joining their Spanish rivals. He told the publication: “I am very clear about where he is going to play, it is known since March, at Barcelona.” It is understood that the former Real Sociedad forward is willing to take a pay cut to secure his move to the Nou Camp. He currently earns £20m a year at the Wanda Metropolitano but is happy to accept terms that would see him take home £15m when he moves to the Spanish champions.
