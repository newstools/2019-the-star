EALA MP Simon Mbugua has moved to court to challenge the new general currency notes unveiled on June 1 during Madaraka Day celebrations in Narok. Mbugua argues that the Central Bank of Kenya did not involve the public in the printing and unveiling of the new currencies. He wants the court to issue orders stopping the implementation of the new currencies pending the hearing of the case. The MP also says the portrait of the first President of Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta, on the notes contravenes the Constitution. In another similar move, activist Okiya Omtatah has sued CBK challenging the new currencies. Omtatah argued that the inclusion of the late Jomo Kenyatta portrait violates section 231 of the Constitution. He further said the demonetisation of the 1,000 notes after October 1 is not supported by law. "Specifically, it violates Article 231 Clause 4, and therefore, they [banknotes] are null and void. They have no effect in law and must be rejected," Omtatah had earlier told the Star.
