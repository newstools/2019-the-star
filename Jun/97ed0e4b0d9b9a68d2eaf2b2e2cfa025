DJ Creme de la Creme says he is marrying his love of 12 years Denise by the end of this year. "I am having the wedding soon and it is one thing I am working on," Creme told Word Is on Tuesday. Creme added that he is working hard on getting baby number three after he and Denise lost one in October last year, following a six-month miscarriage. Crème broke the news on social media, saying, “So the last 3 Weeks have been hard for my Family and I. Pain & Tears perfectly tucked behind the smiles and fake laughter. "I was out of the country when my pregnant Wife Denise called and told me that she’s headed to the hospital and it was an emergency. I won’t lie my heart sunk because I somewhat knew what that meant! "I remember kneeling down and Crying to God to keep her safely wrapped in His Warm Embrace. The worst news came in that the doctor couldn’t feel the baby’s Heartbeat. We’d lost the baby, at 6 Months. So close...So So Close." He says the two have not come to terms with the loss and they need a baby. "That is the agenda for now because honestly, we need one to be able to get over the feeling we still have," he said. In March, Creme took his love on vacation at Ol Pejeta Conservancy, where he proposed to her after 12 years of living together. “I did a mistake for skipping that step of proposing, but I have finally proposed to her," he said. DJ Creme also stated that he is currently working on a project with the Kansoul and Timmy Tdat, but details will be given later.
