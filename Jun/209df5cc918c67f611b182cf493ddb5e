A family in Kitale organised a golf tournament at the Kitale Club in a bid to foster peace among family members. Stephen Malakwen, a senior officer at Kenya Seed, said he came up with the initiative to bring families together and foster peaceful coexistence. The country has experienced a series of killings in families. The tournament was attended by Trans Nzoia county commissioner Sam Ojwang, who urged residents to be vigilant on matters security.
