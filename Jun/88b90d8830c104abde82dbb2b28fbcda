The 13th edition of Henry Wanyoike Hope for the Future Run will be held today in Kikuyu town with over 8,000 participants. The event targets to raise Sh10m which will go towards the purchase of 200 white canes for visually impaired people across all the 47 counties. “This year, our goal is to distribute white canes to enhance mobility for visually impaired people. This will have a positive impact on their lives because they will be able to move around on their own in their places of work, business and school,” said former world marathon champion and race founder Henry Wanyoike. This year’s categories will be 9kms for seniors and juniors, wheelchair races as well as 3.5 km for veterans and children. Last year, the race raised Sh5m which was used for various projects including distribution of white canes and wheelchairs, supporting a nursery school run by Henry Wanyoike Foundation with over 70 vulnerable children and planted over 3,000 trees in Kiambu County. “As part of our commitment to offering a platform for athletes, we have been supporting the Henry Wanyoike Hope for the Future Run since inception. We are proud to be part of this noble race once again and we are happy that the funds raised will be used to ensure that as many visually impaired people are empowered,” said Sylvia Mulinge, Chief Customer Officer, Safaricom. An exciting line-up of athletes is expected at the run including last year’s winners; Rhonzas Lokitam, Kamau Wangui, Robert Ndiwa and Ruth Karanja, Judy Cherotich and Esther Waweru.
