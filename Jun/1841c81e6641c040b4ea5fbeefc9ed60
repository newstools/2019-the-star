BY MERCY GAKII Diani Reef Beach Resort and Spa has further strengthened its partnership with Silverstone Air to boost domestic tourism as the high season for tourism begins in July. The new package that runs up to December will allow the domestic traveller save 30 per cent off the normal flight and accommodation rate to enjoy two nights’ stay on half-board basis, return flights from Nairobi’s Wilson Airport to Ukunda’s Diani Airport, return airport transfers, complimentary gym and swimming pool use along with a 15 per cent discount on beverages and spa treatments. Bobby Kamani, MD of Diani Reef Beach Resort and Spa said the new package will encourage the domestic traveller to enjoy affordable rates as well as have the opportunity to visit Africa’s leading beach destination: “We believe it will be beneficial to local tourists since they are saving up to 25 per cent from the usual rates,” he said. “This is a very special package which will enable Kenyans to take advantage of visiting the award-winning Diani Beach. Our association with Diani Reef is a long - term and fruitful one. We look forward to working with such partners in all regions of operation within the country,” Patrick Oketch, sales and marketing manager of Silverstone Air said. Last year Diani Reef was feted by World Travel Awards as Africa’s Leading Beach Resort and was recently awarded the five star status by Kenya’s Tourism Regulatory Authority.
