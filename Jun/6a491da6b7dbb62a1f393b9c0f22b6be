Kenyans joined the world in marking Father's Day on Sunday. Father's DayÂ is a celebration honouring fathers and celebrating fatherhood, paternal bonds and the influence of fathers in society. The National Police Service sent a message on Twitter, saying, "#HappyFathersDay to all fathers and father figures. To all our departed colleagues, you are forever loved and never forgotten. May you rest in eternal peace." A Mandera-based police officer last week committed suicide under unknown circumstances. Edwin Wesonga was attached to Malkaruka Administration Police camp in the remote parts of Banisa. The service launched a programme to reduce rising cases of suicide.
