The High Court Tuesday declined to grant bail to Joseph Irungu alias Jowie in a case he is charged with the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani. This was the second time Justice James Wakiaga denied bail to Irungu, who is charged alongside TV journalist Jacque Maribe. Wakiaga dismissed Irungu’s application for bail saying it was premature and lacked merit. The judge directed that every witness placed under witness protection has to testify before he can consider Irungu’s bail review application. He further ordered for a social inquiry to be done by the probation office on the accused. Two weeks ago, the prosecution objected to the release of Irungu saying he would interfere with the investigations. They said some prosecution witnesses had been placed under witness protection to ensure their safety. The prosecution has 33 witnesses to testify in the murder trial. Assistant director of Public Prosecutions Catherine Mwaniki said four of the 33 are protected while five are expert witnesses. Jowie was first arraigned on September 27, last year Irungu and Maribe have denied killing Monica in her Kilimani apartment on the night of September 19, on arrival from Juba, South Sudan where she operated a family business. Maribe was released on bond on October 30. Monica's body was discovered in a bathtub at her apartment in Lamuria Gardens in Kilimani. The body was discovered by her brother who had failed to reach her by phone and decided to visit the house. The trial will start on June 25. (Edited by O. Owino)
