Men in Black: International premiered at Anga Imax, Nairobi, last Wednesday. The premiere was an invite-only event. The movie, which is almost two hours long, is the fourth entry in the sci-fi franchise and comes seven years after MIB 3 and a quarter of a century since Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith first introduced audiences to the top-secret agency. Men in Black: International attempts to recharge the franchise for todayâ€™s audiences, with Chris Hemsworth and his Thor: Ragnarok co-star Tessa Thompson taking over, this time as Agents H and M.
