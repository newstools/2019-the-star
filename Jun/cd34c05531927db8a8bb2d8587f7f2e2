Comedian Kevin Mwangi, popularly known as Shaniqwa, says he is enjoying fatherhood after his wife delivered a bouncing baby boy three months ago. "Fatherhood is very interesting and I am enjoying every bit of it," Shaniqwa told Word Is on Monday. He said once you become a parent, there are some things you must stop. "Nowadays things like spending out with friends are no longer a part of me. I find myself in the house most of the times just to be with my son," Shaniqwa said. He said raising a child baffles him sometimes, when he doesn't know what the child wants. The soft-spoken actor found his niche by playing a socialiteâ€™s character, something his director advised him to try. Shaniqwa is now one of the most popular characters in the industry, thanks to his bravery to take on such a gender-bending character.
