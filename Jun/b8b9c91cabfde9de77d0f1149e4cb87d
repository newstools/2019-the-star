Sheik Khaled is likely to employ a new manager if he completes the takeover of Newcastle United, according to the Mirror. It is understood current boss Rafa Benitez will face the sack if the Abu Dhabi-based group take control of the club. Billionaire Sheik Khaled bin Zayed Al Nahyan has identified Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger as possible replacements. Current owner Mike Ashley has postponed contract negotiations with Benitez, instead choosing to prioritise takeover discussions with Sheik Khaled. The Spaniard’s deal at St James’ Park expires at the end of June. However, reports from the Mirror claim there are doubts over whether the move will go through, claiming there has been no proof of funds. Wenger and Mourinho were questioned about the future while working on the beIN SPORTS broadcast of the Champions League final between Liverpool and Tottenham. Wenger said: “I’m very generous and I would love to give you what you want, but I cannot give you what I want because I don’t know what I do.” Mourinho said: “We are not here to speak about it (Our future jobs). We are here to speak about this (the Champions League final) and not about us.”
