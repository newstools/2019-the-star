Boda boda operators have hit back at the Treasury CS Henry Rotich saying the budget he presented was oppressive. Through their association, Boda boda Safety Association of Kenya, the operators said it is unfair for the CS to impose more charges on them with the current hard economic times. In his presentation to Parliament on Thursday, Rotich said he would table a bill requiring all boda boda's and tuk-tuk's to have a third party insurance cover. This Rotich said would push up transport costs in the most common and affordable mode of transport in the country. If the bill is effected, millions of boda boda users will be forced to dig deeper into their pockets to get a ride as riders will pass on the proposed additional insurance costs to their passengers. Rotich has proposed a bill requiring third-party insurance in the boda boda transport sector, which has proven to be risky to the riders, passengers and pedestrians. “The accident victims mostly from the lower cadres of society, are left to seek financial assistance for treatment from friends and relatives since the boda bodas are not insured,” the CS said. But the Association's chairman Kevin Mubadi said they do not support the bill as it will oppress them more. “Mubadi said as a result of current hard economic times, the majority of their members are already suffering. "We are already having it tough with the current comprehensive cover where the insurers delays or fails to pay their claims completely," he said. Mubadi said it would be prudent if the government worked towards ensuring the premiums are affordable and the payment period does not exceed a month.
