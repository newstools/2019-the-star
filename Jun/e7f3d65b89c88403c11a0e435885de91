Former Barcelona and Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has hit out at Lionel Messi for placing his interests above the team’s. Messi enjoyed another stellar season at Barcelona but finished the campaign with just the La Liga title for his efforts. The Catalan giants squandered the chance of Champions League glory when they blew a 3-0 semi-final first leg lead against Liverpool to lose the return fixture 4-0. Barca haven’t been crowned European champions since 2014 and Van Gaal, who managed the club for three years apiece in two different spells, believes their five-year wait can be attributed in part to Messi. “I’m not in the dressing room or in the training sessions at Barcelona, so I cannot judge. I like Messi as an individual player. He’s the best individual player in the world because his stats are amazing. I like him! he told El Pais. MESSI IN EUROPE Champions League winner: 2006, 2009, 2011, 2015 “But why hasn’t he won a Champions League for five years? Why? As captain, you have to ask yourself why the team doesn’t win in Europe. Barca have a fantastic squad. I think that Messi is also responsible for what is happening at Barcelona, not just the coach. The players share a huge part of the responsibility for what happens in a team.” “They have a squad of 30 players and I believe that Messi should adapt himself to the team, and not the other way around. [Pep] Guardiola made him play to the benefit of the team but the last few coaches have adapted too much to Messi instead of protecting the team spirit. Team spirit is the most important thing.” Van Gaal, 67, recently retired after a spectacular managerial career. He won the European Cup with his brilliant young Ajax side in 1995 and went on to manage Barcelona for three years apiece in two different spells at the Nou Camp. The Dutchman also enjoyed success in charge of his national side and at Bayern Munich. His spell at Manchester United was less successful, even though he did win the FA Cup.
