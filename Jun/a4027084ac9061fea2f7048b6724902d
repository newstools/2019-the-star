The DPP  has suffered a major setback after a prosecution witness in the graft case against former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero said he had no evidence. The witness told the court that he does not have any evidence to support claims that Sh213 million was stolen from the county. Robert Ayisi said he does not have documentary evidence that the accused stole the money in 2013. Ayisi told magistrate Douglas he only recorded a statement after he was called by the EACC. He admitted the procurement was done procedurally and within the law. Kidero had appealed to the high court after Ogoti dismissed his application in which he claimed the charges were defective and that he ought to be tried separately. The former governor and 10 others were last year charged in court accused of conspiring to commit fraud which led to the loss of Sh213,327,300 at the county government between January 16, 2014, and January 25, 2016, for services not rendered. But he faulted the charge sheet, arguing that the crime of fraud is not known in law, citing the Anti-corruption and Economic Crimes Act of 2003 which he argued does not define the alleged offence.
