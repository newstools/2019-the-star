Salwa Eid Naser held off Niger’s fast-finishing Aminatou Seyni challenge to win the women’s 400m in 50.13. The time was a season’s best for her which closed the gap on the world-leading time of 49.05 run by Olympic champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo. The 21-year-old Bahrain athlete, winner in Rome earlier this month, moved into a marginal lead at the halfway point and was never headed thereafter, although Seyni pushed her to the line, being rewarded with a national record of 50.24.
