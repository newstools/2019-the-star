Ryan Giggs has said racism punishments are not severe enough and called for points deductions and bans for offending nations. The Wales manager will take his team to Croatia for Saturday’s Euro qualifier, seven months after Zlatko Dalic’s side faced England behind closed doors as punishment for a swastika being marked onto a pitch. Croatia also played in an empty stadium in 2015 following racist chanting and England players were subjected to monkey noises by Montenegro fans in March. Ahead of flying to the Balkans on Thursday, Giggs criticised Uefa’s decision to fine Montenegro 20,000 Euros (£17,253) and issue a one-match stadium closure. “I don’t think the punishments are strong enough when you see fines being bandied about,” said Giggs. “Neil Warnock got the same for speaking out about a referee. [Last month Warnock received a £20,000 fine for criticising Craig Pawson.] It’s not sufficient and it won’t stop teams. It’s a start with games being played behind closed doors but if that doesn’t stop it then it needs to get stronger.” “Bans need to be imposed or points deducted because that is the only way certain federations can do anything. Plenty of people have said it is a cultural thing, both in those countries and in the UK as well.” Giggs has not spoken directly with his players about the potential for racism and wants to leave any immediate action should to officials should trouble occur. “It’s obviously an issue, we have seen big problems in games this season that we haven’t seen for a long time,” Giggs added. “For us, we have enough to worry about with the game so we will leave it to the authorities if there is any racism. We trust that they will do the right thing.” “It is difficult for the players to [walk off]. I welcome the right people having to make the decision rather than the onus being on the players.”
