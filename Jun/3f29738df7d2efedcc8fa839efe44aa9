Kenya Airways has shelved the idea of managing Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA), citing political interference. Speaking during the airline's Annual General Meeting today, KQ chairman Michael Joseph said although the management strategy presented to the Kenya Airport Authority (KAA) was feasable, it was politicised. ''We gave up on the plans to manage JKIA after the whole issue was politicised," Joseph said. He said there are other revenue growing proposals soon to be presented. He hinted that nationalisation of the airline could be one of those plans but declined to comment further, saying the parliament will give more details. Even so, shareholders are against the proposal, considering to the firm to remain private. ''We have travelled that route before. Nothing came out of it. How are shareholders protected in if the plan sails through, '' a shareholder Daniel Kimotho said. Michael Joseph has however assured shareholders that their interests will be protected in case nationalisation happens. ''It is not our wish to nationalise the airline. If we go that way, I promise you it will be different,' Joseph said. Shareholders have re-elected Joseph as the chairman for next three years together with a director, Treasury PS Kamau Thugge. Shareholders unanimously elected John Ngumi to the board to serve for three years.
