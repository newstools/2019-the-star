Daniel James is in line for a bumper pay rise when he completes his move to Manchester United. Wales winger James is on the verge of becoming Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s first summer signing after completing a medical on Thursday ahead of his £17million transfer. And his switch from Swansea will see the lightning wide man land a huge pay hike. James will go from earning £4,000-a-week at Swansea, where he had one year left on his contract, to signing a long-term deal worth in the region of £67,000-a-week including bonuses. James’ salary leap and terms reflect his new status. It is also an indication of United’s faith in the young flyer and the high hopes they have for the 21-year-old. United identified James as a contender to fill their problem right-wing position following a recommendation from club legend and James’ Wales boss Ryan Giggs. They stepped up their interest once it became clear Borussia Dortmund’s wonderkid Jadon Sancho would be out of reach this summer. United were front-runners to sign James. Monaco, Leicester, Everton and Brighton — now managed by James’ former Swansea boss Graham Potter — were also keen on him but his heart was set on United. The Old Trafford club were hopeful of landing James for around £10m after he saw a move to Leeds worth the same amount collapse in January. But at one stage during the negotiations Swansea were holding out for as much as £30m. They compromised on a deal starting with an initial £15m fee. United had intended to finalise the deal a fortnight ago. Those plans were shelved to allow James further time to grieve the sudden loss of his father Kevan last month.
