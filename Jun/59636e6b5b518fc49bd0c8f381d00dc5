Former Labour CS Phyllis Kandie is mourning her mother. Hanna Kimoi, 93, passed on at a Nakuru hospital on Friday. The grief-struck Kandie, who is Kenya's Ambassador to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in Paris, said the family had lost a mentor and a strong pillar. She said they benefitted a lot from Kimoi, especially from her strong counsel. The Kipingor family comes from Poror village in Eldama Ravine, Baringo county. Kimoi was the matriarch of the Kipingor family, a church elder, community leader and an astute businesswoman. Funeral arrangements will be announced later. Edited by R.Wamochie
