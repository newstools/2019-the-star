Lamu Senator Anwar Loitiptip has been admitted to a Nairobi hospital following an attack by unknown people. The senator was allegedly attacked in Nairobi's Kasarani area on June 2. According to a statement by Saumu Mbuvi who was in the company of the senator on the morning of the attack, Loitiptip was attacked by a gang of 10. Saumu said before the attack the two were watching the UEFA Champions League finals at Memphis Lounge within the neighbourhood of USIU in Kasarani. She said when the match ended, she went to the washrooms on their way out where she was grabbed by an unknown man. It was then that the senator rushed to her help after she let out a cry of alarm. The man later pleaded for forgiveness from Loitiptip and later dispersed after he was let go. On their way to the car, Loitiptip and Mbuvi encountered a gang of nine together with the other man all armed with clubs. The gang descended on the senator with blows as he fell on the ground. Saumu also sustained injuries on her arm as she tried to shield the senator from the blows to his head. Loitiptip sustained cuts on his head in the attack. Police have launched investigations into the incident.
