The governor said that Russian National Medical  Research Centre will train county medical personnel in obstetrics, gynaecology and perinatology through simulation by experts in Russian medical training centres. Russian support will improve primary and secondary medical care for pregnant mothers and newborns. “I held a roundtable discussion with a number of Russian companies dealing with telemedical technology and the aim is to invite them to invest in our county in the area of medical and health services,” Ongwae said in a statement. Ongwae is attending the St. Petersburg International Economic  Forum in Russia and will spend the next five days wooing Russian investors in the health and ICT sectors to invest in his county.
