Mohamed Salah has rejected the chance to join Real Madrid and Juventus this summer— but will consider his Liverpool future at the end of next season. The Egyptian forward has been linked with a £150million exit but has reportedly informed the club he will not leave this summer. Both Real Madrid and Juventus were lining up mega-money moves for Salah but now may have to wait until next summer. According to reports, Salah has been tempted by talk of an exit despite helping Liverpool win the Champions League last month. Jurgen Klopp is aware of the interest in Salah and has been involved in discussions with high-ranking officials at the club amid concerns over losing his star man. They claim that Salah, who is currently away on international duty with Egypt, has reassured the club that the timing is not right for him to leave. Salah’s attacking team-mate Sadio Mane has also been linked with a summer move but the report says he has also informed the club he has no intention to leave yet either.
