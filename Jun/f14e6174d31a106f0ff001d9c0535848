The High Court on Monday issued orders restraining the DCI, IG, AG and DPP from arresting, charging and harassing Sang who was arrested and taken to Kisumu Central police station. The same orders were also issued for Dr Benard Kiplimo Lagat who is a county executive in Nandi Justice Stephen Githinji issued restraining orders following an application by Sang’s lawyers led by Senior Counsel Tom Ojienda. Sang was arrested over destruction of the Kibwari tea farm which is on disputed land. He said the land belongs to the community and had been used as cattle dip for 13 years before it was grabbed by some individuals in the area. The governor had recorded a statement in Kapsabet over the matter but was arrested and whisked to Kisumu central police station. “The respondents or their agents are restrained from charging, prosecuting, arresting, continued harassment, questioning, intimidating, apprehending the applicants on any matters concerning the alleged possession, and use and development of a cattle dip on the property known as Nandi Hills/Kapsimotwo/Block 2(Kettchem) 234," reads the order. Justice Githinji directed that the orders be served on the DCI and the others named as respondents in the matter within 14 days. He said the court registry would set a hearing date for the matter. Ojienda filed a petition citing threats against the governor and contravention of provisions in Articles 40, 62 and 63 of the Constitution. The county boss armed with a power saw joined the community in destroying tea plants on the land measuring more than two acres. He said the community had sought his help to reclaim the land. Sang argued that the county had done through investigations and established that the land in dispute belonged to the community
