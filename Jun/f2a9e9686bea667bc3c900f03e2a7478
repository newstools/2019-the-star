Mama Fitness is a programme that helps women build healthy minds and bodies through physical exercise. It also seeks to help women maintain a healthy lifestyle in an environment where fitness is not considered a necessity. The programme has managed to reach 300 women and more. It recently held a session at Lord Eroll in Runda, Nairobi.
