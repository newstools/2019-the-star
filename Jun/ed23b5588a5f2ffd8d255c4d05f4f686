Kakamega Homeboyz have threatened to pull out of the Kenya Premier League citing unfair treatment and poor leadership by Football Kenya Federation. While addressing disgruntled club fans, who were protesting in Kakamega shortly after national team coach Sebastian Migne omitted Allan Wanga from his travelling party of 27 players to the Cup of Nations, Homeboyz chairman Cleophas Shimanyula said they were surprised by the development. Homeboyz management and fans are furious following Wanga's omission despite being the current Premier League top scorer, at least before Ulinzi take on Mt. Kenya this afternoon, where Enosh Ochieng could dethrone him. Shimanyula alleged that Migne did not pick the squad single-handedly but under duress from top officials at Kandanda House. "We have been astounded by the decision of the national team coach to leave out Allan Wanga. However, we are well aware that he was acting on instructions from FKF head office," said Shimanyula.Â  think my complaints about having two reserve goalkeepers from Kariobangi Sharks did not go down well with the FKF top brass." "We all know that Afcon is a tough tournament that requires a well-blended side and not a place for academy players. Wanga has remained consistent and better than most of those selected in the team. We are so perplexed with this snub." The Homeboyz chief also wondered why the match pitting Ulinzi Stars and Mt. Kenya is being played tomorrow, adding that it is against the law and tantamount to match-fixing considering that Enosh Ochieng and Allan Wanga are contesting for the Golden Boot. Shimanyula also added that football in Kenya is fast losing its value due to what he called impunity and poor management from the top office. The move to leave Wanga out triggered demonstrations by Homeboyz fans in Kakamega town yesterday, who called for the government to intervene and save the situation.
