Paul Pogba is determined to join Real Madrid this summer despite Manchester United’s reluctance to sell, according to reports in Spain. The French midfielder is a priority signing for Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane but United have no desire to cash-in on Pogba as they look to build a team capable of pushing for titles. Pogba, according to Marca, won’t be put off by United’s willingness to keep him as he continues to seek a switch to the Bernabeu to link up with Zidane. Any move looked to have been put to one side while the issues surrounding his agent Mino Raiola were being resolved. But on Friday, it was announced that Raiola, Pogba’s agent, is free to broker transfers in Italy and beyond after Fifa lifted a worldwide suspension. Pogba represents Zidane’s first choice as he looks to overhaul the squad’s ageing midfield, but he would not come cheaply, with United valuing the player at close to £150million. The 26-year-old was out in Asia this week with Adidas which highlighted his level of superstardom across the globe—another pull for Real Madrid, who pride themselves on owning football’s most marketable athletes. Pogba has two years left on his deal at United and remains the club’s biggest on-field asset after missing out on next season’s Champions League. Marca also states that Paris Saint-Germain remains an alternative destination for Pogba, with the Ligue 1 champions keen to land the World Cup-winning midfielder. He grew up in the French capital and would be paired with a number of his international team-mates including star striker Kylian Mbappe. Zidane has been provided with plenty of funds since returning to the club and has already added five new players to the squad for next season. Madrid have now signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jovic, Eder Militao, Ferland Mendy and Rodrygo, spending a sum total of £344million so far.
