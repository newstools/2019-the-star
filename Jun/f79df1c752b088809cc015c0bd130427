However, there was a general drop in the food and non- alcoholic drink index which dropped by 1.6 per cent, a decline of 0.37 per cent compared to May. According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), this was due to favourable weather conditions which led to increased food production and in turn resulted in a drop especially in vegetable prices.

Price of a litre of super petrol went up by Sh3.07 and that of diesel by Sh0.39 in recent review by EPRA. Kerosene prices however dropped by Sh0.34 per litre. The inflation rate of 5.7 is within the annual margins estimated by the Central Bank of Kenya in its February survey. According the the Market Perception survey, the banking regulator said it expects inflation to average at 5.8 per cent while non-banking private sector firms said inflation would be at about 5.7 per cent this year. “The anticipation of favourable weather conditions and low food prices, the reduced cost of electricity, the low level of international oil prices and a stable shilling are expected to support low inflation in the next 12 months,” said CBK. The projected annual inflation is also within government’s margin of 2.5-7.5 per cent. Inflation rate in Kenya averaged 9.59 per cent from 2005 until 2019, reaching an all-time high of 31.50 per cent in May of 2008 and a record low of 3.18 per cent in October of 2010.
