Starehe Member of Parliament Charles Kanyi 'Jaguar' will remain in police custody for three more working days. During the ruling on Friday, Senior Resident Magistrate Sinkiyan Tobiko said two weeks asked by the DCI for investigation is too long. The magistrate has directed that the MP should be held at Kileleshwa police station until Tuesday next week. His  detention has been based on the application by the prosecution that he could interfere with witnesses in the case if released on bail adding that the  MP will be detained to facilitate investigations. "It is a just reason because investigations must be facilitated. He will be detained in interest of security and the larger public," Magistrate Sinkiyan said. Embakassi East MP Babu Owino, Nairobi businessman Paul Kobia, musician Ringtone Apoko turned up to show their solidarity with Jaguar. Jaguar spent his second night  at the Kileleshwa police cells awaiting today's ruling.
