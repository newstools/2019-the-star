Jose Mourinho is eyeing up a national team job for the first time in his managerial career. The ex-Manchester United, Chelsea, Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Porto boss has not had a job since leaving Old Trafford in December. There have been many destinations suggested where he could end up but he has now finally lifted the lid on his next step. “I want to compete in new competitions,” he told Eleven Sports. “I think about the World Cup and the European Championships. For a long time I have had the desire to try out such an adventure. Right now, I see myself more at a national team than with a new club.” “Is Portugal the right team for me? Not necessarily.” There were reports that Mourinho was considering a return to Stamford Bridge for a third spell as manager but Frank Lampard is the strong favourite to take charge. The 56-year-old has been doing some punditry work on beIN SPORTS while he waits for the right job.
