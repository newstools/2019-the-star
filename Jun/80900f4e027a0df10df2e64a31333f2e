Lack of customer-experience-focused strategy is slowing down efforts for local businesses to offer a fulfilling experience to clients, a recent forum was told. According to customer loyalty experts mSurvey, for a long time, success depended on a company’s manufacturing capacity. Success was then determined by efficiency in distributing products. However, the rules have changed over the years, as today's customer seeks more experience or engagement with a product. However, in this age of information, customers became increasingly aware of alternatives. This has driven markets into the age of the customer whereby meeting and exceeding customer expectations has now become a key priority. “We are now in the age of the customer and businesses are becoming increasingly aware of the role of customer experience in business growth,”mSurvey CEO, Kenfield Griffith said during mSurvey's third Net Promoter Score Masterclass. "There seems to be a disconnect between the desire to offer fulfilling customer experiences and the actual experience that is delivered, due to the lack of a Customer Experience focused strategy," he said. mSurvey’s Net Promoter Score (NPS) Masterclasses equip business leaders and customer experience professionals with actual skills to utilize customer feedback. The course helps obtain crucial data, perform analysis of customer insights for customer segmentation and identify action points for the business to succeed. The training is designed to give participants an understanding of NPS and apply the methodology within their businesses to drive growth. So far over 6,000 companies globally have undertaken the certification program with the latest version, the NPS Masterclass, bringing NPS into the digital age.
