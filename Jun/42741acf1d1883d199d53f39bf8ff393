There will be no love lost as Rwanda face off with hosts Kenya in their second duel after going down 3-1 to Egypt in the opening match of the All Africa Games Zone 5 qualifiers yesterday at the Moi Stadium Indoor Arena Kasarani. Rwanda coach Paul Bitok admitted it will be a tense moment for him but was quick to note that he will have to do what he has to do and hopes that the best team will carry the day. “I’m a professional coach and I have to conduct myself as one. Definitely, it will be an interesting moment considering I will be on the touchline against my home team but that’s what sports are all about,” said Bitok. He added: “It’s unfortunate we lost our first match but I hope to recover along the way. Reception didn’t work for us today but I hope we will regroup ahead of our matches against Kenya and Uganda. Our hope is to book the sole slot ahead of the Morocco bonanza in August.” In their match against Egypt, the first set was closely contested affair with teams tying at 4-4. However, the explosive spikes from Lawrence Yaka saw Rwanda take a slim 8-7 lead at the first technical time out.
