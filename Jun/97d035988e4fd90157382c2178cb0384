Thibaut Courtois is convinced Eden Hazard’s arrival will be a difference maker for Real Madrid next season. The former Chelsea man confirmed his move to Real on Friday for a huge £130million fee, committing to the Santiago Bernabeu club for five years in the process. He joined after helping the Blues to the Europa League crown and a top four finish, while Real have struggled this campaign. The Spanish giants finished third in La Liga and were surprisingly knocked out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage by Ajax. But Courtois, who played with Hazard at Chelsea before moving to Real last summer, is convinced Hazard will be a brilliant addition for Los Blancos. “If he speaks a little Spanish, it will be even better,” Courtois said after playing in Belgium’s 3-0 Euro 2020 qualifying win against Kazakhstan on Saturday. “It’s very nice that we’re going to be together. He’s my friend, I get along very well with him and his family. For Madrid it’s going to be fantastic. I think [Hazard] is going to make the difference and I hope we can win many titles next season.” Another of Hazard’s Belgium team-mates Dries Mertens also expressed his delight that the 28-year-old is moving to Real. “I’m happy for him, it’s a good step forward,” said Mertens, who was on the scoresheet against Kazakhstan, said after the game. “He’s already one of the best players in the world, and now he has to take advantage of his opportunities to become the best of all.”
