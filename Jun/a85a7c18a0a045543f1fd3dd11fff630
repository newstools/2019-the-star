Jose Mourinho could make a shock move to Newcastle if billionaire Sheik Khaled bin Zayed Al Nehayan’s takeover is completed. The Sheik has made a £350m offer for the north east club and his advisors insist the bid is genuine, despite doubts as Mike Ashley is yet to see proof of any of his funds. And, according to the Mirror, he has his own list of targets to occupy the dugout amid continued doubts over Rafa Benitez’s future. Former Chelsea, Manchester United and Real Madrid manager Mourinho is high on his list. Now the Portuguese boss has told close friends that he would consider taking over at St. James’ Park if the opportunity arose. Mourinho has always liked Newcastle due to his connections with Sir Bobby Robson, who was a boyhood fan of the club and managed them during the early 2000s. Robson also took Mourinho under his wing and gave him his break in football coaching, working with him at Sporting Lisbon, Porto and Barcelona. It is believed that Robson would tell Mourinho stories about Newcastle during their time together. Mourinho said last summer: “I like to go there. I like the feeling of going to Mr Robson’s home. I like that feeling. I like the stadium. I like the atmosphere. They are a good, enthusiastic crowd. I like the Geordies.” While the 56-year-old usually manages sides that compete for silverware, Mourinho is willing to help a club step up to that level if it has the potential - like Newcastle. Mourinho has been out of work since leaving United last year, while Benitez’s contract expires this summer. He remains in talks with Ashley over extending it.
