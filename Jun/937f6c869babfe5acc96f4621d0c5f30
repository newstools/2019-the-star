Tottenham are prepared to break their transfer record twice this summer as they pursue deals for Giovani Lo Celso and Tanguy Ndombele. Mauricio Pochettino’s side haven’t made any signings in the last two transfer windows but that is set to change as they seek to add to their squad. According to reports, Tottenham are ready to make an improved offer for Real Betis midfielder Lo Celso having had an initial offer of £53million turned down. The Champions League finalists are also interested in Ndombele but have no intention of paying Lyon’s asking price of £71million for the midfielder. Tottenham’s current record signing is Davinson Sanchez, who joined from Ajax in 2017 for £42million in 2017. Lo Celso, who previously played for Paris Saint-Germain, produced some excellent performances for Real Betis last season; he scored 16 goals and provided six assists in 46 games across all competitions. Ndombele, meanwhile, was resilient in the Lyon midfield in Ligue 1.
