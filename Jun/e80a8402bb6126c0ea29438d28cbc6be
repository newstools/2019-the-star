The decision by the High Court to reinstate the 2012 safe abortion guidelines will reduce cases of unsafe abortion and improve maternal health in Kenya. It allows a woman whose life is at risk as a result of pregnancy to seek medical assistance to terminate it. We should note safe abortion guidelines were withdrawn without consultations. Consultations should, therefore, bring everyone on board; medical practitioners, youths and the ministries of Education and Health. We should see a reduction of the seven lives lost daily to unsafe abortion. Naya Kenya
