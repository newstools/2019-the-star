Former TV news anchor Janet Mbugua has taken a social media break after a week of online campaigns on menstruation hygiene. “It’s been such an incredible week! A lot of it spent online and now it’s time to be present offline, at least for a bit,” she wrote on Instagram. Speaking to Word Is on Thursday, the mother of two said she takes a break at least three times a year. "I’ve taken several breaks from social media in the past because I just feel like it allows me to be present, and I usually inform followers I’ll be back," Janet said. During her campaign, Janet managed to obtain signatures for a petition that will start a discussion around zero-rating pads and tampons, and kickstarting a comprehensive government programme providing free pads.
