Tetu Shani has released a new hit titled 'AfricanSun'. It is an energetic and inspiring track that draws influences from dancehall, rock and trap, creating a truly unique sound that still sounds very Nairobian. Tetu is a winner of the Empawa Africa competition stewarded by pop artiste Mr Eazi, receiving funding to record and shoot a music video. AfricaSun was his submission and so far, people have described the song as epic, inspiring, catchy and an anthem of Africa and its diaspora. Tetu has played shows in Ethiopia, Uganda and Zanzibar, and shared the stage with artistes like Sauti Sol, Nneka (Nigeria), Toya Delazy (South Africa), and Grammy nominee and UK recording artiste Joss Stone. Tetu describes his music as one that portrays the image of someone willing to take risks, and someone who is relatable.
