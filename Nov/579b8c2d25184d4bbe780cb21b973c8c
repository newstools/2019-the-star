Harambee Starlets claimed their maiden CECAFA Women championships crown on Monday after edging hosts Tanzania  2-0 at the Azam Sports Complex, Chamazi. Teenage sensation Jentrix Shikangwa was the hero as she came off the bench to net twice, first from the spot after Donisia Minja's handball in the box 20 minutes from time and then in the 88th minute to also claim the Golden Boot. The Cecafa win crowned a superb year for Starlets, whose run towards a historic place at next years Tokyo Olympics was halted at the penultimate stage by Zambia. On Sunday, the Kenyans were nominated in the Women National team of the year category of the 2019 CAF Awards. While coach David Ouma was shortlisted in the Women’s coach of the year category of the annual awards, whose ceremony will be held on January 7, 2020, at Citadel Azure, Hurghada, Egypt. In defeating the hosts and holders Tanzania, Ouma made only one change from the team that started in the semi-final with Mercy Airo back from suspension to replace Siliya Lumasia. Airo, Mwanalima Adam and Janet Bundi led the futile hunt for goals until Shikangwa replaced the latter 10 minutes into the second half. Captain, Dorcas Shikobe, alongside  Nelly Sawe, Ruth Ingosi, Vivian Nasaka and goalkeeper  Annette Kundu ensured the Kenyan's finished the tournament without conceding a goal from open play.
