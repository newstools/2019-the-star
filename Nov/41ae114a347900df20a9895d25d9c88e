Two convicted elephant poachers have received reduced sentences â€” fines of Sh220,000 each or 15-month jail terms. The Narok High Court reduced the sentences from a Sh1 millon fine each or five years in jail. Moge Malit and Metian Rakatian appealed after they were convicted of having two elephant tusks weighing two kilogrammes each, with a street value of Sh2 million. They were convicted on January 17, 2018. The offence occurred on January 24, 2016. They were found in possession of trophies at Isuruani area of Narok South subcounty. In reducing the sentences, judge Justus Bwonwong'a said that though the offences were very serious, the two were first-time offenders and had been in court since November 2016. Rakatian had appealed saying the sentence was too harsh and failed to consider that he had been in custody throughout the trial. He said he was an epileptic and is the sole provider for a sick mother and three children. Malit appealed saying he had been in custody throughout the trial, he was remorseful and was the sole provider for his family. (Edited by V. Graham)
