Mandera has partnered with Nairobi's Inspectorate College to train officers in professional operations, observing laws, traffic rules and first aid. CEC Ahmed Sheikh said Nairobi is more advanced and well equipped compared to Mandera and has the experience to assist their officers. Speaking in Mandera town on Thursday when he received five instructors from Nairobi, Sheikh urged his officers to take training seriously. The week-long training stared on Thursday. â€œTraining is important to enhance the capacity of our enforcement officers to execute their mandate in a more efficient, effective and professional manner," CED Sheikh said. The ministry is restructuring the Enforcement and Inspectorate Department in line with the growing needs of the county, he said. The Directorate of Enforcement is mandated with monitoring and ensuring the implementation and compliance of all county laws and regulations. The meeting was also attended by county secretary Abdinur Maalim Hussein and other senior county government officials. During the World First Aid Day on September 12, Mandera's rapid response team won this year's first aid competition in Nairobi. The win was the culmination of the training started in March by the county in partnership with the National Police service. Edited by R.Wamochie
