Farmers in Kenya now have a great opportunity to easily acquire farm machinery and equipment following the signing of a joint scheme between the Co-operative Bank and CFAO Kenya Ltd (formally Toyota Tsusho East Africa Ltd). The new Financing Scheme will enable farmers and co-operative societies to finance the purchase of tractors, combine harvesters and other farm equipment they need in a more affordable fashion. This scheme will offer farmers and co-operative societies up to 80 per cent financing, thereby enabling them to acquire brand new machinery and equipment - such as the popular Case IH Tractors - that they need without having to pay the huge costs upfront. Speaking during the launch of the partnership, Co-op Bank director of Co-operatives Banking, Vincent Marangu said Co-operative Bank is always looking for ways to assist customers to succeed in their projects and businesses. “With this partnership, we will enable farmers and co-operative societies to more easily acquire brand new Agri-machinery and equipment from a trusted and leading brand,” Marangu said. CFAO Kenya managing director, Toyoki Kuno said his company is fully committed to supporting the Big Four Agenda especially food security by providing comprehensive farming solutions which include but not limited to selling tractors.
