Kisii RFC dropped to the bottom of the table after dishing out a walkover against United States International University’s Martials due to lack of funds. The club failed to raise Sh100,000 for the trip. USIU rejected the cash-strapped club’s request to postpone the game and were consequently deducted two points for failing to honour the fixture. And yesterday, Captain George Sagini and Treasurer Steve Mogonchi sent out an SOS. “The team is broke. We failed to honour our game against USIU because we didn’t have money. Hosting a home match, we require about Sh20,000. I’m sending out an appeal to well-wishers to help us play this game,” said Sagini. Mogonchi, who confirmed the resignation of former secretary Joseph Okong’o, said that giving up is not an option and appealed for help. In the club’s first home game against Egerton Wasps, they introduced an entry fee of Sh100. The club’s problems have been compounded by the closure of Kisii University grounds ahead of their graduation ceremony. “As at now, we don’t have a place to train,” added Sagini. At the same time, log leaders Strathmore Leos and second-placed Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST) maintained their perfect start to the season. Leos lead the log with 14 points from three games while MMUST have 13 points. Over the weekend, Leos thumped Catholic Monks 40-10 while MMUST thrashed newbies Eldoret RFC 38-0 in Kakamega. University of Eldoret’s Trojans remained third despite losing 21-15 against Egerton Wasps. It was Egerton’s first win of the season. Former three-time Kenya Cup winners Mean Machine rose to fifth place on the table after a 36-3 win over debutants Northern Suburbs. It was Machine’s first win of the season.
