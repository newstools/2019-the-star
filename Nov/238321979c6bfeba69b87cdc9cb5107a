Former  Sauti Sol personal assistant Said Hussein will compete for the title of Mr Africa International in Lagos, Nigeria. The event will be held from December 3 to 9 and will feature 20 other African contestants. Said has promised to bring the title home as he believes he has the confidence, brains, discipline and stamina to beat the other hunks! Said, who wakes up at 3am to meditate, believes he could be an inspiration to younger generations. He hopes to encourage young people to believe in themselves, especially after he fell victim to  body shaming. “This year has been my lowest. I got a lot of negative comments about my body and my looks, which got into my head at some point and almost made me lose confidence in myself,” he said. He did not let the negativity get to him. "As much as I got discouraged by so many people, I believed in myself and all that it took to prepare for this pageant," Said said. He hopes to help the youth in Malindi beat drug addiction and focus on their studies and dreams instead. Said said he hopes to win and help establish a school in Malindi for special needs children.
