Celebrity mother Diana Marua says she underwent postpartum depression after giving birth to her firstborn, Heaven. "When I got Heaven, that was the worst time of my life. I got post-partum depression. I had a husband and a nanny," she said on her YouTube channel. "The support system is key. My hubby started being busy, he was coming home late and had early mornings. You've done everything and the baby is crying." Marua said her husband Bahati has learnt the ropes and after her second baby, Majesty, he was supportive. "If your woman has given birth, get paternity leave, your wife needs all the support she can get. Be an inspiration to your woman. It's a matter of time before you see your child grow. These little babies have nothing to do with whatever is going on in your life. Speak life to your children."
