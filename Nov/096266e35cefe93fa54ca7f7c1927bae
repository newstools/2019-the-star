Heavily pregnant 'Real Househelp of Kawangware' actress Njambi has opened up about a miscarriage she had with her previous pregnancy. She wrote on social media, "That gave me the anxiety of sharing this news of this pregnancy. When we got pregnant on November 2017, we were not ready. I remember after the miscarriage on April 2018, everyone told us that everything happened for a reason. We didn't quite understand that it wasn't the right time for us. "We both had unsolved issues and a lot of baggage at the time. But Lord knows how hard losing that baby was, we were not only heartbroken but our relationship got broken too. We made stupid decisions last year because we didn't know how to handle the pain together." She says that this time round, she is emotionally, spiritually ready.
