The Orange Democratic Movement will be unveiling its new headquarters on Thursday. The party's new home, Chungwa House, is located inÂ Lavington. It is 300 metres from the ANC party headquarters. The party's former headquarters was in Kilimani, where it had been since 2006. Party communication director Philip Etale said on Monday that the office is fully owned by the party. The Kilimani headquarters was home to ODM until the party had a disagreement with the owner of the property, Caroli Omondi, who was Raila's aide. During the new headquarters launch, the party will also unveil its Digital Membership Registration programme.
