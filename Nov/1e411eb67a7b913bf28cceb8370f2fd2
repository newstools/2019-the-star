Police in Bomet will tomorrow arraign 10 women arrested at Roborwo village in Chepalungu during a crackdown on female genital mutilation. Among those arrested on Friday night are eight girls aged between 21 and 24 years who had already undergone the cut, a circumciser and a caregiver. Chepalungu subcounty police commander Nelson Maasai said the suspects are being held at Chebunyo police station. Maasai said the eight girls are set to be taken to the Longisa hospital today (Monday) for examination before being arraigned. He said officers acted on a tip from members of the public. There is a heightened crackdown on the practice by his officers and area administrators. "This is an area where the outlawed FGM is widely being practised. We had to be alert to ensure the perpetrators are arrested and charged. Residents have also been cooperative on reporting this," Maasai said. The circumciser and the caregiver, he said, will face charges of abetting and aiding FGM. The arrest of the 10 comes in the wake of another arrest of 15 women at Kapsegon village in the same area last week. The Bomet administration plans to join the world in marking 16 days of activism against gender-based violence which kicks off today (Monday). Gender and Social Services director Rose Chepkorir said they have planned mentorship programmes for young girls across the five subcounties. At least 1,500 schoolgoing girls are targeted. Bomet county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding said it was regrettable that some residents were still trying to practice outlawed cultural activities. Stern action will be taken against the crusaders, he said.
