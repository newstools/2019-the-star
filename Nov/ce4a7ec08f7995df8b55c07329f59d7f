Naivasha Prison finally has water after a three-week stalemate that pitted it against Naivasha Water, Sanitation and Sewerage Company. The firm had disconnected supply over Sh7 million debt. Two weeks ago, its staff clashed with prison warders after they tried to block a sewer system. Yesterday, water officials met with the prison's management, which agreed to clear the debt before yearend. Supply was immediately restored. A prison officer said the water crisis had ruined their operations and sanitation, and there were fears of a disease outbreak. "Water is very critical in this prison, which has over 3,000 inmates. We are happy that its flow has been restored. We were facing a health crisis,” he said. Company MD Nahashon Wahome said the huge debts owed by state institutions in Naivasha town had hurt their services. "We've restored water services to Naivasha Prison and the staff quarters following an agreement with the management and we hope that this will be respected," he said. Also cited was KWS Training Institute, which the firm said owes them a sum dating back to 2016. “We have launched a campaign in and around Naivasha to collect dues owed to us and, this way, we shall definitely improve our services," Wahome said. Meanwhile, several estates in Naivasha have been hit by an acute water shortage after pipes were cut off by a road contractor. The water firm has threatened to sue the contractor so he is compelled to pay damages and reinstall the pipes. Wahome said they have lost Sh1 million pipes to the ongoing road works. The worst-hit areas are County Council, Site and Kabati. Residents now have to dig deep into their pockets to buy water from vendors. Wahome admitted that the shortage was serious and sought to assure residents that they were doing all they could to restore supply.
