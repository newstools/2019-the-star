Over 20 people were injured, six of them seriously, following a road accident involving 10 cars along the Maai Mahiu-Limuru road. The midday incident occurred after a lorry heading to Naivasha from Nairobi lost control and rammed into the cars a few kilometers from Maai Mahiu town. Following the accident, the road was completely blocked off leading to a massive traffic snarl-up that stretched for over 2km from the scene. During the incident, area residents looted tens of flour bales and mattresses from some of the vehicles involved in the accident. Police had a hard time controlling the surging crowd at the scene. The situation was worsened by downpour pounding the area at the time. Matatu driver John Mwangi said the accident occurred so fast, with the speeding lorry crushing into cars, a matatu and a trailer. He said due to the narrow road, it was impossible for the affected drivers to avoid the crash. “The trailer came downhill hitting one car after the other before crashing by the roadside and in the process scores of people were injured,” he said. Passenger Jane Wamuyu who was heading to Nairobi from Narok  said they miraculously escaped death after the trailer hit the side of their vehicle. “We knew something was wrong when we started hearing loud bangs but we could not escape from the car but we are glad that we are all safe,” she said.
