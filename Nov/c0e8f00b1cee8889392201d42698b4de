The 4th edition of the Lake International PanAfrican Film festival is being held in Nakuru county for the second time from yesterday to Friday. The annual festival aims to bring filmmakers together and open up the region to reap the benefits of tourism, intellectual and cultural exchange, while increasing the African cinematic experience by taking African language films to the people. This year's edition of the festival has opened up for youth and experts to submit films in any African languages with English subtitles made in Africa. The Gala Awards will take place on Saturday evening in an invite-only red carpet event at The Alps Hotel in Nakuru.
