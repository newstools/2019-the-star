Sarova Panafric hotel, Nairobi, hosted its signature cake-mixing session on November 15 to usher in the festive season. The event was hosted by chef Avraj Marwa of Sarova Panafric. The event was graced by students from BOMA, IHTI, Utalii and Strathmore, among others guests. The guests, excited to mix the contents that will go into the 100kg Christmas cake for the year, got to work creating an aromatic melange from the various ingredients laid out. The history of cake mixing dates back to the 17th century as the harvest season arrived. During this period a lot of fruits and nuts were harvested and prepared to make traditional plum cake.
