A KCSE candidate died on Friday after undergoing a successful Caesarian delivery. Catherine Iminza, 19, of Lwanda Lugari Secondary School, was admitted at the Lumakanda subcounty hospital on Thursday afternoon in labour pains as she prepared to sit her Kiswahili paper. She missed the exam. Doctors recommended delivery by Caesarian section after prolonged labour. She delivered a baby boy. She was retained in hospital where all arrangements were made for her to sit her Chemistry practical paper on Friday. But she could not as she writhed in pain the whole day. “Her condition deteriorated on Friday evening and she passed on leaving behind the baby who is still at the hospital,” said Lugari deputy county commissioner William Lenaremo. Lenaremo said the medical report indicated that the teenager developed high blood pressure complications and died as the medical officers were preparing to transfer her to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital for specialized medical attention. Last Monday, another candidate at St Augustine Milimani Secondary School in the same subcounty sat her first paper at the Mautuma subcounty hospital after giving birth, hours prior to the official exam start time. She was admitted to hospital with labour pains on Sunday by her parents. Lenaremo said quick arrangements were made for her to sit her paper in hospital after the centre manager learnt she was missing from school.
