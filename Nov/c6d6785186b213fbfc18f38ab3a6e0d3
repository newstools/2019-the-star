The third edition of Tsavo Run is targeting 2,000 participants ahead of the event set for December 7 inside the vast Tsavo National Reserves. This will be more than three times the number of participants who ran in the 2018 edition (600 runners). Runners will cover an epic 84km relay run that will take runners through a scenic course in the wild. The relay will comprise 14 runners who will cover 6km each and a team manager. Each team will have to part with Sh250,000 for registration—translating to Sh15,000 for every individual. Participants can also register as individuals at a fee of  (Sh15,000) and will be grouped up with others to form a team. Tsavo Heritage Foundation (THF) chairman, Jacob Mwaluda noted that conservation is a very important subject and can be liven up through. THF has partnered with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and Sarova Groups of Hotels for the event. “Sports is one of the things that make conservation talks and activities interesting. 84km may look insurmountable for a human being especially amateur runners but 14 can manage it well. This is a symbol that although Tsavo rehabilitation is a big problem, It can be solved if we all come together and play our small parts,” said Mwaluda. He added: “There is a very scenic route and the only course where you will run and have elephants clapping you on. Sports is the easiest tool to use in mobilising communities to play an active role in conservation.” The registration is ongoing at tsavorun.org and will close on December 5. The 600 runners last year were drawn from 10 corporate companies, three colleges (150 ) from the Tsavo Conservation block which consists of 12 counties. The Tsavo Run will be preceded by a two-day conservation conference which will bring together the government, counties and stakeholders from the environment, water and wildlife sectors.
