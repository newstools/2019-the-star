Marriane Kitany's uncle and former senior police officer John Kibii has narrated how he tried in vain to mediate and save her marriage to Meru Senator Mithika Linturi. Kibii, who describes former aide in Deputy President William Ruto's office Kitany as being like his daughter, said he thought the couple's differences could be sorted out. The 87-year-old man said he first met Linturi in 2015, when he visited Kitany's home in Kileleshwa. "We took breakfast together and later he left me as he was going to Parliament for a meeting," Kibii said. The uncle said he visited Marriane in her Runda home last year after her mother told him Linturi had deserted their house. Kibii recounted finding Linturi's parents at the house, though the senator was not around. He spent the night at the home and held a reconciliation meeting the following day when Linturi came. Kibii said he though the issue was a domestic dispute, but later found out the dispute revolved around property and company ownership. Linturi did not speak much and both he and Kitany refused to have minutes recorded. The meeting ended without any tangible solution. Kibii said Marriane claimed that she spent her money putting up the house in Runda and in Meru and that the title deeds had been taken by Linturi. Kibii said Linturi declined to talk about the matter and they proceeded to have lunch. Linturi left but his parents remained. "I later learnt through the media that the matter had taken a new turn and was in court," Kibii said. The former police officer said he had no issues with Linturi as he is Kitany's husband.
