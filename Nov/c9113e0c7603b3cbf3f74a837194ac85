The 1984 world rally champion, Stig Blomqvist, will lead ‘Team Tidö’ in the East African Safari Rally from November 26 to December 6. Blomqvist and his partners will be attempting to win the event for the second time. Team Tido’s other goal will be to bring 5,000 pairs of pre-owned spectacles, three Swedish optometrists and two local opticians to the communities along the rally route. Their aim will be to test eyes and distribute eyewear while ensuring that as many people as possible enjoy the possibility to see clearly. The 2019 East African Safari Classic Rally marks the fourth Race4Health mission across East Africa as its reach continues to spread. “If you can see, you can learn to read, if you can read, you can go to school,” says David von Schinkel, team principal at Team Tidö Race4Health. “This is a way to help provide the baseline for education and independence in rural areas, where most people might not otherwise experience this opportunity,” he added. The legendary Blomqvist is a former works driver with Saab, Ford, Peugeot, Nissan and Skodahe is best remembered as one of the original pilots of the all-conquering Audi Quattros. He became world rally champion with Audi in 1984. He was also the winner of the 2015 Safari Classic Rally and remains a firm favourite with all Safari Rally fans. Stig’s co-driver, Jörgen Fornander, who previously partnered Joakim Roman in 2013 and 2015, will be taking part in his third Safari. He had the best finish of position 17 overall. The rally, sponsored by Safaricom, has attracted 21 cars. Other sponsors include M-PESA (Safaricom PLC), Vivo Energy, MFI , Omologato and DT Dobie.
