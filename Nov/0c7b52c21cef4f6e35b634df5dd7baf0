IEBC has warned Kibra voters against violating secrecy of the ballot by sharing photos of marked ballot papers. Via a post on Twitter, Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission said it is punishable in law. This was after a Kibra resident took a picture of marked papers and posted them on Twitter on Thursday. Voters trooped to the polls in a contest considered a dress rehearsal for the 2022 General Election and a test of muscle for both DP William Ruto and ODM party leader Raila Odinga. The winner succeeds MP Ken Okoth who died in July, triggering the hotly contested by-election. ODM's Bernard Okoth, Ken's brother, faces Jubilee's McDonald Mariga, an ex-football star and Eliud Owalo of ANC. Twenty-four candidates are on the ballot. The Elections Offences Act requires every officer, candidate or agent in attendance at a polling station to maintain and aid in maintaining the secrecy of the ballot. A person who contravenes these provisions on secrecy commits an offence and  is  liable  on  conviction,  to  a  fine  not  exceeding  one  million  shillings  or  to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or to both.
