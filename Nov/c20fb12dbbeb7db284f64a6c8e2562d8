The crisis at the Alupe Subcounty Hospital in Teso South continues to worsen. Essential services have been disrupted following the strike by clinical officers that has entered the fifth day. Their talks with the government on the collective bargaining agreement and payment of diploma interns collapsed. On Tuesday, there were no admissions in hospitals. The inpatient section was deserted. Beds were empty. Alupe is the second referral hospital in Busia county and serves Teso South. It also allows referrals from six subcounties. Joseph Akisa regretted that the outpatient department was deserted and he opted to seek services from a private hospital over seven kilometres from the facility. "It is very expensive but we have no option other than seeking treatment from our beloved who was involved in an accident," Akisa said. Patients were stranded at the reception, with no one to attend to them.Â Some of those who had been waiting for services at the outpatient section opted for private facilities. Those who were cash-strapped sought the help of traditional doctors. Clinical officers are in charge of 90 per cent of Kenya's outpatient department and have trained in offering essential services.
