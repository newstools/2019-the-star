A number of clubs for the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) national league playoffs scheduled forÂ  November 22-24 claim to have been turned away at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The clubs are on record as saying the venue is fully booked November 21 hence forcing them to train elsewhere. Six of the eight sides set to feature in the playoffs had hoped to get a feel of the gymnasium ahead of the competition but their plans were scuttled. However, on the contrary, Sports Kenya Director General Pius Metto said he has no letter from any club regarding any bookings or request for the Arena. "I have no requests on my table from any volleyball club or any bookings. I urge them to register their requests and concerns with my office," offered Metto who also registered that the New Annex gymnasium is ready for use. Women champions Kenya Prisons, former winners Kenya Pipeline and playoffs newcomers DCI have been forced to seek alternative indoor facilities after allegedly being turned away. The 2018 runners up Kenya Commercial Bank, on the other hand, have had to settle for a facility at Barclays Sports Club in Ruaraka. In the men's category, holders General Service Unit and former champions Kenya Prisons are allegedly in the same dilemma. KPA and Kenya Defence Forces' Ulinzi are using their institutional-owned gymnasia- Makande Hall and Moi Air Base Arena respectively.
