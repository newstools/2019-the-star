Former world cross country champion Agnes Jebet Tirop and reigning Africa cross country junior champion Nicholas Kimeli will defend their Ziwa Farmers 10km road race tomorrow in Uasin Gishu County. Tirop, who last Sunday won the inaugural Tuskys 10km Great Run in Eldoret,  said she is well prepared for the event that will be held in Ziwa, along the newly refurbished Eldoret-Cherangany road. The 2019 world 10,000m bronze medallist said her preparations have hit the climax following a good performance last Sunday. “Winning the Tuskys title last Sunday was a precursor for Saturday's race as I plan to defend my title. As a defending champion, it will not be easy because many athletes will be yearning for the title,” said Tirop. Tirop will be chasing a hat-trick after winning the title in 2017 and 2018. She won a brace in 31:30.90 ahead of Dorcas Kipchirchir (31:30.55), the 2017 Standard Chartered marathon winner and former Barcelona Marathon champion Valary Aiyabei Jemeli ( 31:42.08) who placed third. Former Commonwealth Games 10,000m silver medallist Stacy Ndiwa was fourth. “Winning the title for the third time will be my greatest joy. I want to leave a mark in the race,” said Tirop who trains under Gianni Demadonna in Iten. Fresh from representing the country at the World Championships in Doha, Qatar, Kimeli will be chasing a brace in the race that enters its 5th year running. “I have been training for the same and I hope to defend my title," he said. Kimeli finished second at Tuskys 10km Great Run last Sunday behind World Under-20 10,000m champion Rhonex Kipruto. Last year, Kimeli clocked 28:20.4 to win Ziwa Farmers 10km race last year title ahead of Titus Kipruto (28:23.4) and Albert Kangogo (28:32.3).
