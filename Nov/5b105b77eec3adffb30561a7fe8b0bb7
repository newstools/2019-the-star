​The family of Eric Oloo on Monday alleged foul play in their quest for justice after a prime suspect in the murder of the Star journalist was not arraigned on Monday. Oloo was found murdered on Thursday morning in the house of Ugunja deputy OCS Sabina Kerubo. Kerubo, her daughter and house help were arrested alongside a fourth suspect Frankline Luta who is said to have been in the house at the time Oloo was killed. A fifth suspect, Victor Luta, Frankline's brother was arrested on Saturday. On Monday, only Victor and Frankline were arraigned before Siaya principal magistrate James Ong'ondo. Oloo's family is now reading a planned cover-up to shield the police inspector from facing murder charges. Oloo’s mother Kezia Oloo said they did not want to speculate but that it was not clear why Sabina was not presented to court after being arrested n Thursday. The law requires that a suspect is arraigned within 24 hours after arrest. “How do we put it when the prime suspect Chief Inspector Sabina Kerubo, her house help and the daughter who were arrested alongside Victor and Franklin are not presented before the court to tell us what they know about my son’s death,” Kezia said. Sources intimated police were considering making Kerubo, the daughter and the house help become state witnesses. Siaya county commissioner Micheal Ole Tialal said Kerubo together with the other two suspects will be arraigned on Tuesday. He, however, did not explain why the officer was not presented in court on Monday, only saying the suspects were being processed for arraignment. Both Victor and Frankline did not take a plea. Investigating officer Joseph Kinuthia requested they be given 14 more days to complete investigations into the murder. The suspects however protested the request, saying two weeks was a long time to stay in custody. The magistrate gave the DCI  11 days to conclude the investigations. He directed that the suspects be brought before court on December 10.  edited by p. obuya
