A Nairobi court has given police orders to investigate a woman suspected to be linked to the death of an AP officer who reportedly shot himself in the head. Jonah Kimani, an AP officer attached at Tena AP post, allegedly shot himself after leaving a note claiming he died because of a woman. In an affidavit filed in court, investigating officer attached at DCI Buruburu Godwins Ogola says Kimani was alleged to have committed suicide on May 26 inside his house within police quarters at Umoja 2. “He went to the armoury at around 6.30pm where he picked an AK47 rifle loaded with 30 rounds of ammunition and after about one hour, a gunshot was heard coming from his house within the police line,” Ogola told the court. He said the officers who were around then rushed to Kimani’s house and upon looking through the window, they saw the body lying on his bed. Crime scene officers from Buruburu police station including DCI officers were sought and the house was broken into. Ogola said inside the house, the officers found a suicide note and a rifle. “On the suicide note, he gave a name of one Juliet (Lilian Kakwai) and her mobile number saying she was the cause of his death,” the affidavit reads. The court heard that the said Juliet has since refused to record her statement with the investigating officer and her mobile phone appears to have been switched off upon learning about the officer's death. She has relocated to unknown place. The investigating officer was seeking to have orders directing Safaricom to supply him with certified copies of account-registration documents of Juliet’s mobile number. He also sought copies of outgoing and incoming call data from May 1 to date. The officers wanted rent receipts from KV Kayole agent of tenants from January 1 to date. Chief magistrate Heston Nyaga granted the orders. Edited by R.Wamochie
