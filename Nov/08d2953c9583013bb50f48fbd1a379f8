Kilifi county assembly Speaker Jimmy Kahindi has declared Dabaso ward seat vacant. The declaration on Monday comes after the High Court in Malindi nullified the election of Emmanuel Changawa after a petition by ANC candidate Dickson Karani. This means another by-election is scheduled to take place in Kilifi after the October 17 Ganda ward by-election. Karani moved to court to challenge ODM's victory citing mass irregularities in the exercise. The decision gives ODM another political test barely one week after the Kibra by-election and less than one month after Ganda's in Malindi. Kahindi, while making the declaration at a sitting in the assembly, said the MCA will cease to get all privileges. "Changawa ceases to be an MCA and all privileges that were accorded to him are withdrawn," he said. Speaking to journalists after the announcement, Changawa urged his electorates to be patient and wait for the official date of the by-election to be announced by the electoral agency. He also told the ODM party to give him a direct ticket as he has been loyal throughout. "As you know, I was having a petition for a long time and now we are going back to the elections. It's not something new and I was aware of it," he said. The IEBC now has 90 days to make an official announcement on the date of the by-election which will bring back another season of the campaign in the county. On October 17, ODM won the Ganda seat in a battle between Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa's independent candidate Abdulrahman Omar whose win was challenged and ODM's Rueben Katana. One person died during the campaigns after the Malindi MP stormed a meeting at Katana's home in Pendukiani leading to a shootout. In Kibra, ODM won the seat in a battle which was seen to be between party leader Raila Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto. Edited by R.Wamochie
