Bungoma county next year will register beneficiaries aged 60 and above of the National Hospital Insurance Fund. Speaking while introducing board members of various hospitals at Mabanga FTC on Wednesday, Deputy Governor Charles Ngome said the majority of older people are sick and poor. Their efforts to access proper treatment and medication have always hit a snag, he said. ”We have agreed with our Governor Wycliffe Wangamati that the plan to register people to benefit from county free NHIF cover will start in January to enable them to access free medication in our facilities whenever they fall sick,” Ngome said. Wangamati had pledged to register all households to benefit from free NHIF cover but later said it only cover people aged 60 and above. Ngome asked the board members to create a strong working relationship with medics and nurses to improve the working environment for better services. Boards were introduced for Bungoma County Referral Hospital, Webuye County Hospital, Bumula, Chwele, Cheptais, Kimilili, Naitiri and Mt Elgon subcounty hospitals. "The majority of hospitals have been lacking board members for three to four years but the new team will manage the facilities better, " Chief Health officer Patrick Wandili said. He said hospital boards are key decision-making organs and urged members to "act with decorum." Edited by R.Wamochie
