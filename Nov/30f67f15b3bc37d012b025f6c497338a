Long-serving Star columnist Chris Harrison has just published an anthology of his best writing from the last 10 years. The book, titled 'Marketing Medicine', targets businesspeople who would like to understand the process of marketing, from CEOs who employ marketers to entrepreneurs and students. Harrison says this is “probably the first business book to be authored in Kenya, and certainly the first on marketing”. The book is available locally from Bookstop, Yaya Centre, and Text Book Centre Sarit and Junction. Both printed and Kindle versions of the book are also available from www.amazon.com. Recently, business leaders gathered in Karen for the first in a series of book-signing events.
