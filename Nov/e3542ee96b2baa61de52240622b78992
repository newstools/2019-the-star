Sol Generation singer Nviiri the Storyteller was in Tanzania for a media tour and praised beauty queen Wema Sepetu. “Ametambua mziki na pia mimi nimemtambua. Big shout-out, I appreciate that she shared the music and that means a lot. I thought, should I get into her DM and leave my number?” The singer said he is “very single”. “It depends on who is asking but I’m not in a relationship,” he said. Nviiri is currently making headlines with the song Pombe Sigara and Overdose.
