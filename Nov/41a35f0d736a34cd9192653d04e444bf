A Nairobi court has dismissed an application by private detective Jane Mugo where she sought State protection. "Mugo in her application did not state or explain to the court how she wanted to be protected," presiding magistrate Martha Mutuku said on Tuesday. Last month,the DPP urged the court to detain Mugo at Lang'ata women’s prison to ensure her safety as she claimed her life is in danger. The submission came following an application by the private investigator seeking state protection after receiving threats on her life. “The court can order that she be remanded at Lang’ata women’s prison where her security will be assured,” the prosecution said. Through her lawyers Danstan Omari and former Kiambu senior principal magistrate Brian Khaemba, Mugo said that it was only by God’s mercy that she was alive. “Her clients have been given state protection …at the moment she has no gun with her. It is with the Firearms Licensing Board,” Omari said. Earlier last month, Mugo informed the court through an affidavit that her life was threatened by investigating officers in the case in which she is accused of threatened to kill two people. "Our client’s life is in danger as she is afraid of the investigators in the case by the way they are treating her. We urge the court's protection as we intend to reveal the context of the threats," the defence said. In the affidavit, Mugo claimed that threats to her life and her family began way back in 2014 but despite her reporting to the police, none of the cases was dealt with.
