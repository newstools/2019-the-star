The Kenyatta University bus that slid off a ferry ramp into the shallow waters of Indian ocean had no passengers, Kenya Ferry services have confirmed. In a statement on Tuesday, they said all passengers had alighted before boarding the ferry. The driver of the bus failed to negotiate uphill momentum as it disembarked from the ferry at the mainland ramp. "Our attention has been drawn to the video clip circulating in the social media platform yesterday depicting a Kenyatta university bus whose driver failed to maintain a safe speed to ascend up uphill as te bus disembarked from the ferry at the mainland ramp," read the statement. The bus driver was however assisted by ferry staff and managed to proceed on successfully. Their sentiments came a day after a video did rounds on social media of the Kenyatta university bus encounteringÂ difficulties while climbing the steep ramp immediately after it had stepped out of the ferry. The ramp was also said to be slippery due to the heavy rains in the coast region.
