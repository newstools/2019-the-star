The Interior ministry is set to auction 75 vehicles for between Sh18,000 and Sh620,000. A GKA 250c Land Rover 110 TDI is being sold for Sh18,000, while a GKL 506 Flat IVECO lorry will be sold for Sh620,000. In an advert on Tuesday, the ministry said the document containing detailed information may be obtained from procurement office room 153 from 8am to 5pm from November 5. This should be done upon payment ofÂ  a nonrefundable fee of Sh500. "Payment shall be made in cash at the Administration Police service at Jogoo house," the advert read. All interested bidders may view the vehicles at the respective stations from November 5 to November 20 during working hours. "They will verify details for themselves as the vehicles are neither warranted by the ministry nor the appointed auctioneer," it read. All bidders are required to pay a refundable deposit of Sh10,000 for motor vehicles. Bidders are also required to obtain bidding numbers after payment of a deposit which will also be used as an entry pass to the auction yard. Successful bidders must pay a deposit of 25 per cent of the purchase price by the close of the auction date and the remaining 75 per cent within seven days, failing which the item will be disposed of. Items purchased will be collected from the GSU headquarters within 14 days after full payment. Successful bidders will also be required to pay all costs applicable, duties and taxes associated with items bought. The ministry will not accept any price below the reserved price
