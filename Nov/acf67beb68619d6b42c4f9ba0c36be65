Six people were on Friday evening lynched by an irate mob in Busia county. The identities of the six were not known in the locality. The six were said to have been hired by a businesswoman to escort her to remove the body of a businessman who had been kidnapped two weeks ago and later found dead in Marachi location. "Villagers became suspicious when they spotted six clad in black suits. They noticed one of them had a bag and demanded to search it and upon the search, discovered three knives," said Western Regional Police Commander Edward Mwamburi. "The villagers suspected that the six could have been linked to the death of the businessman and descended on them killing them." The businessman John Aduor had been kidnapped in his home in Masebula village by three people, one of them armed with a gun and was found dead in Kagonya sublimation in Ugenya subcounty in Siaya. The incident occurred at Wamasela Primary School where the deceased's body had been taken for viewing on Friday evening. The body was due for burial on Saturday in West Marachi ward. The six were said to be known bouncers traditionally engaged by politicians in Ugenya sub-county. "We are dealing with this situation. We're investigating the matter and anyone who will be found to have played a role in the death of the six will face the law," Mwamburi said. "We appeal to the public not to take law in their hands but report the matter to police for action."
