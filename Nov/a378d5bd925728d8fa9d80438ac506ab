Sky News now says it does not have conclusive evidence that the stowaway who dropped in a London garden was a cleaner with Colnet cleaning services at JKIA. Sky News had published a story with photos as well as a video last week on the stowaway who fell from a Kenya Airways plane as it prepared to land at Heathrow Airport in June. The report, from Africa correspondent John Sparks, identified the stowaway as  Paul Manyasi and he was alleged to work for Colnet. The story was based on corroborating interviews with people who identified as friends, relatives and colleagues of Paul Manyasi - including Isaac Manyasi, who was thought to be the stowaway's father. However, in an interview with KTN on Wednesday last week, Isaac distanced himself from the stowaway and said his son is called Cedric Isaac Shivonje and is in remand. Sky News on Thursday said, "Sky News regrets that our reporting was founded on misleading information." Colnet on November 13 denied claims that the alleged stowaway who died in London was one of their staff. The cleaning company said all its employees have been investigated and none in the company  goes by the name Paul Manyasi whose frozen body dropped off from a KQ plane into a garden in an affluent Southern London suburb on June 30 this year.
