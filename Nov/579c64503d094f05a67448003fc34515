Defending Premier League champions Butali Warriors hope to keep their run as they take on Wazalendo today at the City Park Stadium. Butali are eyeing their fourth title and remain unbeaten in 15 matches. The league leaders have garnered 39 points with only three draws denying them a possible 45 points. Wazalendo are second and boast a talented pool of players—coming through their academy. They have won 10 times, drawn thrice and lost as many games to claim 33 points. The two sides drew 1-1 in the first leg but they both won their last matches. Today's encounter promises thrills as the two sides are currently enjoying top form. Butali coach Denis Owoka has acknowledged the good work put in by Wazalendo's coaching staff but said his charges will be out for a win. " Today's match is no doubt a title decider with plenty of skill and talent at play. We will have to press them and use our quality to deliver the finishing touch," he said. A draw for Butali will be enough to seal the title. Elsewhere, Police will look to complete a season double over Parklands  and Greensharks.  The law enforcers humiliated Ben Owaga's Greensharks 5-2 and edged Parklands 3-2  in the first leg. Parklands take on Sailors tomorrow. Meanwhile, Kenyatta University Titans are likely to receive the baptism of fire when they face women defending champions Blazers. The Titans suffered an embarrassing 7-0 defeat in the first leg. A win for Blazers will see them crowned champions for a record 22nd time. Sliders will look to atone their 3-0 defeat in the first meeting when they come up against Strathmore University Scorpions. Strathmore are third with 18 points while Sliders have 12 points and rank sixth. Tomorrow, Sliders entertain JKUAT. The students are certain to drop to the Super League after finding the going tough in the top tier.
