The DPP will call 10 witnesses against seven suspects accused of attempting to defraud Sameer Africa boss Naushad Merali of Sh10 million after mimicking President Uhuru Kenyatta's voice. Appearing before chief magistrate Francis Andayi for the pre-trial conference, the defence confirmed they have been supplied with all witness statements and documentary exhibits. "The prosecution will now avail an inventory that will guide on how the proceedings will be conducted then the trial will take place from April 15 to 23, 2020," magistrate Andayi directed. Joseph Waswa, Duncan Muchai, Isaac Wajekeche, William Simiyu, David Luganya, Gilbert Kirunja and Anthony Wafula were charged in February for pretending they were in a position to sell land in Milimani to Sameer Africa between January 24 and February 1 at Prime Bank in Riverside Drive in Nairobi. After the telephone call, Merali instructed his finance director to get in touch with the callers who provided an Equity Bank account number where the money was deposited. Sameer Africa wrote a letter to State House seeking an audience with Uhuru on the land deal. After receiving the letter, State House officials contacted Sameer officials and inquired about the deal between them and the ‘fake President Kenyatta’. The matter was reported to the police upon which officers from the DCI headquarters opened investigations. They were arrested on February 22, after the scheme went wrong and information reached the President and other State House officials. They denied the charges and were each released on a Sh100,000 bail. Kirunja, an IT guru, is believed to be so skilled that he can perfectly mimic the President.
