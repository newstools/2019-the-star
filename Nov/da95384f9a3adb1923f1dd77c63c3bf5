The landslide in West Pokot county that has so far claimed more than 50 lives and several others are still missing. To worsen the situation, the Building Bridges Initiative is being given priority. Leaders are divided over the report and whether it will recommend creating more positions in government. If this is more important than saving the lives of Kenyans not fortunate enough to live in safe places, then the people we chose have misplaced priorities. The entire West Pokot is in mourning, some families have no food, shelter and clothing. Others are still missing while the government plans to provide transport to some people from other parts of the country to the Bomas of Kenya to witness the public launch of the BBI, which involves singing and dancing. On Monday, those charged with the humanitarian issues including Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and his team suspended their tour of affected areas of West Pokot on flimsy excuses of bad weather, yet Deputy President William Ruto among others toured the county the same day to console the families. This really leaves a lot to be desired. The unveiling of the BBI report is the beginning of the end of the Big Four agenda. This is because state officials meant to implement the Big Four agenda are the same ones now championing matters pertaining to BBI. What is now clear is that campaigns for or against the implementation of the report will start across the country. This means that 2022 campaigns will start, leaving no room for development agenda as leaders fight to secure themselves positions in the next government. The government should put citizens’ safety first because their lives are more important than how many elective seats a certain region gets.  Kericho
