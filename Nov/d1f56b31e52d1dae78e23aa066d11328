Wazalendo face National Under-21 side today at the City Park in a build-up encounter as they seek to enhance their fitness and intensity levels ahead of the remaining three league matches. The Premier League outfit drew  1-1  with Greensharks on Wednesday and trail defending champions and leaders Butali by six points. The result dented their title hopes as the league seems to be Butali's to lose. Despite a successful season, coach  Fidelis Kimanzi acknowledged the team looked disjointed for the better part of the game and promised to address their defensive inadequacies and offensive struggles. Wazalendo are second on the log with 30 points from 15 matches. Third-placed Sharks have 24 points—two more than Police who are fourth. Butalii top the table with 36 points. After springing to life in the last quarter and creating numerous chances, Wazalendo could not score the all-important winner. Kamanzi attested that the result was due to irregular training regime and low fitness levels. Wazalendo have been out of action for the last month having last played on October 5 in a 3-0 drubbing of Western Jaguars. He, however, expects an immediate response from his charges. He said: "We didn't play well and we were a bit lazy. We haven't been at our best because we have not played for a month. We settled late into the game but wasted our opportunities. Currently, we are not training together because our venue, Highway Secondary School is an examination centre." "This is a good build-up for us as we look forward to the new season. Winning the title would have been a bonus but all the same, I am happy with how the players have developed. That is how we measure our achievement," he added. Wazalendo play bottom side Parklands on Sunday before taking on defending champions Butali (November 16) and former champions (December 1). Ben Owaga's Greensharks prepare for Sikh, Police and Butali encounters.
