Ibrahim Taraiya, the supermarkert supervisor captured assaulting a female cashier, will be detained for 10 days. This is after the  Office of the Director of Public Prosecution on Monday opposed his bail application on grounds that he will interfere with the investigation. Taraiya, a supervisor at Eastmatt supermarket in Kajiado county, was captured physically assaulting the cashier named Sara Atieno. He was on Monday presented before a Kajiado court where he pleaded not guilty to assault charges. In the video that went viral on social media, Taraiya was seen pulling the cashier  before slapping her several times. It is not yet clear what caused the fracas but police say investigations are in progress. Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji ordered for the arrest of Taraiya following public outrage. Taraiya was arrested on Saturday by DCI detectives before he was presented in court on Monday. The prosecution led by Solomon Njeru told the court that Taraiya has been threatening the woman. He said Taraiya is a flight risk and has been plotting to cross over to Tanzania to escape prosecution. The case will be mentioned on December 6 and bail terms reviewed. Eastmatt Supermarket in a press release on Sunday condemned the act saying the suspect has been suspended. "The cashier has been getting the appropriate medical attention and we assure the public of our commitment towards a cohesive and conducive environment for all our staff members," read part of the release.
