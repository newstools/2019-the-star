Former Kakamega Senator Boni Kahalwale has explained why he had to carry stones during the just concluded Kibra by-election. Khalwale was caught on camera defending himself with stones as he faced rowdy youths during the voting exercise. The former senator who was in the constituency to ‘guard’ Jubilee's McDonald Mariga’s votes also hurled stones at rivals when they confronted him at the DC grounds. "I waited for them, then about 30 youths came carrying stones. I was confident and I wanted to face them like a man and a bullfighter from Ikolomani," Khalwale said. Speaking in Kakamega on Sunday, Khalwale blamed Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and the police IG Hillary Mutyambai for his misgivings. "I call on Matiang'i, police boss and Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho, they must stop playing with security of Kenyans," he said. "Why is it that when these goons were causing chaos nobody took action? I was left to fight for my life as police officers watched." Khalwale disclosed he was left with no option other than to defend himself against the youths who had turned violent and were baying for his blood. "Mimi nikasikia hayo kupitia kwa mtandao kwamba ndio hao wanakuja..wakati walinikaribia, nataka musikie, nobody is going to force a Luhyia to vote for him." he said. Khalwale was on the front line campaigning for Jubilee candidate McDonald Mariga. Mariga lost to ODM's Imran Okoth. Voters trooped to the polls in a contest considered a dress rehearsal for the 2022 General Election and a test of muscle for both DP William Ruto and ODM party leader Raila Odinga Imran will succeed his brother Ken Okoth who died in July, triggering the hotly contested by-election.
