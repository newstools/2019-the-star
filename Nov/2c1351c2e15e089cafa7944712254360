Wrangles in Nairobi County pitting Governor Mike Sonko, speaker Beatrice Elachi and MCAs seem to be getting messy and noisy by the day. Early this week, residents of a ward whose MCA has been at the centre of the infighting in the county, woke up to a sad state of affairs. Human waste and all manner of garbage were littered all over the place. Nearly all roads, walkways and markets in the ward were tuned into a dumpsite. Those in know intimated to Corridors that the ward rep was paying the price for refusing to 'toe the line.' Just what crosses politicians’ minds when they promise the youth government jobs and maybe tenders? This is what youths from one of the major towns in the country told Corridors after a tender some of them were eyeing was handed to a senior politician, known for rallying the young people on the auspices of hope of a brighter future. The lot said they are left wondering whether their dream to work for government would come true. Their argument is that the tender for the town upgrade could have best been executed by their companies as it would not have beaten their capacity. Some of them now say they will no longer accept the ‘leaders of tomorrow tag’ when the elites come calling for votes. A former lawmaker turned peace ambassador, left his friends in stitches after he cried foul over a contractor he paid for the task of recording his works. The prominent politician says he paid the said individual Sh1.5 million but the fellow only handed him a single piece of the product they were piecing up. His argument is that the technocrat showed him a carton full of the goods after which he paid up. The friends were overheard whispering that the old man seems ignorant of how the contract he entered into is handled.
