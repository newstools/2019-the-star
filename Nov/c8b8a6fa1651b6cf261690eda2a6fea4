A 20-year-old female candidate at Nyawita Secondary School in Rangwe constituency has died after a long battle with sickle cell anaemia. Belinda Atieno died on Tuesday night shortly after arriving at Matata Hospital in Oyugis town where she was taken for specialised medical treatment. According to the school principal George Olueya, the student succumbed after  living with the anaemic condition for long. Olueya said Ateino's condition worsened at the beginning of third term, which prompted her to be on and off school. Speaking on Wednesday, the school principal said the girl sat her Tuesday papers at a nearby health facility where she was taken after she complained of tiredness. “She sat all previous KCSE papers in the school except the Tuesday papers which she did at Nyawita dispensary where she was rushed after her condition deteriorated,” Olueya said. The school head said they later took the candidate to Asumbi Mission Hospital before transferring her to Matata for specialised treatment. “It’s unfortunate she was pronounced dead in the night shortly after arriving at Matata,” he said. Rangwe subcounty police commander Jane Sang said they allowed the student to sit her papers in the health facility due to her illness. She said they had been informed about her condition. “We were informed about the unfortunate demise of the girl. She passed on while seeking treatment,” Sang said. The police officer said they will conduct a postmortem to know what caused the death of the candidate. She said other students have continued with exams smoothly. “I assure remaining students and the school stakeholders of smooth examinations,” she said.
