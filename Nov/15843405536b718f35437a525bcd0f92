Wajir woman rep Fatuma Gedi has hit back at Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa after sexual misconduct accusations. Barasa on Thursday accused Gedi of being sexually involved with younger boys including her bodyguards and drivers. But in a quick rejoinder, Gedi accused Barasa of being a "conman". She included a copy of the public notice by Sportpesa dissociating Barasa from any business with them. The two have been involved in bitter exchange since the Kibra by-election two weeks ago. Taking to Twitter where they traded barbs attracting different reactions from social media users. Here are some comments: This comes four days after DCI boss George Kinoti was put on the spot for the delayed investigation into a sex tape linked to Gedi. She dismissed as fake the tape that went viral in December last year. Since Gedi made a formal complaint with the DCI in February this year, the file has been gathering dust. Detectives have cited ‘impediments’ in having four MPs record statements, though they have been identified as persons of interest in connection with the circulation of the tape.
