Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa was on Thursday questioned by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations  over embezzlement of over Sh57 million CDF cash. Her lawyers, Danstan Omari and Cliff Ombeta, said she was called into the DCI to shed light on the matter. Ombeta said Jumwa needed time to respond to the queries because the matter was brought up "off the cuff" and verification needed to be done. Last month, Jumwa found herself in trouble after being linked to the fatal shooting of ODM Ganda ward candidate Reuben Katana's uncle. Jumwa and her bodyguard, Okuto Otieno, were granted Sh1 million bond and a surety of a similar amount with the alternative of Sh500,000  bail each on October 17. "The two shall be released but they must present themselves to DCIO in Malindi on October 22... any further summons shall be issued," Mombasa Senior Resident Magistrate Vincent Adet said.
