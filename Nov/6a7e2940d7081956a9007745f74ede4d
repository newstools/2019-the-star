 Twenty-nine boreholes have been drilled in Nairobi to ease the city's water shortage problems, Athi Water Works Development Agency MD Machael Thuita has said. Thuita son Friday said the boreholes will provide 10 million litres of water everyday to a targeted 200,000 people, most of who live in informal settlements. The boreholes are in all the 17 subcounties. “The boreholes will contribute to alleviating water deficiency in the city,” Thuita said in a statement. Nairobi has a daily shortfall of 250 million litres of water with many residents often forced to rely on vendors who sell a 20-litre jerrican for as much as Sh50. The Nairobi county government has been rationing supply to cope with the deficit. Thuita said a majority of the boreholes are already in operation including the ones at Kibra Primary and Moi Girls in Kibra constituency. Others are at Langata Health Centre, Joseph Kangethe Social Hall, Kenyatta University Field Area, Embakasi Health Centre, Wilson Airport Reservoir, Garden Estate Secondary School, Kamala Police Station, Karen Shopping Area BPT, Kenyatta Market, Maisha Poa Centre, ASK Jamuhuri Grounds, Loresho Ground Reservoir, Kabarnet Gardens, Gigiri Reservoir, Kabete Water Works, Ndurarua Primary School and at the SGR Terminus. Thuita said they drilled the boreholes in a deal entered between the county government and the Ministry of Water. A total of 40 emergency boreholes are to be drilled at a cost of Sh200 million. “AWWDA was appointed as the implementing agency for the emergency boreholes. The 200 million was sufficient for the development of 29 boreholes. To complete the remaining 11 boreholes,  Sh100 million is required,” he said.  edited by peter obuya
