Senators have demanded the completion of road expansion works at the Malaba border to ease movement of goods to and from Uganda. The Senate Committee on Roads and Transport on Friday toured the Malaba One Stop Border Post in Busia and came face to face long queue of trucks waiting to cross into Uganda. Committee chairman Kimani Wamatangi said the facility’s pathetic road portrayed a negative image of Kenya. He said it was unfair for traders to move all the way from Mombasa only to get stuck at the Malaba border. “Around 200 metres of the road has a challenge and should be fixed.  It was not fair for a contractor to be given a contract worth Sh600 million and be dismissed after being paid Sh550 million," Wamatangi said. Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula asked the national government to immediately address traffic congestion at the border. He said traffic delays were eating into government revenues and poses risks to traders. “This is because some trucks carry fuel that is flammable,” Wetang'ula said. The senator advised the committee to immediately present its report to the national government and push for action. “In my view, the work should be completed within the next three to four months,” Wetang'ula said. The Malaba One Stop Border Port is the second busiest facility in Africa in terms of trade volume but traders have often complained of slow clearance.  edited by p. obuya
