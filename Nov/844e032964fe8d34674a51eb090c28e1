Governor Alex Tolgos of Elgeyo Marakwet who is facing a Sh200 million fuel probe by the EACC  on Tuesday came out to defend himself. He says the probe is a witch-hunt. The governor said he has not been at peace since he came out fighting against graft in connection with the Arror and Kimwarer dams. Tolgos has been summoned to appear at the EACC's Integrity Centre on Thursday at 9am to record a statement over fuel supplies He blames his problems on the Arror and Kimwarer dams projects. President Uhuru Kenyatta cancelled the Kimwarer project and ordered construction to begin immediately on the scaled-back Arror dam. Both were overpriced and virtually no work was done. “It’s the ghosts of Arror and Kimwarer that are now fighting back but I can assure everyone that no money has been lost under my watch as governor," Tolgos said. The EACC said it is investigating the county boss over tenders to supply fuel to the county by firms associated with him. One of the companies reportedly supplied petroleum products for four years. EACC Chief Executive Twalib Mbarak wrote to Tolgos summoning him to appear before the commission to shed light on the allegations. Mbarak said in the letter seen by the Star that the commission has been investigating procurement irregularities by the county during the 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18 financial years. The governor was instructed to bring all original documents about ownership of the companies. The commission is also investigating claims that since 2016, companies associated top county officials were also awarded contracts worth Sh80 million in other counties. (Edited by V. Graham)
