Two police officers have been arrested alongside four civilians found stealing Tarmal Wire Products. Dominic Wambua and  Edward Osiyo were arrested on Sunday night after stealing from a truck that veered off the road. The two are based at Kambu Police Post in Makueni. Pius Kimuyu, Pius Wambua, Wambua Ndege and  Cosmas Kilonzo are in custody pending arraignment. "The driver who had avoided ramming into other road-users had gone to report the accident at the said post," DCI George Kinoti said on Monday. "...only to get back to the M/V & find Constables standing watch as four men offloaded the goods to an Isuzu Pickup." Kinoti said DCI Detectives based at Mtito-Andei who were patrolling the area detected the crime and ambushed the suspects. The vehicles have been detained for further police action.
