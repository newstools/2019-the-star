Promotion hopefuls Migori Youth are on the verge of securing a sponsorship deal with Bansi Wholesalers, a firm based within the county. Club chairman Abdi Aziz Hosman revealed that they had fruitful talks with the firm and it was just a matter of time before a deal is inked. “We have engaged Bansi for a while now and they have been keen to come on board and support our project. We are only waiting for the finer details to be ironed out before we ascertain their involvement,” said Aziz. Earlier this week, Bansi footed the club’s accommodation and transport bills when they travelled to Mombasa for their National Super League clash against Modern Coast United which they lost 1-0. “As a firm based in Migori, we endeavour to support home grown initiatives that are beneficial to the youth and society. We are in talks with Migori and we catered for their trip to the Coast recently. We now are strongly considering a partnership with them to help with the welfare of the team,” said Bansi Junior, the firm’s manager. Despite their financial predicament, Migori are still very much in the frame for promotion. They lie in fifth place with 24 points—six points adrift of the final automatic promotion slot occupied by Nairobi Stima. Migori will continue their push for promotion with a home game in Awendo against struggling St. Joseph on Monday. Table toppers City Stars will hope to return to winning ways after a draw with Talanta when they host Murang’a Seals. Stima will be away to Shabana while fourth placed Vihiga United will entertain Kenya Police in Mumias.
