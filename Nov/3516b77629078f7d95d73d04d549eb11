Four suspects in the murder of former Kabete MP George Muchai and his three aides have been given more time to file an application to have a judge recuse himself over claims of bias. The matter came up on Wednesday to confirm if the application had been made after they requested to do so last month. Justice James Wakiaga gave them seven days to make their application and appear in court on November 28. Last month, Raphael Kimani aka Kim Butcher, Kimani Anyonyi AKA Musti, Stephen Lipapo aka Chokore and Erick Muyera aka chairman requested Justice Wakiaga to disqualify himself from the case as they had lost confidence in him. "We are not satisfied with this court. We have lost confidence in it and we want the court to disqualify itself for being biased," they said. The suspects, who are remanded at Kamiti Maximum Prison, failed to appear in court a week ago in protest. Their co-accused Jane Kamau and Margaret Wachuiri, however, said they have no problem with the trial judge and want the case to proceed without further delay. Wakiaga directed the suspects and any other party to file a formal application raising their reasons why they want him out of the case. The suspects are accused of murdering Muchai, his driver Stephen Wambugu and bodyguards Samuel Kalikia and Samuel Matanta on February 6, 2015, on Kenyatta Avenue in Nairobi county. The application prompted the stalling of the case which had been scheduled for two consecutive weeks. So far, three witnesses have testified among the listed 41. All the accused have been in custody since March 2015 when they were charged with four counts of murder and robbery with violence. Edited by R.Wamochie
