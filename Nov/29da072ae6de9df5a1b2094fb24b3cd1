The cost of living measure hit a four-month high in November driven by higher food prices. Data by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows inflation rose to 5.56 per cent in November from 4.95 per cent the previous month. “This was due to an increase in prices of some foodstuffs outweighing decrease recorded in respect of others,” KNBS director-general Zachary Mwangi said in the monthly statement. This is marginally lower than 5.58 per cent reported over the same period last year. The data shows the price of a 2kg pack of sifted maize floor recorded the largest increase of 55.1 per cent to Sh130.77 compared, up from Sh84.32 the same month last year. A kilogramme of tomatoes also increased 43.1 per cent to retail at Sh95.78 compared to Sh66.93 last year.
