The disciplines include athletics under coach Stephen Lagat, badminton under Sheila Gakii, basketball led by coach Sylvester Ndindi, cycling tutored by Johnson Chiungu, handball trained by Gerald Abunde and hockey five-aside under the tutelage of Michael Malungu. Others are Judo under Lawrence Nyundo, rugby sevens coached by Nicholas Abala, taekwondo under Vincent Ochieng, tennis coached by Peter Rakuom, triathlon by Malik Mwabondo, beach volleyball by Sammy Mulinge and wrestling under John Mburu. The camp began on Sunday and will be officially launched tomorrow by National Olympic Committee of Kenya President Paul Tergat. Nock acting secretary-general Francis Mutuku said that national federations shared their criteria for identifying athlete nationally including their international qualification guidelines to ensure the selections are objective and accountable. "The camp aims at nurturing young talents in the country with a view to enable as many youths as possible to participate in the Youth Olympic Games in Dakar. Nock considers these Games as a great platform to kick start the participants' professional careers in sports," said Mutuku. He reiterated that preparations of athletes is very important so Nock cannot leave anything to chance. The multi-sports camp will mould the youths all round, including technical coaching, strength and conditioning, nutrition, mentorship, personal branding, media presentation and other social activities. "This camp will be an opportunity for Nock's technical team to interact with the coaches to understand the dynamics of each sport and forge a strategy for retaining these athletes on their pathway to professional sports career," he added.
