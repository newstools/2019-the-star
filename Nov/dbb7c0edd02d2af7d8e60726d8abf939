Twitter users have been responding with hilarity to photos of Faf de Klerk greeting Prince Harry with just his underpants on after South Africa's Rugby World Cup win on Saturday. In the changing room, the Springboks' halfback stripped down to his patriotic green, yellow underpants and shook hands with Prince Harry when he visited the team to congratulate them. Still near naked, Faf de Klerk then filled the World Cup trophy with champagne, drank from it and passed it round his team mates.
