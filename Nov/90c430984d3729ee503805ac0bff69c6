World marathon record holders Eliud Kipchoge and Brigid Kosgei are some of the top athletes invited for the second edition of Athletics Kenya (AK) Athlete's Conference set for Eldoret between December 4 and 7. Others expected world marathon champion Ruth Chepngetich, New York marathon champion Joyciline Jepkosgei, Chicago Marathon winner Lawrence Cherono and New York Marathon champion Geoffrey Kamworor. World and Commonwealth Games 5,000m champion Helen Obiri is also on the invited list alongside Olympic 5,000m and 2018 London Marathon champion Vivian Cheruiyot. Over 300 athletes are expected to converge in Eldoret for the four-day seminar. The invite-only conference, whose theme is ‘I choose Integrity’ will be graced by IAAF’s Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) officials, who will specifically deal with anti-doping matters. Athletics Kenya executive committee member Barnaba Korir said other areas to be discussed include ethics, investment, taxation and athlete-media relations. Korir added that a marathon and road runners’ doping session on an opening day (December 4) will precede the main three-day event featuring track and field stars. The event is mandatory for the invited athletes, failure to which there will be consequences. Apart from marathoners and road racers, the conference will also feature youths, juniors and 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games probables. Korir noted that with next year being a busy one, it was imperative the federation and athletes get their planning and preparations right in good time. "It will be a busy year with the Olympics, World Under-20 Championships, African Championships and Cross Country and we will plan accordingly to ensure that our athletes win as many medals as possible,” added Korir. AK will use the conference as the first step towards 2020 Olympics Games preparations as required by World Athletics, with the main topic for discussion being anti-doping and advise on the best way to remain and compete clean.
