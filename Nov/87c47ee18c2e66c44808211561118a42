Oil marketer OLA Energy (formerly OiLibya) has launched fuel formulation as part of its growth and rebrands strategy. Dubbed O’ptimium, the fuel is made through the addition of performance additives that help clean car engines hence controlling deposit build-up in critical points of the engine including inlet injectors. “Through this innovation, motorists will have a better experience on roads through increased fuel economy, reduced corrosion, prevent filter blockage, better car acceleration, reduced emissions, and greater engine durability, OLA Energy MD Millicent Onyonyi said. She added that the fuel has been developed using cutting edge additives and technologies that are tested in accredited laboratories in accordance with international standards. The move is part of the firm’s strategy to establish its footprint in the country after buying out an established brand. The product is expected to give Vivo Energy’s Shell V-Power a run for its money. “This underscores our commitment to being one of the key downstream players in this market by providing high-quality products and services that in turn will ensure significant benefits to all our customers,” concluded Mrs. Onyonyi. O’ptimium fuels for both petrol and diesel engines are available to customers in Nairobi, Mt. Kenya region and Mombasa at no additional cost. It is adaptable to all vehicles irrespective of their age and model. The firm plans to role out the product across the country by the end of this month.
