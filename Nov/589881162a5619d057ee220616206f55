The High Court has ordered IEBC to supply ODM with the complete voter register with voters' IDs in compliance with the law. IEBC on Wednesday said it will be a challenge to comply with the order and requested for 10 days. The commission said materials have already been taken to Kibra and it will be a challenge to supply the voter register. "If we are to print the register, then it will be a great challenge. We cannot contact Delarue in the next two hours," the IEBC's lawyer said. The commission wanted a stay of the judgement. However, ODM opposed it, arguing that the process is an automated one and that the IEBC need only click a button and all information will be availed. "The arguments are evasive, if you grant orders of stay you would basically have declared your judgement redundant," ODM's lawyer said. Justice James Makau declined to issue a stay of the judgement and IEBC has a few hours before Thursday morning to comply with the orders of the court. ODM had sued the IEBC, saying the commission had provided an incomplete voter register. The Orange party had said the ID numbers provided were incomplete. However, the IEBC had said it provided a complete register, adding that the ID numbers were truncated for security reasons. Following the Wednesday ruling, ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna said the party was ready to pick the register, even if it is provided in the middle of the night.
