The battle over former minister Mbiyu Koinange’s multi-billion shillings estate case has been pushed to February next year. The case has been pending in court forever 35 years due to disagreements by beneficiaries of the estate, on how the wealth should be distributed. Justice Aggrey Muchelule yesterday directed the matter proceeds on February 18 after conducting a site visit on one of the expansive farms belonging to the former Cabinet minister Thursday afternoon. The tour of the Closeburn Estate began from the Two Rivers Mall, to Karura community chapel to Havillan Cornerstone and other properties to confirm the extensive investments in the occupied properties. The Closeburn was originally 692 acres but some portions have already been sold out. Some 250 acres were sold to the Aga Khan Group, 100 acres to Centum and 50 acres sold to Karura community chapel. The Judge directed parties to file the necessary documents ahead of the fresh dates. The surveyor will also be required to put in an affidavit following the observations made during the cite visit. Koinange died on September 3, 1981 without a Will.  His household had four wives being Loise Njeri, Ruth Damaris Wambui, Margaret Njeri and Edda Wanjiru. The deceased’s first wife passed on before Koinange’s death while the second wife passed on after his demise. He had 12 children from his first two wives Loise Njeri (six children) and Ruth Damaris (six children). The said children of late Mbiyu are all adults aged between 74 and 51 years. Over 30 assets worth billions of shillings form part of the estate of the deceased that are available for distribution.
