Nakuru RFC acting coach Felix Oloo has urged his charges to rise to the occasion and beat Quins in the bottom of the table showdown on Saturday in Nakuru. Both former champions have lost their three opening matches of the season and the game will be of huge significance in this early part of the season. Both teams are ranked 11th and 12th—a far cry from yesteryears, where they used to dominate the league. Nakuru lost their opening match to cross-town rivals Menengai Oilers 31-5, fell  15-10 to Homeboyz and 50-13 to reigning champions KCB. Oloo observed that Saturday's match presents an ideal opportunity to win their first game of the season. "We are in transition with a new coaching team and young players. I hope very soon we can go on a good run and climb the table,” added Oloo.  He said the fundamental of his team is in good shape and he will be keen to execute their attacking and defensive patterns. "In our last game against KCB,  our scrum and lineout were good. It's only in the open play where we need to be sharper in both defence and attack," added Oloo. He said with a long season ahead, he is confident his charges will turn round things. “ I'm not worried. It's a 19-week season and you have seen teams struggling at the start before improving towards the end of the season," he added. The tactician said Quins will be desperate to win their first game. "We are both in the same boat. The game will, therefore, be tricky and whoever can take their chances and minimise on errors, will carry the day” added Oloo. He said playing at home will be an added incentive for the team. “We are playing at home and we want to make our fans happy by winning the match," he said.
