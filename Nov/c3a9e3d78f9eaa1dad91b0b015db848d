The Machakos government has warned that those illegally dumping waste will be punished. Speaking on Thursday during a clean-up drive for Machakos town and environs, Environment director Phylis Kalungu said the county has invested a lot and those ignorant of the law will face severe punishment. She said the county has also increased security to monitor officers alleged to be dumping in Machakos subcounties from their neighbouring counties. "We have been able to contain this careless behaviour and we will not allow anyone to come and dump their solid waste in our county," Kalungu said. Kalungu said his department will continue to create awareness of solid waste management and ensure enforcement of the law. The clean-up exercise was carried out by the Machakos Environment department with Green Life Africa, Machakos University, Machakos Medical Institution and Bristol Park Hospital, among others. Green Life Africa director Samuel Nguta urged the county government to be innovative in waste management. He warned Kenyans not to dump into the environment or on river banks. He said solid waste can be improved and recycled to manufacture fertilisers. "I urge Kenyans to make proper use of solid waste instead of dumping in rivers or on the roadside. It's our responsibility to clean our environment," Nguta said. (Edited by R. Wamochie)
