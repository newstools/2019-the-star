A body of unknown man was found decomposing at Kalundu river, in Kwangima area in the outskirts of Kitui town. Members  of the public, who were  crossing  the river, including this year’s KCPE  candidates returning home, spotted the floating  body on Thursday afternoon. It is not clear whether the man drowned after the heavy downpour or if he was murdered and thrown into the river. The heavy downpour has claimed many lives in Kitui as many bodies have been recovered in different running rivers. The body was later retrieved by police and taken to Kitui Level V Hospital mortuary. On Tuesday, police in Matinyani, Kitui, recovered bodies of a woman and her child stuck in debris in the flooded Mutendea river. Matinyani subcounty police commander John Sawe said besides trying to establish the identity of the woman and her son, the police would seek to establish how they got into the river. “It is not clear how the woman, whose body was found alongside that of her one-year-old son, who was strapped across the chest, got into the water. We are investigating,” he said. Sawe said the bodies appear to have remained in the water for at least three days and were decomposing when they were discovered.
