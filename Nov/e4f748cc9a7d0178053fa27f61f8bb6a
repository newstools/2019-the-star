The Nakuru county government has expressed concern over the high number of loaded fuel tankers parked in major towns and residential areas. The county wants to partner with the Kenya Pipeline Company to construct designated parking lots for the tankers part of disaster management. Youth executive Lucy Kariuki said the county had mapped out areas prone to disaster and had identified parkings used by oil tankers. She said the county was ready to provide land for such facilities which would be equipped with fire fighting equipment. “We have 150km of petroleum pipeline that passes through Nakuru, several pumping stations and there is a need now for KPC to consider constructing parking for these loaded fuel tankers,” she said. Kariuki said the county had set aside Sh160 million towards the construction of a modern fire station in Nakuru town as one way of disaster management. Plans are under way to construct extra fire stations in Naivasha, Molo and Olenguruoni. Kariuki spoke at Morendat Institute of Oil and Gas in Naivasha during the graduation ceremony for 30 firefighters who had been supported by the county government. “We have a disaster management bill currently being discussed in the county assembly and we are in the process of mapping out disaster prone areas,” she said. During the ceremony, county secretary Benjamin Njoroge said disasters that hit the county had taught them lessons and the need to plan. He pointed to the Solai Dam tragedy that left 48 people dead and the Kinung multicar incident that left 25 people dead as some of the disasters that had adversely affected the county.
