Newly-crowned Kenya Volleyball Federation national champions General Service Unit and Kenya Prisons will represent the country at the 2020 Africa Club Championships after successfully defending their local titles at the Safaricom Indoor Arena yesterday. The two retained their title after winning all their three playoff matches to retain the titles in their respective categories. GSU will be joined by fallen finalist Kenya Ports Authority in the men’s edition while Kenya Commercial Bank will play alongside Prisons at the continental club bonanza whose dates and venue are yet to be announced. GSU thwarted KPA’s campaign to win their maiden league title in straight sets of 3-0 (25-19, 25-21, 25-23). “We have done well and now turn to preparation for African Club Championships. This time we have to find the winning formular,” said GSU coach Gideon Tarus. Kenya Prisons (women) beat KCB in straight sets of 25-22, 25-19 and 25-23 to leave coach Josp Barasa an elated man. “It was not an easy tie but I am happy we have we retained the title. We now take a break for national team activities and the festivities and will resume club training ahead of both the league and continental in January,” said Barasa. Prisons started the game on a slow note trailing KCB 6-8 and 11-16 at technical timeouts. Former Kenya international Lydia Maiyo, who came in for Immaculate Chemtai was the game-changer for Prisons. Her presence cut out the fire in KCB’s camp, helping her side bag the first set 25-22. In the second set, the bankers played a chase-game as Prisons led from start to end with an 8-2 lead at the first pep-talk. KCB’s Leonida Kasaya’s blocking combination with teenager Belinda Barasa saw KCB narrow the gap to 10-8 but unforced errors by coach Japheth Munala’s charges saw the gap widen at 16-9 at the second technical timeout. KCB put their acts late in the set but Prisons held onto their lead to win 25-19. The warders romped to aN 8-6, 16-9 in the decider before KCB closed in 21-19 but, once again, it counted for nothing as the uniformed side went on to win the set 25-23 and the game altogether. After seeing their campaign to retain the title hit the wall, Kenya Pipeline saved themselves the blushes to beat whipping girls Directorate of Criminal Investigations 3-0 (32-30, 25-22, 25-22) in the third place playoff.
