There will be no Parliament sitting on Wednesday, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has announced. This follows an invitation to MPs by President Uhuru Kenyatta to the public release of the BBI report. "Honourable Members, following His Excellency the President's appointment of the Taskforce on Building Bridges to Unity Advisory vide Gazette Notice 5154 of 24th May, 2018, His Excellency the President has notified that there will be a public launch of the Report of the Task force on Wednesday, November 27, 2019 at the Bomas of Kenya, Nairobi at 10 a.m," Muturi said in a memo on Tuesday. Uhuru on Tuesday received the Building Bridges Initiative task force report. The handover was made at State House in the presence of opposition leader Raila Odinga, Deputy President William Ruto and the leadership of Parliament. The details of the report will be released to the public on Wednesday at The Bomas of Kenya. The task force chairman Senator Yusuf Haji last week said the report covers all the views the team collected across the country. Haji added that the task force was able to collect views from more than 400 elected leaders and Kenyans in the 47 counties.
