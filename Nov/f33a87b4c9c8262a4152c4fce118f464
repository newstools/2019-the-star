Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko was heckled at the Bomas of Kenya after he started complaining to President Uhuru Kenyatta in his speech at the Bomas of Kenya during the launch of the BBI report Sonko, who had had been invited to the podium by the Council of Governors chairman and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said there was a widow in upper hill who is being terrorised by cartels that needed to be checked. "Kuna widow ambaye bwana yake alikuwa chef ya baba yako.. tunaomba proposal yetu... kwa zile proposals tuweze ku deal na cartels..." he said. But as he said this, the delegates chanted BBI, BBI... forcing him to cut short his speech. "Hataa hii mambo naongelelea ni BBI. Jana wakati hii report ilitolewa nilifurahi kwa sababau uliongelelea joblessness ..." he added. Sonko further noted that organisers of the event had done a terrible job. "...organiser wameanguka wote vile watu wanakaribishwa hapa ni mbovu... rais umekuwa ukinitetea sana nikidhulumiwa, " he said. Kenya will see the return of the position of Prime Minister if the Building Bridges Initiative Taskforce proposals are to be implemented in full. The BBI team appeared to make proposals that would lead Kenyans to a referendum with all proposal made likely to come through Bills or policy changes. The report proposes that Kenyans continue to elect their President who remains the Head of State and Government. The report also says that the Deputy President should remain the principal assistant to the President and will be the running mate.
