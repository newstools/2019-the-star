After a five-year hiatus, the Diamond 10k Series has been revived and the first race will be held on November 30 in Nairobi. The last race was held in 2014 in Nairobi and organisers have asserted that they are here to stay this time around under the leadership of Right Here Golazo Kenya managing director Betty Kairo. Speaking during the launch of this year's edition, Kairo said the event returns in a big way and will feature five categories in both genders. The categories include the open/ elite runners, wheelchair, masters for those between the ages of 45 and 59, veterans for the over 59 years and corporates. The first race is being funded to a tune of Sh1.48mand organisers have promised to launch the subsequent legs early next year. The event, whose motto is to encourage people to keep moving, will feature races in major towns across the countries. "The series will be held in major towns in the country as from 2020 with the aim of unearthing young talent. The series is a healthy fun-filled run seeking to develop tomorrow's world champions,” said Kairo. Winners of the 10k open category will take home Sh200,000, runners up will pocket Sh100,000 while the third-placed athletes walk away with Sh50,000. Wheelchairs podium finishers will get  Sh75,000, Sh50,000 and Sh25,000 respectively. Kairo also indicated that in addition to the cash prize awards, medallists in each category, winners will be awarded an artefact of diamonds. The race will be unique from the rest since it will start at 2 pm and take athletes around the Central Business District. Runners will have to part with Sh1,000 for registration and the process is already ongoing at the AK offices at Riadha House and online at diamond10kseries.com.
