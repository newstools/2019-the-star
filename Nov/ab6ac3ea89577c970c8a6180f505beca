Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong'o's son Peter Junior and his longtime girlfriend Wanja Wohoro held their engagement ceremony last weekend. Wanja, who's from an old-money family, and Junior Nyong'o have been dating for quite a while. Their engagement party was held at a posh and an undisclosed location in the city.

They included Wanja's family, the governor's daughter Zawadi Nyong'o, Patricia Kihoro, artiste Karun, runway model trainer Letoya Johnstone, Blinky Bill, Karen Lucas. Junior wore a white T-shirt, a safari hat and sayari pants, while Wanja wore an African print romper. While addressing guests, Junior, who also refers to himself as flower boy, said, "In the first year, I was just looking at rings and different stuff. Got her a ring from a jewellery shop that made the rings for 'Lord of the Rings'." A source told Word Is, "They are planning for a wedding and it will be a surprise." Photos from their engagement were shared on social media, with guests congratulating them. Letoya shared photos of the couple, congratulating them. "I am honored to have had a chance to see love first hand. I was honestly honoured to be invited to the engagement party of @juniornyongo and @wanjawohoro with his golden-hearted girlfriend today." "May the good Lord continue to bless you and keep the laughter flowing. Such a great storyteller," she wrote. Both Junior and Wanja are artistes and have worked on several projects together. Their latest song is titled 'Bright'.
