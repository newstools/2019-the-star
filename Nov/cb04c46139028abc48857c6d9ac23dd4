Quins coach Dominique Habimana thinks an improved defensive effort will help his charges move up on the Kenya Cup log. The Ngong-Road giants bagged their first win of the season last week, beating Menengai Oilers 25-15 after four consecutive defeats. Habimana termed the win a turning point and hopes his side can kick on with matches coming up against Mwamba, Impala and Blak Blad. "Our defence was the difference in the win against Oilers and we need to replicate that against Mwamba, Impala and Blak Blad in our three remaining fixtures before the year ends,” he added. Quins now lie ninth on the log with six points from five matches played in the campaign so far. Habimana said he is optimistic his charges will qualify for the playoffs despite the slow start to the season. "It's a very long season and teams will drop points and there will be twists and turns in the campaign. We will, therefore, fight to the end of the season,” noted Habimana The former Simbas and Nakuru coach expects a stern test from Mwamba this weekend. “They have played well and they are a good team but I am delighted with the route our team is taking and we are ready for the challenge,” he noted. Mwamba have had a poor record against Quins in the last two seasons, losing the last two matches 31-26 last season and 26-18 in the 2017/2018 season.
