The Council Of Governors has said that the vacancy in the office of the Controller Of Budget has left counties without funds. CoG chairperson Wycliffe Oparanya said on Friday through a press statement that county governments are facing challenges in requisition of public funds from the Revenue Accounts. This is due to the expiry term of the designated Acting Controller of Budget Agness Odhiambo which came to an end in April. They also said the three-month term designated to the Acting Controller of Budget expired on Monday 25, November, has worsened the situation. "To this extent, the term of the designated Acting Controller of Budget of 90 days expired on Monday 25th November 2019. Ultimately this has led to the inability of County Governments to withdraw any funds from the Revenue Accounts," part of the CoG statement reads. On November 19, President Uhuru Kenyatta nominated Margaret Nyakango as the new Controller of Budget. She is still waiting for the Committee on Finance and National Planning to vet her before being approved by the President. If she sails through the Committee, Nyakango will replace Agnes Odhiambo who term came to an end in August. County governments have also been unable to pay November month salaries, statutory deductions, and procured supplies, including the pending bills. The council is, therefore, asking the national government to fill in the position of the Controller of Budget and to disburseÂ all the pending allocations that are long overdue. It also says that the 47 counties are on the brink of missing out on their targets for service delivery.
