Babu Tale, Diamond's manager, has responded to Ali Kiba's rant after the 'Chekecha Cheketua' hitmaker declined WCB's offer to perform at their festival. Diamond first broke the news at a press conference that Ali Kiba would be among those headlining his festival. He said last week at the press conference, "Before going to the US, Babu Tale reached out to Ali Kiba to ask him to be at the festival. Music is about competition, but when it comes to big things like this, people come together." Adding, "These things are not personal, no wonder Nigerians are going far. We should not accept to be split apart by people who just want to hate. By doing that, we are killing the industry." He said Harmonize, who recently left the label, is also scheduled to perform. "Festival ni yetu sote, Harmonize, huku ndio nyumbani kwake. He has his own schedule but we believe he will reschedule it, so that he will come for the festival." Babu Tale says he has now left Ali Kiba alone, just as the singer had requested. "Amesema unikome, na mimi nimemkoma, hata kumzungumzia, tumemkoma," he told Wasafi Media on Tuesday. Previously, the 'Aje' singer had taken to social media to throw shade at Diamond after he received a call from Tale. He wrote in Kiswahili, "Don't bring a class two behaviour to me, you steal my pencil and help me search for it. Leave me alone. A man only talks once and if you want me to expose you so that people know what you are doing to me even at that festival, people won't come. I rest my case and wish you a successful festival."
