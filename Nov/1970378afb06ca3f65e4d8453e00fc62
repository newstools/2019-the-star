Police in Makueni county are holding seven suspects in connection with theft of electronics and gas in Wote town. County police commander Joseph Napeiyan said TV sets, radios, laptops, cameras, and phones were recovered in a shop in Githurai 44 in Nairobi. Four of the suspects were arrested at a roadblock along Wote - Machakos road as they were escaping in a vehicleÂ  after an attempt to break into a house failed. Police gave chase following a tip off by a security guard manning a petrol station who had suspected their movement. "The suspects we had arrested led police officers to a shop in Githurai 44 area in Nairobi where we recovered the electronics and gas cylinders which they admitted to have stolen here in Wote town. We also arrested three more suspects," Napeiyan told reporters at Makueni police station on Thursday. He said they suspected the items might have been stolen after the men broke into different houses in the town. Cases of houses being broken into and theft of property have been on the rise in the town for the last three months. "We are doing more investigations to find out who else is behind the theft and see if we can recover more stolen goods," Napeiyan said. He said the suspects had been using a vehicle whose number plate they kept changing to avoid being tracked. The suspects were arraigned at Makueni law courts on Thursday but police asked for 14 more days to complete the probe. The recovered items were displayed at Makueni police station for owners to identify and collect them. Napeiyan urged residents to cooperate with the police and report any suspected criminal.
