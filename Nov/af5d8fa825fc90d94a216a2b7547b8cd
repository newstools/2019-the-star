Kangema High School Warriors garnered the third win of the season after edging Kaluluini Boys 33-32 in the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) National League at Kaloleni Sports grounds yesterday. The last two seconds of the match were crucial for the side from Muranga after holding nerve to avoid a 32-all draw. Coached by Kennedy Odhiambo, Warriors had a poor start to the league but the boys were in high spirit yesterday when they faced their peers. “The boys were highly motivated today and had vowed to amass maximum points. However, it was not an easy affair, playing Kaluluini,” said Odhiambo. It was a give-and-take affair as the proceedings got underway but Kaluluini settled for a two-goal advantage (16-18) at the breather. Upon resumption, Kluluini conceded several turnovers giving their opponents the chance to close in. Leading 32-31 and with half a minute to go, Kaluluini's talisman Amos Mutiso levelled matters 32-32 and with two seconds on the clock, Crifan Osanya scored the winning goal. Mutiso scored game-high of 13 goals as Fidel Katua chipped in 10 in the losing efforts. Moses Oduor top-scored for Warriors with nine goals as Osanya added six. The winners will break camp for school holidays and resume league action in January. Other matches played at the same venue saw Kaluluini Girls fall 20-26 to Kenyatta University, Technical University of Kenya pipped varsity counterparts UoE Pippers 30-22, Nanyuki hammered Warriors 40-17 and Black Mamba whitewashed Gunners 52-21. In an all varsity encounter, Mt. Kenya University and Pippers shared spoils 26-26.
