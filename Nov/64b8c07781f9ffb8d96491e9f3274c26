Diamond Platnumz and Tanasha Donna celebrated their newborn’s first 40 days yesterday. The couple welcomed their son Naseeb on October 2. The blue-themed event was attended by the who’s who in the Tanzanian entertainment industry. In a number of cultures a mother and her newborn spend 40 days in confinement to give the woman time to heal and bond with her baby. The number 40 also has religious significance in other cultures. The singer’s mother Sandrah, aka Mama Dangote, told Wasafi media, “Tanasha is the one who chose the baby’s name. I think its because he was born on the same date as the father.” She said her grandchild might follow in her son’s footsteps and become a superstar. “I think all my grandchildren are okay. But with Naseeb, when he is crying and you get him into the studio, he keeps quiet. I think he will follow in his father’s footsteps and become an artist,” she said Naseeb is Diamond’s fourth child but Tanasha’s firstborn. He has two children with Zari Hassan and one with Hamisa Mobetto.
