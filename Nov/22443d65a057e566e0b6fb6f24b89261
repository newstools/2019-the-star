The AgriFI Kenya on Wednesday held a reception at Movenpick Hotel, Nairobi. Funded by the European Union and the SlovakAid, it aims to support productive and market-integrated smallholder agriculture through the provision of financial support to agri-enterprises. Over Sh460 million in financial support was on offer for pastoralist/smallholder farmer integration and business expansion. It was given to agribusinesses involved in the production and processing of coconut, sorghum, soya, mango, avocado oil and dairy.
