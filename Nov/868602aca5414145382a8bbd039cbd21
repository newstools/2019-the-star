Nairobi Diaries actress Bridget Achieng has opened up on her last conversation with her mother. She lost her mother two months after she welcomed her son Sekani. “My mum had a good heart and was very patient with people. Before she died, I sent her Baby Sekani’s photos,” Bridget said. “She called me and asked me to be patient with people and not to expect something from people and that I should not stop being good. Her mother’s lessons have helped her get through life. “I learnt and its working for me,” Bridget said. “I don’t want to say God was not fair but my career was picking up and she went. “She wanted a grandchild. I looked for the baby for five years with my first man, it wasn’t successful. “[With] my second boyfriend, who was Nigerian, it was also not successful. My Nigerian man left me because he said I didn’t want to have a child with him.” After her Nigerian boyfriend left her she met Sekani’s dad. “I was introduced to my baby’s father by a friend. I was swept off [my feet]. He spoilt me,” Bridget said. “Before long I was pregnant and he was OK with it [at first] but three months later he asked me to abort. “I refused.” She wanted a baby before she was 30 so she decided to keep the child, whether his dad wanted him or not. “Before I learn I was pregnant I started feeling funny, I took three pregnancy tests and they all turned out positive,” Bridget said. “I then decided to go to a hospital and got the confirmation that I was one month pregnant.” She has moved on and is currently organising NAI Fest. The event will go down at Ngong Racecourse Waterfront from noon till 6am on 30th November. Artistes lined up include rapper Fena Gitu, Ochungulo Family, Ethic, Boondocks and Sailors.
