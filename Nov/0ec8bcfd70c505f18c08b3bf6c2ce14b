Tear gas and commotion marked Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko's entry into the EACC offices at Integrity Centre on Tuesday. Police lobbed the tear gas cannisters at a group of people who tried to force their way in to EACC as Sonko entered. Trouble started at the gate, when Sonko tried to enter the EACC offices with his car, despite police requesting him to walk inside. Police then lobbed tar gas canisters when a group of youths tried to force their way in, making Sonko's team drive off, only to return and be directed to walk in. Sonko finally made his way into the centre, walking, accompanied by his lawyer, county attorney Lydia Kwamboka and some CECs. EACC investigators summoned Sonko last week for allegedly lying in his self-declaration form when he sought clearance to contest for governor.
