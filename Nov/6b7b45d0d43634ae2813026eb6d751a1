The society today is still hell-bent on building a milieu where rape has been normalised and defended like a non-issue. This trend is atrocious and scary especially to the poor child who cannot access legal aid. People convicted of rape have often been let scot-free because the wheels of justice move at a frictionless pace. In some incidences, Alternative Conflict Resolutions methods have been used to solve rape disputes. Causes of rape are vast in nature, but no matter the cause, itâ€™s an unacceptable and uncultured act in a civilised society.  Nairobi
