The daughter to former Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale has scored 396 marks in the just-released KCPE results. Khalwale took to Twitter on Tuesday to congratulate his daughter Gift Atubukha Khalwale for her exemplary performance. "For these blessings, I thank God, my family, and our hard-working teachers," Khalwale's twitter post read. In 2017, the Politician also publicly congratulated his daughter and son for scoring 407 and 406 marks in KCPE. Atubukha was among the 1,083,465 pupils who sat the KCPE exam. Out of these, 543,582 were boys and 539,874 were girls. While releasing the results at the KNEC headquarters in Nairobi, Education CS George Magoha said some 9,770 candidates scored above 400 marks. Andy Michael Munyiri was announced as the top candidate with 440 marks, followed by Flavian Onyango, June Cheptoo Koech and Sean Ndung'u  who tied in second place with 439 marks. Khalwale recently made headlines when he was among those who were caught up in the Kibra violence and he did not hesitate to show his dark side. The former senator who was in the constituency to ‘guard’ Jubilee's McDonald Mariga’s votes also hurled stones at rivals when they confronted him at the DC grounds.
