Impala Saracens fullback Anthony Odhiambo is a doubt for the Kenya Cup clash against Kabras. Odhiambo, who was capped by the Kenya Simbas in the Victoria Cup this year suffered a concussion in the opening match against Nondies last weekend and faces race to be fit for the trip to Kakamega. Odhiambo has been one of the most outstanding young talents in the league this season. The Sarries started the league on a positive note, winning two of their opening matches with bonus points against Nondies (26-14) and Blak Blad (57-9). Head coach Mitch Ocholla added that flanker Rainer Omondi has been ruled out to an ankle injury sustained at the Impala Floodlights last month. “We have a couple of injuries but I believe in the depth of our squad. We should be able to go through our upcoming fixtures," said Ocholla, who expects to have Samuel Motari back in the squad alongside Sammy Oliech. Motari has been injured since the national sevens circuit while Oliech has been away from the game due to personal commitments. Ocholla, who was appointed in September on a three-year contract, says he is taking one game at a time. "So far so good but we face a stern test on Saturday against Kabras but we are relishing the challenge of playing the Enterprise  Cup champions,” added Ocholla Kabras thrashed Impala 37-7 to win the Enterprise Cup in May. Ocholla, a former Nakuru and Strathmore Leos tactician said he expected a competitive league campaign with several teams challenging for top honours. “This year will be tough every team has made an improvement and we cannot underestimate any team,” noted Ocholla. Ocholla noted he was keen on improving execution in attack for and defence for his side.
