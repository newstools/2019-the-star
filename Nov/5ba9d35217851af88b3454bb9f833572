Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) will use next year's Super Series as a yardstick to select Kenya Simbas' provisional squad for Africa Cup. Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) chairman Oduor Gangla said the competition scheduled for between June and August next year, will be used to select the country's top 120 players for the Africa Cup as well as other matches.  The Super Series was last played in 2014 before the main sponsor Bamburi Cement withdrew support. Gangla exuded confidence that they will find a sponsor for the event in the due course. He said the tournament can unearth new talent and build sufficient depth for the Kenya 15's teams for the next couple of years. “ If we are to take rugby to the next level, then the Super Series will be an ideal start.  We need to get a big base of players to choose from and it will aid in our selection for the national team,” he added. Tentatively, Gangla said the tournament will feature six franchise teams but more information will be released in due course. The KRU boss also announced that Kenya Simbas coach Paul Odera will handle the Kenya team for next year's Africa Under-20 tournament which will be played in South Africa next year. The team, also known as Chipu, qualified to represent the continent at the Junior Rugby Trophy in Brazil. Half of the players who played in Brazil are expected to be part of the team and training is set to kick off next month.
