Kenya could soon join the league of countries that sustainably manage her waste following successful drafting of the National Sustainable Waste Management Bill, 2018 and e-waste strategy. The two documents address the toxic flood of electric and electronic waste believed to be growing at an alarming rate. Under the strategy, the government will convert some of the waste into a source of decent work to protect Kenyans from its harmful effects. Yesterday, the director for environmental education and awareness at the Environment Ministry Ayub Macharia said, "We successfully did a national validation meeting in April." Macharia said the two documents have gone through public participation. "We expect to cut the waste going to dumpsites," he said. The Communication Authority of Kenya says the high rate of e-waste accumulation is caused by the influx of cheap short-life products, mainly from Asia. In 2016, for example, Sh1.5 trillion worth of Chinese phones were shipped into the country. As of June 30, there were 52.2 million mobile subscribers in Kenya. The UN's Global E-waste Monitor 2017 estimates that every person in the world has at least 6.1kg of electronic waste to dispose of today. This figure is expected to grow to 6.8kg per person in 2021, enough to fill 10,510 buildings the size of Times Tower in Nairobi, which is 140m tall. Globally,  about 50 million tonnes of electronic waste is thrown away each year. Only 20 per cent is recycled, meaning 80 per cent is dumped in landfills, burned or illegally traded. E-waste health risks may result from direct contact with harmful materials such as lead, cadmium, chromium, brominated flame retardants or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), from inhalation of toxic fumes, as well as from accumulation of chemicals in soil, water and food. Macharia said 60 per cent of waste will be taken to a composting facility where they will be turned into manure. Five per cent of the waste will be incinerated and 30 per cent recycled.
