Shock gripped residents of Kambirwa village in the outskirts of Murang'a town after the mutilated body of a 50-year-old man was found dumped along the road. The body of Chege Njuguna was found dumped in a polythene bag along the Mukuyu Kambirwa road on Friday morning. His hands and legs were tied and his head mutilated, Muasya added, with some flesh missing on his face and scalp. In an incident that shocked the entire village, the assailants are said to have dumped the body at the scene using a bodaboda on Wednesday night. "There were boda boda tyre prints all around the crime scene," Muasya said. The commander termed the crime as unique saying it has not been experienced before. He noted that investigations have already been launched to establish who the victim is and where he came from. A post mortem will also be done to establish the exact cause of his death. However, residents feared that the man may have been killed by members of a cult. They expressed fears that the manner in which he was killed may indicate that his body may have been used to do something sinister. They asked the police to speed up investigations to unearth the motive behind the heinous murder.
