 Wajir county has started repairing roads and bridges that were destroyed by flash floods. The floods claimed the lives of eight people. The restoration of the destroyed roads and bridges is being undertaken in a partnership between the county and the national government. The programme will be mainly focussed in Wajir North, Wajir West and Eldas subcounties where dams and pans were also destroyed. A spot check by the Star showed repair works had already begun on the Ajawa-Bute stretch in Wajir North. During Mashujaa Day celebrations, Governor Mohamed Abdi said the county will do its best to mitigate the impacts and reduce the severity of flash floods. On Saturday, Abdi accompanied Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa in the distribution of foods and other relief aid items to flood victims at Lakoley, Baqala, Baladweyn, Dadhantalay and Basir areas in Eldas. Abdi thanked the  World Food Programme for providing aircraft that carried relief food to residents. “We continue to appeal to national government and strategic partners to support the most affected and vulnerable households with emergency needs including food, nutritional and medical supplies and water," Abdi said. He added, “My government will do everything within its reach to open up roads that have been cut off and made impassable by the stormwater, restore critical infrastructure, and provide emergency medical supplies as a stop-gap measure.” Wamalwa said the government will continue reaching out to all the victims to assist. Eldas MP Adan Keynan said leaders had agreed to carry out measures to mitigate risks by harvesting stormwaters. “We will work out solutions that will address this challenge once and for all,” Keynan said.  edited by peter obuya
