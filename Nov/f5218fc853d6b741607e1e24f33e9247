The four officers captured on camera attacking a JKUAT student on Monday have been identified, the National Police Service has confirmed. Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai, in a statement on Tuesday, said the police were interdicted. Further internal disciplinary processes will follow recommendations by the Internal Affairs Unit investigation. "Nairobi police service has said that the four officers who were caught on camera meting excessive violence on a JKUAT student have been identified and consequently interdicted from service as per police procedures," reads the statement. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i  had earlier said he had observed the events at JKUAT with profound concern, maintaining that the use of force by police is clearly outlined in the National Police Standing Orders. "I have spoken to the IG and we both agree that firm and decisive action shall be taken against any officer who used excessive force, within the next 24 hours," Matiang'i said. The officers engaged in the brutality as they sought to restore order after JKUAT students rioted and blocked the Thika Superhighway. The students had engaged Juja police in running battles for two hours, during which motorists could not pass through the town. The learners accused the law enforcers of not protecting them from criminals. They claimed that knife-wielding criminals waylaid them from 6pm and robbed them of cash, phones and laptops. The university was closed via a memo from the acting Deputy vice chancellor in charge of academic affairs. The Jomo Kenyatta Students’ Association, through president Clinton Osoro and secretary general Bruce Akach, said that criminals attacked two students a fortnight ago, leaving them with deep knife wounds. The IG warned that police action should never be punitive and should instead focus on maintenance of law and order and taking offenders to court.
