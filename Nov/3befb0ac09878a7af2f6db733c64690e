Kenya Sevens technical director cum coach Paul Feeney wants Shujaa to work on their decision making, defence and set-pieces ahead of the World Seven Series opener in Dubai and Cape Town next month. Kenya have been pitted against South Africa, England and Spain in Dubai and the New Zealand-born coach said the country must raise their intensity in certain facets of the game. "We are playing two of the top five teams and we must raise our game a notch higher. This, coupled with our decision making and defence, will help us a great deal because it gets competitive at the World Seven Series,” added Feeney. The former Auckland Blues and Stormers coach said competition for places in the squad is intense following the Olympic qualifiers where Kenya beat Uganda 31-0 in the final in Johannesburg over the weekend to book a slot in the Tokyo 2020 Summer Games. " I have a squad of 18 players in the training and some players have put their hands up during the tournament and delivered quality performances," noted Feeney. He said he is delighted to have secured qualification to the Olympics and reclaimed the Africa Sevens title. “We wanted to win the Safari Sevens and qualify for the Olympics before turning our attention on the World Series,” he added. Feeney said raising stars like Mwamba forward Mike Okello and Kenya Under-20 winger Geoffrey Okwach who played at the Safari Sevens for Morans will get their chances this season. Feeney observed that the World Sevens Series will be used as an audition for the Olympics next year in Tokyo. "All the 18 players in the squad will be given an equal chance. I believe we have enough depth to showcase our strengths and have a good series,” he noted. The team will rest for this week and will resume training next week after a gruelling 11 weeks. “I want the boys to have a rest and recharge their batteries for the next phase of our season,” noted Feeney.
