Equity Bank tackle Emyba in an epic play-off quarter-finals Game 2 match at the Nyayo Stadium this evening. The bankers had to use every trick in the book to pip a stubborn Emyba side 66-64 in the best of three seriesâ€™ opener at the same venue a week ago. Tony Mwendwa was unstoppable for Emyba in that encounter, sinking 18 points and Equity will have to figure out how best to stop him from start. Lenson Kisia, who posted 12, will have to team up with Titus Musembi and Alex Oguso to lift Equity who will miss the services of injured Faisal Aden and Kevin Kigotho. Action will be preceded with a lower division fixture that pits Kenyatta University Pirates against KDF Morans. Tomorrow, women's champions Equity Bank start title defence against number eight Tangit Sparks. Equity coach David Maina admitted he will miss the services of national team star Betty Kananu, who is injured but will rely on the fast-rising Linda Alando to excel. KPA, currently placed third play Eagle Wings in a game they start favourites. Third-placed Strathmore University Swords take on Storm while the University of Nairobi Dynamites confront Zetech University. In the lower division, Kisumu Lady Bucks host Eldonets in the lakeside town and KPA Youth are at home to Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. Riara University face Kisii University, Riara University men meet Neosasa Morans and Strathmore University take on KCA-University. The same teams face off again on Sunday in Game Two. Incase Emyba stun Equity, the two sides will meet again in a decisive Game 3.
