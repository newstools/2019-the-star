Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has hit out at Tiaty MP William Kamket who claimed Deputy President William Ruto had failed in Kibra. Kamket said Ruto was unable to plant a seed in the Kibra by-elections after Jubilee's McDonald Mariga lost to ODM's Imran Okoth. But in a swift rejoinder, Murkomen, who is also the Senate Majority Leader defended the DP saying he had done his best. The two posts attracted mixed reactions from Kenyans. The exchange came minutes after Ruto congratulated Jubilee for a good fight in the Kibra race. Bernard 'Imran' Okoth was on Friday morning announced the Kibra MP-elect by IEBC. Through a tweet, Ruto congratulated the Jubilee candidate McDonald Mariga and Jubilee's team for daring what he termed as 'Raila's bedroom'. The 'bedroom' phrase has been used by Raila and his party in describing Kibra as his stronghold. A low turnout, voter bribery claims and pockets of violence marred the hotly contested Kibra by-election. On Thursday night, Jubilee candidate Mariga conceded defeat.
