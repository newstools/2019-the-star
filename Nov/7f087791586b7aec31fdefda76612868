Bandari have given a vote of confidence to coach Bernard Mwalala despite their recent poor performances in the Kenyan Premier League. Sundays 2-0 loss at home to league leaders Gor Mahia was the coastal outfit's third defeat in four matches but club chairman Musa Hassan is not worried by the disappointing form. “I believe the technical bench is okay. We have a strong team and we will obviously turn the results around,” said Musa. “The players have been bogged down by fatigue from our matches in the Confederations Cup. We have also been unlucky in some situations. You take the game against Gor for example, we missed a penalty and the subsequent rebound. We will assess everything as a team but I still have confidence in the players and the technical bench,” added the Bandari chairman. Mwalala was recently linked with a move away from Bandari with reports suggesting that he was being considered for a job with Tanzania giants Yanga. That position has since been filled and Musa was in no doubt about his coach's loyalty. Pundits think that the mooted move could have distracted him and his players. “The technical team is just fine under his leadership. We know they have been working hard. The level of performances in our recent games against Ulinzi Stars and Western Stima confirms that we are on the right track, even if the results do not go our way,” observed Musa. “Last season, when we finished second despite losing eight matches. So far we have lost four times. The league is still there to be won as we have only played nine matches. We have to pull ourselves together and remain focused,” he concluded. The FKF Shield holders have only won twice this season with one of those victories coming without them kicking a ball after Chemelil Sugar failed to turn up for their duel in Mombasa. With nine points from as many matches, Bandari are 13th in the standings. Their next match will be away to former champions Tusker on Sunday.
