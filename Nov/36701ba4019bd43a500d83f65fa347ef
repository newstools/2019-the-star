Over 500 families have been displaced as Tiver Tana burst its banks on Monday following rains that have been pounding the area for three days. The top priority is rescuing people cut off and marooned by floods. Heavy rains are expected to continue throughout this week. Addressing the press at the Farmers Training camp where 150 families from Ziwani are camping, Kenya Red Cross northeastern region coordinator Mohamed Abdikadir said that volunteers are documented the needs of families in camps. The worst-affected areas are Bula Kamor, Bula Punda, Bakuyu and Ziwani . On Sunday night, Red Cross teams used a boat to rescue 15 people marooned by floodwaters at Hadama in Tana River. “The priority now is sanitation because without toilets and clean water there's a risk of waterborne diseases that would make the lives of these families more miserable," Abdkadir said. When the press visited the area, Red Cross volunteers were busy listing the victims to ensure only the needy are assisted. “As you know, when these situations happen some people always try to take advantage and benefit," he said. "This not only locks out deserving victims but also stretches donations, including food and non-food supplies," he said. He said that in 2017, several families pretended to be flood victims received food and non-foot items t the expense of needy people. Mororo chief Abdalla Ali said that the Red Cross and humanitarian agencies are taking too long to provide food and toilets. He urged Garissa count to swiftly connect clean piped water. "These families are desperately in need of help and it will only be good if it comes as quickly as possible,” he said. Speaking on the phone, Garissa county commissioner Mwangi Meru urged residents in flood-prone areas to move to safe grounds. Meru said that his office was working closely with donors and the county to ensure flood victims are assisted swiftly. (Edited by V. Graham)
