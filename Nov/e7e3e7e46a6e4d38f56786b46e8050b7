MPs have approved the nomination of Samuel Kobia to head the National Cohesion and Integration Commission. National Assembly Committee on National Cohesion and Equal Opportunity, chaired by nominated MP Maina Kamanda, also approved the nomination of six other nominees to serve in the Commission. Among the six approved include former MPs Philip Okundi (Rangwe) and Abdulaziz Farah (Mandera East). Others are former Nairobi County acting Finance CEC Danvas Makori, Fatuma Tabwara, Peris Nyuttu, Dorcas Kedogo and former Kerio Valley Development Authority board chairman Samuel Kona. The eight nominees were picked by President Uhuru Kenyatta to sit in the agency that fosters equal opportunity, good relations, harmony and peaceful co-existence of persons of different ethnic and racial communities and advise the government. The committee vetted the nominees on Thursday last week and was unanimous in its decision to approve all of them. The nominees now await approval by the whole House before formal appointment by the President. Before her appointment, Nyuttu was a member of the defunct National Irrigation Board board and also played a pivotal role in mobilising youths to support President Uhuru and his deputy William Rutoâ€™s re-election in 2017. She was the brains behind the popular Warembo Na UhuRuto lobby group which traversed the country campaigning for Jubilee party.
