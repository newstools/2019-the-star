Thika Town constituency is the first National Government Constituency Development Fund committee to win an award for best financial reporting. The team was awarded during the 18th edition of Financial Reporting (FiRe) Awards 2019 held on Friday night at Carnivore Restaurant in Nairobi. The NG-CDF committee won the award based on the 2018-19 fiscal year audited report. It was the only constituency that was recognised in the fete out of the 290 across the country. FiRe is the most prestigious and coveted financial reporting award in East Africa. Speaking to the press after the awards ceremony, Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina attributed the success to his resolve to delink politics from service delivery. “Beating all the 290 constituencies was a pleasant surprise that had not crossed my mind. However, it all boils down to service leadership that has been our clarion call since we assumed office. In Thika, we say ‘Hapa Kazi Tu’, I promise my constituents to wait for greater times ahead. There is no turning back,” an elated Wainaina said. He hailed his CDF committee for its dedication to serve. “Our 2018-19 CDF allocation only had Sh45 million set aside for development but the amount of work this team has done with it is enormous. How I wish our predecessors did the same. Thika town would have made very big strides in development,” he said. CDF chairman Huruko Njau said the MP has a hands-on approach to issues. Fund manager Joan Koech said, “It’s all about commitment and believing in oneself." NG-CDF board chairman Robert Masese challenged other constituencies across the country to follow suit. The FiRe Awards 2019 brought together more than a 100 participants from across East Africa, drawn from both private and public entities. Permanent Secretary Treasury and National Planning Dr. Julius Muia was the chief guest in this year’s event.
