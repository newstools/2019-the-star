Property was destroyed on Saturday night after candidates at Kenyoro Mixed Secondary in Marani, Kisii county went on strike. Window panes and doors were shattered during the incident. Equipment at the school laboratory was also damaged during the two-hour-long riots caused by drunken students. At least 100 boys suspected of participating in the strike slithered out of the school compound into the nearby maize farms when anti-riot police were deployed. They were yet to return to the school yesterday, police said. Guards at the school said about 14 boys found smoking bhang at night in the playing ground may have instigated the violence. A teacher at the school said the students were in their classes for preps when they suddenly walked out and begun rioting. He said the guards had also stumbled on the boys smoking weed in the open and it is after they confronted them that they turned unruly and begun randomly throwing stones while chanting war songs. "They were in class for their prep lessons when the boys suddenly went out into the playing field where some of them begun smoking some substance which we realized later was bhang. It was when they tried to inquire that the students rushed back to the dormitories and begun pelting stones on windows," said the teacher. All along, he said, the students have been peaceful and are yet to determine the motive of them in riots. "We are truly at a loss and being an examination period we had not seen this coming," he told the Star by phone. The riots forced police in riot gear to fire in the air to contain the situation , county police commander Martin Kibet said.
