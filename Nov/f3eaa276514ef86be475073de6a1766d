 An Anti-Corruption court has directed the defence in the Sh60 million graft case against Kipipiri MP Amos Kimunya and two others to present final submissions on January 10, next year. The prosecution closed its case after the testimony of over 10 witnesses. The case has been pending in court for six years. Kimunya, a former Finance minister is jointly charged with abuse of office alongside Lilian Njenga, a former director of Land Adjudication and Settlement, and Jughae Wainaina, the chairman of Midlands Ltd. The company is associated with the MP. The three have denied seven counts of abuse of office, failing to disclose the private interest to oneâ€™s principal and fraudulent disposal of public property worth Sh60 million in June 2005. Kimunya and Njenga are said to have allocated Midlands 25 acres of public land. The particulars of the case are that Kimunya did not protect public property and failure to disclose that he was a director of Midland. Njenga allegedly disposed of public property while Wainaina is said to have fraudulently acquired public property registered under Settlement Fund Trustee. Wainaina and Midlands are accused of fraudulent acquisition of public property on February 6, 2006, in Nairobi county. Prosecution witness Joseph Wanuma told trial magistrate Felix Kombo that farmers in Kinangop did not benefit in any way from Midlands Ltd. The Kinango Agriculture officer said he has never seen papers showing how the property was transferred from the trustee to Midlands. He did not know who the directors of Midlands were. Former Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko rejected Kimunya's plea for the matter to be settled out of court. The Nyandarua county government wanted the case settled but the prosecution said the matter was of public interest.
