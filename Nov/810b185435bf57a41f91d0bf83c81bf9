43 Nasa MCAs have appended their signatures to remove Kileleshwa MCA Elias Otieno as the Minority Leader of the Nairobi County Assembly. Otieno has a been accused of disrespecting the women leadership and supporting the ANC party candidate, Eliud Owalo, in the just concluded Kibera by-election. He has also been accused of opposing the nomination of Nairobi West MCA Maurice Gari to the County Assembly Service Board. Minority Whip Peter Imwatok confirmed receiving the petition by Kabiro MCA Clarence Munga. On receiving the petition, the Whip called for a meeting of all the Nasa MCAs in the morning where the MCAs signed the petition in the presence of Otieno. A letter regarding the removal of the Minority Leader accompanied with the signatures has been sent to ODM Party Leader Raila Odinga and the Secretary General Edwin Sifuna. The ouster comes days after the Jubilee Party made its own changes in the Nairobi County Assembly leadership in a bid to end the ongoing wrangles. Dandora Three MCA Charles Thuo was appointed the new Majority Leader replacing Matopeni MCA Abdi Hassan Guyo. Kariokor MCA Millicent Mugadi took over from James Kiriba (Riruta) as the deputy Majority leader. Nominated MCA June Ndegwa was appointed the new Majority Whip. The seat was occupied by South B MCA Waithera Chege. Ndegwa is now deputised by California Ward rep Hassan Abdikadir. In a letter addressed to County Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi, Jubilee secretary general Raphel Tuju said that the changes were to bring sanity in the house.
