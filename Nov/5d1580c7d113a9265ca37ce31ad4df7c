AFC Leopards' coach Andre Mbungo is back to the drawing board as he seeks to beef up ahead of the January transfer window. The move is as a result of the 4-1 drubbing at the hands of arch-rivals during the last weekend's Mashemeji Derby' at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Ingwe last caged Gor in 2016 through Lamine Dialo's solitary goal. With Ingwe set to face Gor again on March 15 next year, Mbungo has outlined his plans to beef up and end a three-year jinx against their rivals. “The transfer window will be opened from January 1 to 31 to allow clubs strengthen their squads,” revealed KPL Chief Executive Officer Jack Oguda. Mbungo, who has lost all the three derbies he has overseen since taking over the reigns in February, said the gulf of class between his side and Gor would only be covered by signing experienced players. He cited Gor's back-to-back participation in continental football as an advantage in the league matches hence their dominance. “We have to sign experienced players for us to beat Gor in the return leg. We played well against them in the first half but used the exposure gained in continental football to punish us in the second. That will only be addressed if we bring in players in all departments. They are beatable,” he noted. In the meantime, the 51-year-old Rwandese coach exuded confidence that besides breaking the derby jinx, the 21 years trophy drought in the league will be confined to history books if their good start this season is anything to go by.  Leopards last won the league in 1998 and currently sit seven with 15 points, three shy of Gor. "The league title is within our reach despite the heavy defeat. Before the loss, we had good returns from the previous eight rounds. The advantage we have is that we can build on the good start to give the title a spirited onslaught. We are only a paltry three points off the apex which means if they fall and we win, we will go top,”
