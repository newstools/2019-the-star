The raging floods and landslides witnessed in West Pokot should be pegged on weather-pattern dynamics currently cutting across the globe; not the Meteorological department. The warming effects experienced across the world have the basis for the volatility. Lack of proper soil cover is a major setback that could have shelved the landslide. Public awareness should be raised on the importance of planting trees to curb tragedies. The public ought to appreciate the fact that the Met has no full control of the weather as predictions are not always right.  Nairobi
