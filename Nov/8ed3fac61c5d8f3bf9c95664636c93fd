Kenyan producer Magix Enga says he has forgiven Harmonize. The Dundaing hitmaker had Harmonize’s song Uno pulled down from YouTube after he accused the Tanzanian of breach of copyright. Harmonize on the other hand wrote on social media, “Challenges will never kill you. It’s just making you stronger. Take it from me. Thanks to my Management Konde gang and everyone who supports me.  My People, I’m happy to tell you that our number one song is back again louder on Youtube”
