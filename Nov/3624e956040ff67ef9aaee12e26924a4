Popular news presenter Waihiga Mwaura is set to take Hussein Mohammed's seat as new host for Citizen TV News. Waihiga was in the past a sports news presenter and recently a co-host alongside Mashirima Kapombe and Trevor Ombija on a Monday news segment. In 2018, Waihiga won BBC news World News Komla Dumor award. He takes over the Tuesday night segment which has been characterized by Hussein's steamy interviews. Hussein had been reading prime time news every Tuesday and has also conducted high profile interviews. In his final show, he hosted Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen and National Assembly Minority Leader John Mbadi. Earlier this month, Hussein announced his exit from the media house having worked with the company for 10 years. Politicians from across the divide paid tribute to Hussein as he exited the station after a long time. Announcing his exit, he tweeted, "It has been a wonderful 10 years at Citizen TV. I have enjoyed & relished every moment I shared with my colleagues at RMS. I have decided to take a break after October In Sha Allah to concentrate on other matters. Loved the fans, the critics & everything in between. See you soon."
