Comedian Daniel Ndambuki, aka Churchill, brought Nairobi to a standstill last Friday at the Ruach Festival, Sarit Expo. He told Word Is yesterday, “The event was refreshing, restoring. I am so glad and lucky to have been part of that amazing event. “I wish it could happen every other day. I needed it and I’m sure those who came there were totally blessed and it must have made a lot of difference in their lives.” The event, whose theme was ‘To restore, rebuild and revive’ was attended by top comedians among them Uganda’s Salvado, Kenya’s MC Jessy, Sleepy David, MCA Tricky, Otos and Dr Ofweneke. Gospel singer Guardian Angel was the artiste of the night. According to the festival’s website, “The R movement endeavors to begin a conscious driven drawn up agenda that will require every members’ participation over the next 20 years, & with an eagle eye focus on the endgame.” Churchill spoke about his struggles before fame. “I used to work in Industrial Area washing bottles and I would be paid peanuts. The money wasn’t enough for food and transport. Things were not easy back then,” he said Other speakers of the event were Bishop JB Masinde, Bishop Fed Idahosa,Apostle Joshua Selman, Pastor Edwin Biayebo and Rev Julian Kyula.
