The National Police Service Commission has named three of the four officers interdicted for brutalising JKUAT protesters. Corporal George Wathania, constables Jonathan Kibet and Boniface Muthama were captured on camera beating the students protesting against insecurity in the area. NPSC chairperson Eliud Kinuthia on Wednesday said the fourth officer was yet to be identified since the video is unclear. “The clip is not very clear so the fourth officer cannot be identified,” said Kinuthia. When taken to task to explain how an unidentified police officer was interdicted, Kinuthia said there was a misunderstanding and that the name of the fourth officer had not been handed over to them yet. “We are yet to receive the name of the fourth officer,” he said. The chairperson also assured the public that action will be taken against the police officers after investigations are complete. Earlier on, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) said at least 22 students from JKUAT were seriously injured by police during protests on Monday. The authority on Tuesday said it identified all the 50 police officers who were involved in the operation. Chairperson Anne Makori in a statement to newsrooms said based on the preliminary findings, the authority would advance the matter into a full independent investigation. She said that the four police officers who were captured on video brutalising one of the students have all been interdicted.
