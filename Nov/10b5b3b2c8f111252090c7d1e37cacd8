A witness on Wednesday told the court how five employees of Family Bank and a security guard stole more than Sh19.2 million after breaking into the bank in Ruiru. John Kingori Muchiri, who works at the bank's head office as head of security, told senior principal magistrate Stellah Atambo that during breaking into the bank, the ATM lost more money. He was testifying in a case against supervisor Cyrus Mugo, tellers Nancy Njeri and Sally Mureithi, Francis Lucigi Shego, Michael Rapando Malobo and guard Robert Ndururi. They have denied stealing the money. The prosecution alleges that all the accused persons jointly broke into the bank's Ruiru branch and stole Sh19,204,563, 210 and $570 (Sh64,037) on the night of July 14 and 15. The guard alone also faces a second count of failing to prevent the offence despite being assigned to guard the bank as back-up security. Muchiri recalled that he was at home when he received a call from Mugo who informed him that unknown people had broken into the bank and robbed it. He said he rushed to the bank and reported to Ruiru police station. When police officers arrived, he said, they all entered the bank to conduct investigations. He told the court that the investigations linked all the accused persons to the offence. He identified them as bank employees and a night guard. The court heard that Radar Security firm guards normally patrol from the bank outside and are custodians of the keys to the parking yard. During cross-examination by defence lawyers, Muchiri denied claims that the bank bribed investigators to write a favourable probe report to prefer criminal charges against the accused persons. The defence had produced a voucher of Sh10,000 which they said the bank had paid investigators during the probe. But Mugo said he is the one who requested the money to buy lunch for a team of investigators and himself. "We did not share the money, I bought lunch for the team," he said. Edited by R.Wamochie
