The Jubilee Party has made changes in its Nairobi assembly leadership in a bid to end ongoing wrangles. Dandora Three MCA Charles Thuo is the new Majority leader. He replaces Matopeni MCA  Abdi Hassan Guyo. Kariokor MCA Millicent Mugadi takes over from James Kiriba (Riruta) as the deputy Majority leader. Nominated MCA June Ndegwa is the new Majority whip. The seat was occupied by South B MCA Waithera Chege. Ndegwa will be deputised by California Ward rep Hassan Abdikadir. In a letter addressed to County Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi yesterday, Jubilee secretary general Raphel Tuju said that the changes were to bring sanity in the house. The move comes as a day after chaos was witnessed in the assembly over the occupancy of the offices. Tuju said that the party did not wish to interfere with the affairs of the MCAs unless it was absolutely necessary. He cited Standing Order number 20 which requires the party to designate the Majority leadership in the assembly. “It is unfortunate that some of the conflicting MCAs participated in a chaotic situation on the assembly before we could resolve it. In order to bring clarity on the issue of leadership in the house, we have decided to respect the list as brought to you by Hon. June Ndegwa,” the letter reads. In the letter, Tuju said that the party had received letters from both the conflicting parties and have set a date to resolve the squabbles. “We expect that the disputing parties will respect the [dispute resolution] process and not take matters into their own hands,” Tuju said. In addition to the changes, Speaker Elachi who chairs the County Assembly Service Board also communicated that Monica Muthama is the acting clerk. Former assembly clerk Jacob Ngwele was last month sent on a one-month compulsory leave and last week had his name revoked on the floor of the house.
