Three men from Makueni have been sentenced to life imprisonment for defilement. Lamu principal magistrate Allan Sitati Temba, sitting in Makindu law court in Makueni county on Monday, found Peter Mutuku, James Nduwa and Summy Nzomo guilty of the offences committed between February and June this year in Kibwezi subcounty. Mutuku was charged with defiling a seven-year-old girl in Masongaleni in February. Nduwa was charged with defiling an eight-year-old girl at Bondeni estate in Kibwezi town in April. Nzomo will also spend life behind bars for defiling a one-and-a-half year old girl in Nzambani in Kibwezi. While delivering his ruling, Temba said the accused had caused long-life trauma to the minors. He said the sentence would serve as a lesson to deter others from committing related crimes. “I'm satisfied that the evidence adduced in court by the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime and deserves a life sentence,” the visiting magistrate said. Temba and two others have been sitting in Makindu court to assist in disposing of sexual offence cases that have been piling up in court since 2014. His colleagues are Charles Mayamba (Kilungu) and Edward Too (Mandera) Makueni county is reportedly one of the counties with rampant cases of sexual offences
