Mwingi residents still use Dola maize flour, despite the warning issued by Kebs that its aflatoxin levels are high. Following surveillance and testing, it was established that the level of aflatoxin in Dola, Kifaru, Starehe, 210 and Jembe maize flour had exceeded the amount allowed by the Kenya Bureau of Standards. Across Mwingi, however, traders still sell the products, especially Dola, which has one of its manufacturing plants in the area. Many supermarket shelves are stocked with Dola maize and wheat flour. Customers have ignored the health risks raised by the authorities. On Monday, Kasyoka Musyimi defended Dola, saying she has been using it and nothing harmful has happened to her or any member of her family. “For the years I've cooked using this maize flour, I've noted nothing harmful,” she said. Wholesaler Fazul Mwangi said he was shocked to hear the flour was poisonous despite having been in the market for many years. “My customers have not been complaining about this particular flour,” he said. Ali, who is the head of sales for Eldoret Grains Limited Company in Mwingi, said Dola maize flour is processed, packaged and branded differently by two companies. He said their firm maintains maximum quality standards. “At Eldoret Grains LTD company, we have ensured we meet all quality standards,” Ali said, disputing claims that Dola had high levels of aflatoxin. He said the brand whose quality standards have been questioned might be the one processed by Kitui Flour Mills. He urged consumers to continue using the product made by the Eldoret Grains Limited.
