Ibrahim Kibet and Kevin Cheruiyot hope to bounce back in the second futures tournament in Maputo after a mixed performance in the first event. Cheruiyot, who is seeded seventh in the tournament, lost 6-2, 6-0 in the first round to India's Taha Kapadia while Kibet put up a gallant fight in his second-round match against South Africa's Dylan Saton before going down 6-3, 6-4. Both players are using the tournament as a build-up or the Davis Cup qualifier against Indonesia in March next year. Kibet said he has learnt his lessons from the last defeat and he hopes to make an improvement. “It's not what I had prepared for and therefore I will take extra training sessions and prepare well for the next week's event," added Kibet. Cheruiyot said he will have to adapt to the slow surface on the Murray court in Maputo.  “It's taken a while to adjust to the surface but we will have extended training sessions to get used to it and I am confident come the next tournament, I will play better,” added Cheruiyot. Kenya's top-ranked player Ishmael Changawa missed the event due to a nagging shoulder injury while Albert Njogu is sitting his KCSE examinations.
