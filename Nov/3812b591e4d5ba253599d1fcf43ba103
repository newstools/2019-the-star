Three years after the last general elections, politicians are still politicking with the “mtu wetu” notion. Children are born with a clean mind that we taint with stories and pictures of other tribes as unequal and inferior to ours. The vice will rub onto our children who are the future of the nation. Although the future generation should understand their cultural roots, they should also observe how cultural diversity makes the country beautiful. Ethnic stereotyping leaves an image on the minds of children; images that later on fuel ethnic wars. Every ethnic group is unique and children should not only be taught this but also guided by example to embrace the uniqueness of every ethnic tribe. They should be taught that before we become tribes, we are Kenyans first.  Nakuru
