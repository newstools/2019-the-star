The National Transport and Safety Authority on Thursday launched the smart driving license office in Garissa town that will also serve Wajir and Mandera. It is a huge relief for drivers from Northeastern region who have been traveling over 375km to Nairobi to acquire the new document. Addressing the press after launch on Thursday, head of licensing Hared Adan said applicants will receive their smart driving license within 72 hours upon registering and booking with NTSA online. Drivers holding the old driving license and want to replace it will pay a fee of Sh3,050. Hared advised drivers in need of the services to visit their new officers located at the old police inspection yard in Garissa town. Other service the office offers include issuance of road service licenses, PSV badges and log book transfers. Hared said unlike before, the interim license will no longer be issued to those who have completed driving school. They will be enrolled and given smart driving licenses after passing the tests. Garissa county roads CEC Abdi Farah urged the NTSA to open similar offices in Wajir and Mandera towns, which are still far from Garissa. Farah said it will still be expensive for applicants in Mandera, which is over 700km from Garissa, and those in Wajir, slightly over 300km away. “The whole idea of opening new government offices is to bring services closer to the people and save them the costs they incur in accessing the services and time,” Farah said. Matatu sacco chairman Ahmed Dahir regretted that many of their members had fallen prey to cartels who ended up conning them under the pretext that they would assist them acquire driving licenses and other related services.
