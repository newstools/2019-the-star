 Zoo Kericho coach Herman Iswekha has challenged his charges to build on their surprise victory over Kariobangi Sharks yesterday as they seek a way out of the dreaded relegation zone. The 1-0 win over Sharks was only Zoo’s second in eight matches and was crucial to helping them increase their gap with the bottom three to a respectable three points. “We played a very cohesive match against a tough opponent. I believe we deserved the three points. Now the challenge is to ensure we maintain this level of performances on a regular basis,” Iswekha said after the match at Afraha Stadium. Defender Norman Werunga scored the all-important goal five minutes to halftime to consign Sharks to their third defeat of the nascent campaign. Like Zoo, Sharks have seven points from eight matches and are in real danger of being drawn into a relegation dogfight as the campaign progresses. Meanwhile, Tusker are in control of the Premier League standings after edging hard-fighting Nzoia United 3-2 thanks to a double from Timothy Otieno and a second half strike from Mike Madoya on Saturday. The brewers have 16 points, one ahead of both the champions, Gor Mahia and their bitter rivals AFC Leopards. Gor, however, have played three matches fewer due to their commitment in the CAF Continental Cup. Leopards missed the opportunity to go top following their goalless draw with Ulinzi Stars. Chemelil Sugar remain bottom of the table despite picking their first point of the season in a 1-1 stalemate with another winless side, Kisumu All Stars.
