 A primary school deputy headteacher has denied attempting to lynch a Standard Seven pupil over alleged theft. John Munene was jointly charged in a Siakago court with Lewis Gichoni, Patrick Njiru, Joseph Ndwiga and Joseph Kariuki. They are said to have assaulted the pupil at Kanyweri village in Embu County on March 4. They accused the boy of stealing undisclosed items. Senior resident magistrate Jackson Omwange released the accused on Sh10,000 bail each and ordered the prosecution to provide them with copies of the charge sheet and any other relevant document. Munene's lawyer Njeru Ithiga had, in his application for bond, told the court that the charge was bailable. Prosecutor Margaret Muraguri said she will call six witnesses when the hearing starts on March 11, next year.
