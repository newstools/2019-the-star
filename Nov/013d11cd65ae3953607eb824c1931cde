The Orange Democratic Movement has appointed Karen MCA David Mberi as the new Minority Leader in the Nairobi County Assembly. Mberia replaces  Kileleshwa MCA Elias Otieno, who was on Thursday voted out by 40 out of 55 MCAs by signing a petition to remove him. The changes come three days after Jubilee Party temporarily made changes to its leadership in the assembly. ODM Executive Director Oduor Ong’wen made the communication in a letter dated November 15, 2019, addressed to Speaker Beatrice Elachi. “Kindly accord him the necessary Cooperation, facilities and privileges necessary for the optimal functioning of his office,” reads the letter. The letter was copied to ODM Nairobi county chairman George Aladwa, Clerk of the County Assembly and Chief Whip Peter Imwatok. Mberia is serving his second term as the ward rep for Karen Ward. The minority leadership now consist of Mberia as the Minority leader deputised by Hospital Ward MCA Patrcik Musili. Makongeni MCA Peter Imwatok serves as the Minority Chief Whip deputised by Kilimani MCA Moses Ogeto. Elias has been serving in that seat since 2013 until his removal on Thursday. Kabiro MCA Clarence Munga on Thursday presented the petition to have Otieno removed. As required by law, Minority Chief Whip Peter Imwatok called members to a meeting where those in agreement signed the petition. Otieno was accused of many issues including poor leadership and defying the party's position regarding its stand on the return of Elachi as the Speaker of the assembly. According to the petition, Otieno was also accused of supporting Amani National Congress candidate Eliud Owalo in the the just concluded Kibra elections. He also opposed the nomination of Maurice Gari, who replaced him to sit in the County Assembly Service Board.
