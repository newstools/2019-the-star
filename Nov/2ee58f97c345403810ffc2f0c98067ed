Like any other artiste, Khaligraph Jones, aka The OG, was no stranger to being booed on stage by fans when he was an upcoming artiste. He shared a photo on Instagram yesterday and wrote, "This is around 2012, The Night I was Booed off stage cause The crowd didnâ€™t believe that a Kenyan Rapper could rap so Good, They thought I was performing Eminem and Jay-z Songs, The OG shall be respected." Previously, the rapper said he had done over 200 songs before he made his very first hit.
