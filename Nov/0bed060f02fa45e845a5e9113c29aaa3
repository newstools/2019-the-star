Homeboyz face a daunting task when they make the short trip to Ruaraka to face champions KCB in the highlight of the Kenya Cup action today. Both sides have had an impressive start to the season, winning all their four matches thus far to sit second and third on the log respectively. The bankers have 20 points having won all matches with bonus points and will start the match as marginal favourites, having lost just once to the Deejays in 15 Kenya cup meetings.  The Deejays have 18 points. The bankers will be without skipper Curtis Lilako, who picked a knock while fullback Isaac Njoroge will be rested. Oliver Mangeni starts in place of Martin Owilah with Levi Amunga coming in for Njoroge. Homeboyz, on their part, will start with Kenya Sevens stars Bush Mwale and Alvin Otieno on the wing as Henry Ayah starts at flyhalf and Michael Wanjala at fullback. Thomas Okidia, Bruce Shihemi and Meshack Akenga start in the front row. League leaders Kabras welcome Blak Blad at the Kakamega Showground hoping to record their fifth win of the season ahead of a title defining fixture against KCB next week. Winless Quins are at home to Menengai Oilers. Gibson Weru’s charges will be hoping to inflict more pain on the Ngong road outfit. Oilers beat Quins 14-8 last season and drew 22-22 at the RFUEA ground in the reverse fixture. Mwamba host Nondies at the Railway Club as Impala make the long trip to the lakeside to take on newbies Kisumu RFC.
