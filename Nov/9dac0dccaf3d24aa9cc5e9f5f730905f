A hearing of a case in which an Uber driver was charged with careless driving that caused serious injuries to a Kenyan musician began on Monday. While testifying before Milimani chief traffic magistrate Erecota Riany, Tony Muguna a Kenyan musician told the court that he sustained serious face, shoulder and neck injuries. "The injuries sustained affected my shoulder and I cannot work normally," Muguna said. Rony Mwenda Marete, an uber driver was charged early this month for careless driving by allegedly talking to the phone and driving with one hand despite heavy rains on the day of the accident. While defending himself, Mwenda informed the trial court that on a fateful night, he was down with asthma thus he had to rush for his inhaler. "I was unwell and I had to hurry to save my life," Mwenda said. The musician on his part denied Mwenda's allegation saying that he was not informed of his health condition. According to court papers, on October 31 at about midnight along Kenyatta Avenue Mwenda drove a Suzuki alto without due care and attention to other road users. He is said to have failed to keep his lane and hit on the near right side of a government motor vehicle, an NYS bus thus causing injuries to Muguna. The NYS driver, Kirisiet Ole Mchoe also told the court that indeed Mwenda was speeding and unable to control his vehicle causing a tyre burst after hitting a concrete barrier. The hearing will continue on Tuesday at the Milimani court.
