The mutilated body of a woman who has been missing for a week was found in Gitare Forest, Gilgil, on Monday. Ann Nyambura went missing in unclear circumstances. Her body was found by herders who reported to the police. Her right hand had been chopped off at the wrist and one side of her head crushed with a blunt object. Police have launched a manhunt for a man who was last seen with her in the village located 20km from Gilgil town. He is said to have been her lover. Witness Amos Wainaina said Nyambura was well known in the village and her disappearance had left residents in fear. He said her relatives and friends had searched in various hospitals and mortuaries before herders stumbled on her body. “Whoever killed her tried to cover the body using bushes in the nearby thicket but this was exposed by grazing livestock,” he said. Gilgil OCPD Emmanuel Opuru confirmed the recovery of the body adding that it had been collected and taken to Gilgil Mortuary. He said initial investigations pointed to murder adding that an inquest file had been opened. “The woman was reported as missing on November 20,” he said. Meanwhile, a two-year-old fell and drowned in a pond in Naivasha as the effects of the ongoing rains continue to be felt. The minor allegedly slipped into the pond in Maraigushu village while his parents were working on the farm and his body was discovered minutes later. Village elder Samuel Gitahi said the area had recorded heavy rains in the last week flooding pans and seasonal rivers. “The rains have, however, come with bad luck as already we have lost one minor and several personal effects have been washed away,” he said.
