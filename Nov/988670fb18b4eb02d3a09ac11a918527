Deputy President William Ruto on Monday Landed in Kapenguria, West Pokot to assess the situation after a landslide claimed 52 lives. Ruto went to condole with the families affected by the landslide at the Kapenguria District Hospital. His arrival comes hours after a military chopper carrying Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and his Devolution counterpart Eugene Wamalwa was  forced to land in Eldoret due to bad weather. Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, who accompanied Ruto, criticised Matiang'i and his team for failing to make the trip. "We are Kapenguria to see victims of landslide. Weather not good for Matiangi’s chopper," Murkoment posted on Twitter. He added that Matiang'i and team were focused on planning for the BBI report launch instead of attending to the West Pokot residents. The cabinet secretaries were accompanied by the Police Inspector General Hillary Mutyambai. "We have been forced to land in Eldoret. We were on our way to Kapenguria Referral Hospital to meet leaders and victims of the landslide in West Pokot. We left Nairobi at 8:30 in the morning. The weather is very bad. We do not want to defy the advisory that we are getting from the pilot and the experts we are with," Matiang'i said. The CS said they will wait to see if the weather will improve before they embark on their journey. He added that the government is committed to addressing the challenges of West Pokot residents. Matiang'i said the government has so far dispatched relief food, mattresses and blankets to the affected families. Wamalwa said that the government is working around the clock to ensure maximum support is given to all the affected families. Rift Valley Regional Coordinator George Natembeya accompanied the team.
