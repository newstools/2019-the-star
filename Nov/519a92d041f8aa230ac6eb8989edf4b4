Motorists using the Southern bypass will now be forced to use alternative routes to commute for four days. Kenya Urban Roads Authority-KURA,  has announced that a section of the dual carriageway of Southern bypass at Lang'ata NHC Flyover will be closed on November 9 to 12. "The closure is to enable installation of beams on the ongoing construction of Langata- Ngong link," KURA  Director General Silas Kinoti said in a notice on Wednesday. Kinoti said the sections will be closed from 12pm to 6am each day. "Motorists heading to Western and Mombasa Road will use service lanes as directed by traffic marshals,"he said. Kinoti asked Kenyans for cooperation and understanding. The 28.6 kilometer Nairobi Southern by-pass was  constructed at a cost of 18 billion to help decongest Nairobi.
