KPA MD Daniel Manduku moved to the High Court on Thursday to stop his impending arrest. Manduku wants the court to issue anticipatory orders which will protect him against arrest. The MD has been under investigation over procurement irregularities. On Wednesday, Manduku spent the better part of his day at the DCI headquarters where he was questioned. In the court documents, Manduku cites interference of the investigations. He said the office of the DCI has overstepped its mandate by investigating matters which should be investigated by the EACC. He said this is outside its mandate and therefore the investigations were unlawful and illegal. The matter was filed under certificate of urgency. Judge Erick Ogola directed the petition be heard er December 2. Last week, the Kenya Ports Authority suspended all new procurement "with immediate effect". The announcement came in the wake of an ongoing probe by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations of an alleged Sh2.7 billion tender scam. Last Friday, board chairman Joseph Kibwana said KPA officers have on several occasions been called upon "to shed light on various aspects of matters raised," which they have complied.
