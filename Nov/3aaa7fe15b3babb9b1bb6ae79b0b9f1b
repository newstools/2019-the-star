Coast regional commissioner John Elungata banned charcoal burning in Boni Forest and the Lamu-Somalia border, saying proceeds from the trade could be supporting al Shabaab terrorists. Elungata directed Kenya Forest Service officers enforce the ban and ensure no trade takes place. Speaking when he toured the Boni forest on Friday, Elungata said some people posing as charcoal burnings could be al Shabaabor sympathisers planning attacks in the region. He said the trade is dangerous and must stop immediately. Elungata also said charcoal burning at the Coast has been increasing, causing environmental degradation. A national logging ban is in force in most areas but charcoal burning continues, though some counties have banned it. The commission e appealed to all stakeholders in the environment sector, government officers and activists to fight illegal charcoal rade. “Charcoal burning is extremely dangerous. We know profits from the trade help terrorists. You might think someone is just burning charcoal but they are actually working with them [terrorists] or are planning something dangerous. We don’t want people burning charcoal in forests or anywhere else," Elungata sad. The ban was rejected by Lamu East MP Athman Shariff who defended charcoal burners saying they only do it for subsistence use and not commerce. The MP also asked the government to explain clearly how the ban will be enforced as it might be misused by security officers and used to frustrate residents. Athman wants residents in Boni forest to be allowed to continue charcoal burning as it has become their source of livelihood, they have been banned from entering Boni Forest, where they normally would normally hunt and gather food and water. Militants from al Shabaab use Boni forest as a hideout though security forces have flushed them out of some areas or forced them back into Somalia. (Edited by V. Graham)
