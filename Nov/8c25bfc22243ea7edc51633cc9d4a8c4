Many marital problems would be avoided or cured if couples had more sex, Pastor Susan Munene has said. Couples need to create time for sex, she said. “No couple should have an excuse for not having sex. Create time, even if it means pouring rice outside for your children to collect one by one as you do it if your house is small,” Susan said. The woman of the cloth shot into the limelight on Monday after a video of her giving marital advice went viral. In the video, Susan encourages her audience to have sex frequently. “Sex is the only game that God created, think about it. Football, rugby, netball, are all man-made,” she said. Speaking from her own experience, the pastor says she and her husband get intimate everywhere, including in the car and in the kitchen. “Kama kuna kitu inatufanya tukue kitu kimoja na pastor ni sex. Us we can have sex anywhere. Kwa gari…Twa twa. Kitchen...Twa twa. Everywhere,” she adds. Speaking to Word Is on Wednesday Susan, who is also a marriage counsellor together with her husband, said they are passionate about spreading the message to couples. “We make sure we talk to couples about sex because that is what we are tasked and if we don’t, they will not be happy," she said. "My husband and I are very serious when it comes to bed matters because we know the importance.” The couple has been together for almost two decades. “There is a lot of fear about sex because few [people] talk about it. We came to realise that and so our gift is healing all ailing marriages. We are addicted to talking about sexual intimacy. Sex is what has kept us together,” she said. Susan said they started talking to their children about sex when they were five years old. “Sex is not for unmarried for people. We strongly condemn it in children, teenagers and adults who are not married,” she said. Pastor Susan ministers at Overcomers Ministries in Kasarani.
