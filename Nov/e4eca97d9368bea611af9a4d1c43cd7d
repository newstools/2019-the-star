Tanzanian singer Rayvanny’s baby mama accused him of having a fling with a video vixen, a claim the artist denied. The Kwetu hitmaker shared a screenshot of his conversation with Fahima and wrote; “Nimekua nakuheshimu miaka yote tuliokua pamoja kuna mengi tumekoseana na tumesameheana na most of the time umekua ukitamani maisha ambayo kila siku nakwambia hayatakusaidia. "Nakuheshimu na naiheshimu sana familia yangu. Ikiwa umeamua mwenyewe kuondoa I won’t blame you. Still love my family. Nakutakia maisha mema.” In the text screenshots, Fahima told the singer to consider their child dead to him. The two are back together with Fahima calling the spat a “normal thing”.
