Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi and Meru county Commissioner Allan Machari on Friday sharply differed on the National Police disarmament and security lapses in county. Machari maintained that the disarmed reservists will not be given back their rifles to help fight against bandits until the ongoing vetting and final orders from Interior ministry are given. Machari said the ministry has deployed extra security officers along volatile borders where bandits frequently launch attacks, stealing livestock and at other times killing Meru herders. “All NPR officers were disarmed and vetting is going on. When finished we will know the way forward. We have not kept quiet. We have increased officers on our Northern parts bordering Isiolo and at the border with Tharaka Nithi to secure and repulse imminent attacks,” Machari said at Timau Stadium in Buuri, Meru, during the official Launch of the County Action Plan of Countering Extremist violence. “They were trained at Manyani. Why should the security apparatus return their riffles for them to protect our community,” Kiraitu said. Kiraitu said the reservists can’t undergo a thorough training and remain docile while attacks are being launched in some parts of the county. Kiraitu and Machari however appealed to Meru residents to avail crucial, timely and accurate information on any incidents posing danger to the community. In the last one month period, three people were killed in Meru in retaliatory attacks by bandits. Trade CS Peter Munya’s relative Akindoo M’Imathiu was shot dead at Lanyiru in Tigania East, Meru. He was tethering his goats in their shed when the attackers shot him dead and stole more than 100 goats. Peter Loolo was also shot dead at Ntangilia in Tigania East by attackers who are said to have brought their camels to Meru for pasture. Loolo, 60, was walking from his farm towards his home when he was sprayed with bullets. He died on arrival at Miathene Subcounty Hospital.
