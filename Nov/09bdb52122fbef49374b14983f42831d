KCPE results were on Monday released at the KNEC headquarters with the top student getting 440 marks. Three students tied at 439 marks with one of them being June Cheptoo Koech from Sang'alo Central Primary School in Nandi county. Cheptoo said she didn't expect to be the second best student in the country. "I feel great. I didn't expect it to happen. When I heard that the first guy had 440 marks I expected to have 420 because in school I had a rival... so I said if the first guy had 440 maybe he will have 436 and maybe I'd have 430 0r 432," Cheptoo said. When asked what she'd like to be she said, "A journalist and an actress. But it depends with the school." Cheptoo's father, Jonathan Komen, said that he noticed his daughter took an interest in reading, so he bought her a lot of books. "She has told me she wants to be a journalist just like her father," Cheptoo's father said. Komen said he was proud of his daughter's achievements. "It takes a lot of investment, taking her to a good school and buying books. I thought maybe she'll be in top 20, but now I'm grateful she's position two," he added. Education CS George Magoha said all class eight pupils will be placed in high school​ by December 2. Placement of candidates will start on Tuesday to December 2. Speaking during the release of KCPE marks at the KNEC headquarters on Monday, he assured parents of 100 per cent transition to high school. "I assure all candidates that by December they will know which schools they will go to," he said. The CS said the selection will be fair, transparent and fast. "Parents will have enough time to prepare their children for high school re-entry. They won't spend all the money on food during Christmas," he said. He further said 9000 scholarships will be awarded to candidates, with 30 per cent awarded to candidates from slums in inner major cities.
