The Bishop-elect of the Eldoret Catholic Diocese, the Reverend Dominic Kimengich, will be consecrated next year to replace the Bishop Cornelius Korir. The ceremony will be held in February more than a year since Korir's death. A letter signed by the Diocese Apostolic Administrator Maurice Anthony Crowley confirmed the installation date. “The New Bishop of Eldoret will be installed on  February 1,” the letter reads. Crawley, who is the bishop of Kitale, was appointed as acting head of the Eldoret Diocese after Korir's death on October 30, 2017. The diocese has been without a substantive bishop since that time. The installation will held at the Sacred Heart of Jesus Cathedral in Eldoret. Bishop Kimengich, 58, who previously was Bishop of Lodwar was named by Pope Francis two weeks ago The letter of his appointment was sent to the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops by the Apostolic Nuncio to Kenya Archbishop Bert van Megen. “We are pleased that we now have a new bishop and I am proud to continue working with the faithful in Eldoret as we prepare to instal the new bishop,” Crawley said. The Pope willname another bishop to replace Kimengich in Lodwar. Korir is remembered for his role in peace, reconciliation and also the fight for human rights and justice mostly in the Rift Valley region. Edited by R.Wamochie
