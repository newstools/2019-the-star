Kiambu residents have been urged to take advantage of the annual legal awareness week that started yesterday to get for free advice. Advocates practising at Kiambu law courts will offer free legal services during the event organised by the Law Society of Kenya. “The residents mostly wanted help in succession matters and civil matters which are common here in Kiambu law courts and also some people wanted to be helped on criminal matters,” Lawyer Kimani Wakimaa said. Yesterday, lawyers advised residents on how to tackle gender violence matters through the court system. “Most people do not know what to do when it comes to gender-based violence.  We took them through what to do and get justice,” Bernard Kimani said. Beth Wangui, a resident, said that due to a lack of information she had believed a case which she is a complainant had ended only to find out that the case was slated for next month. According to the lawyers, people fear to ask for help and that is why the legal awareness week is put for people to interact with them. “We hope to hold another awareness week before the year-end so that we serve our people for free as other times one is expected to pay for the legal service,” Kimani said.
