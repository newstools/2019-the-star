Tanzanian singer Lava Lava says a Kenyan man followed him to his hotel in Mombasa and accused him of seducing his wife. He told Willy M Tuva, “I was shooting our video with Susumila and I was followed by a person with a gun to my hotel room. He said that I was talking to his wife. “Susumila’s manager helped me get out of the situation because I wasn’t the one that was linked to his wife. “The guy thought I was the one destroying his marriage” The Bora Tuachane hitmaker also exposed a fake promoter who is lying about a Kakamega show this December “I was sent a poster showing that I will have a show in Kakamega but I don’t have any idea about it. There is nothing like that, I don’t have a show there,” he said.
