Leading rapper Khaligraph Jones says he has embraced the art of saying things without fear. Talking to Word Is on Wednesday at Club Milan, the Mazishi hitmaker said, "In my new song 'Mi Siogopi', I was not throwing shade at anybody. The thing with me is that if I have something to say, I'm not going to sugarcoat, I'm gonna say it straight up. So I was not throwing shade, I said it the way it was supposed to be said to whomever the shoe fits." Talking about the criteria he used to choose the rappers on his Khali Cartel 3, he said, "It's something I do. I scout for talent. Sometimes, it takes me two or three years to put something like that together. I do my research. As we speak, I know who will be on Khali Cartel 5. I see them, but they don't know." He says he has gone through struggles that have strengthened him as a rapper. "It was an alien crowd that didn't know me. I got onto the stage and started rapping and when you listen to me the first time, you'd think there is no way a Kenyan rapper can do that. They chased me away and insulted me," he said. "Sometimes, you have to go through such experiences to have a story to tell people. If I was not to go through what I went through, then I might not have been the OG that I am now. These are things that you have to go through to make you strong." He rubbished claims that his chain was stolen at an event in Kisumu. "It wasn't stolen and it wasn't [worth] Sh60,000 like reported previously. I was generous and I gave it out," he said.
