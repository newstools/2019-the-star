Harambee Stars financial woes escalated on Wednesday after Football Kenya Federation's revelation that the team is on the verge of being kicked out of their hotel in Egypt. Stars are lined up to confront the Pharaohs tomorrow but according to the federation, their stay in Egypt has not been smooth, thanks to delay from the government in footing their hotel bills. “The national team, Harambee Stars is on the verge of being evicted from their hotel in Egypt for lack of payment. Since Friday, Ministry officials have been promising to settle the payment but regrettably, this has not happened,” read a statement by the federation's acting chief executive officer Barry Otieno. Stars had to endure a 16-hour flight to Cairo via Dubai rather than five-hour direct flight after the government took charge of the team's itinerary. Otieno said the team is staring at eviction and hotel management has threatened to detain a number of the technical bench members until the bill is settled. “We have since been informed by the hotel that the team will be evicted and a few members of the technical team detained until payment is made,” said Barry.
