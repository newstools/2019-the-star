Mbeere South elders want a governor seat deal allegedly entered into by Embu communities in 2013 honoured. The elders from Ndamata and Mururi said that prior to the 2013 election, elders from the Embu and Mbeere communities and political players held several meetings and agreed the position be alternated after two consecutive terms. "The other time we agreed that the seat should go to Embu people for 10 years and it’s time for Mbeere people [come 2022], thus we are deliberating on whom to support for the seat," Nyaki Ngure said on their behalf. He said elders from Mbeere South and Mbeere North are discussing the 2022 politics basing on the 2013 pact and development issues. They said former Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti is the frontrunner. Kivuti lost to Governor Martin Wambora in the 2017 election and in a poll petition. He then pledged to support Wambora to fulfil his vision for residents and urged his supporters to support the governor. The elders said Kivuti is the most qualified to take up the reins of county government. They spoke at G8 Yatch Villa in the subcounty. Kivuti attended the meeting. Wambora will not be seeking reelection. He is barred by the Constitution as this is his second term. The elders said they play a critical role in guiding the community, including on socioeconomic issues, hence this was the beginning of a series of meetings they have lined up ahead of the next election. Kivuti said they met to discuss county and national politics, including the Building Bridges Initiative report that is to be released on Tuesday to President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. He said they had agreed politics focus on development and be devoid of chaos. (Edited by F'Orieny)
