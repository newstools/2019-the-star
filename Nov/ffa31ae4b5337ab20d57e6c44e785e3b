Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has picked the County Public Service Board chairman Johnston Namulala as Finance chief officer in an acting capacity. The move comes barely two weeks after Chrispinus Barasa tendered his resignation from the position citing personal reasons. Barasa served in the same capacity in Governor Kenneth Lusaka regime. He was among three chief officers that Wangamati retained when he took over in August 2017. Other chief officers who stayed in their jobs are Livestock’s Isaack Arbut and Caroline Musotso. Namulala is a former district officer who served as a financial accountant in the Mombasa county government. On Monday, Namulala told the Star that he has accepted to serve in the position to steer Bungoma to greater heights. He asked residents to support Wangamati's regime to deliver development across the nine constituencies. “I know it's an uphill task for me that will require a lot of cooperation from all stakeholders and I believe with my vast experience in accounting I will manage,” he said. Wangamati said that he is focused on transforming Bungoma. (edited by O. Owino)
