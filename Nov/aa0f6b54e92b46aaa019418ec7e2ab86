After a slow start to life in the Kenya Handball Federation national men's league, Kaluluini  are working on their speed  with the hope of turning around their poor form. The debutants have lost all their six matches to sit bottom of the 25-team table with no point at all. Despite winning tournaments in Meru, Embu and Upper Yatta prior to registering with KHF, Kaluluini have found the going tough. Inexperience has been partly blamed for the poor show. Kaluluini will look to address their offensive and defensive plays going forward having scored 164 and conceded 224 goals this far. The Machakos County-based club coach Ryan Mutunga said even though they have their work cut out, getting a  win will instil confidence into the team, dominated by high school students. "Having not won a single match concerns us but there's no cause for alarm. Our unfamiliarity with the league has been our undoing. Our play has lacked the high-speed demands of the league, something we are working on and we remain optimistic that once the players have adjusted, results will surely come," noted Kilonzo. "Players have promised to fight till the end and giving up is not our portion. Our first win is just on the way and it will mark a remarkable turnaround to the season. We are in the league to stay in the long term." Their corresponding women team are sailing in the same boat. Winless in their four matches and sit bottom of the table as well.
