The East African Safari Classic Rally moves into Day Three action this morning with Kenya’s Onkar Rai now leading the event in his Porsche 911. He failed to meet the deadline to start SS6 as the car was being nursed by the mechanics. Day Three will start at 7 am from the Mount Meru Hotel in Arusha before the crew tackle three competitive stages of the day. They will visit through Pantone/Samora (65.52kms), Manduli/Mto Wa Mbu (156.00kms) and Samora/Panone (64.52kms) before crews take a rest at the Mount Meru Hotel for the second consecutive night.
