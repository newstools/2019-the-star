Residents of Limuru have thanked the government for allocating Sh70 million to pipe water in the constituency. About 20,000 residents will benefit. The water will be pumped from a borehole that was dug by the Athi Water and Services Board (AWSB) about two years ago. Deputy President William Ruto commissioned the borehole on Saturday, sayingÂ  the Sh70 billion had been set aside to ensure all homes get water. Salome Wanja, 41, on Tuesday said they have been fetching water from wells in Roromo village, just near the borehole dug by AWSB. "We have been fetching water for many years," she said. Bibirioni MCA Jacquie Nungari said AWSB dug the borehole in Roromo since the area lies in the lower area of Uplands forest which is swampy. This is the source of Riara river. She said wells in Roromo never dry up, no matter how dry the country is. "The water from the borehole can be distributed throughout the whole constituency and even outside it," she said.
