Gospel star Ruth Matete has said she was aware that her husband John Apewajoye, aka Beloved John, had been married before they hooked up. John was previously married to Juliet Aihinomo Idehen who is based in Nigeria and they had two children. Matete told Word Is on Monday, “Tell her to provide proof they are still married. I am aware that John is her ex-husband but they are not married anymore. I know the children because they are my husband’s kids.” She walked down the aisle with John on November 22 at a private wedding. “The wedding was successful, we thank God,” she said. Previously, Matete, who is the daughter of Selina actor Abel Amunga, has opened up about growing in an abusive home. “My mum got married to another man and later she introduced me to my biological father. I had never been to school I was always at home doing house chores,” she told Ebru TV. “My stepdad was not so good to me and my mum.He was a drunk and he used to beat me a lot. She sensed it was time for her to go as she was always in and out of hospital. “My dad used to tell me that even when my mum was pregnant with me she was always sick from being beaten. He was a drunk and he used to beat me a lot. “My dad was also married and his wife was not so good to me, she would beat me everyday when she wanted to solve issues with me.”
