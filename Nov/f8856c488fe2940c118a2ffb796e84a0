The Building Bridges Initiative should be dropped. Its preparation and lobbying did not really involve Kenyans despite ‘extensive public participation’ being carried out. Only President Uhuru Kenyatta and handshake buddy Raila Odinga know the real intention of the proposal. The presentation of its report by the task force to the two is being stalled, further increasing the tension around the bill as Kenyans and politicians are left with a lot of time to speculate on its contents. Ugly splits are already manifesting themselves among our leaders who support or are against the bill, even before they know what they are being divided about. The bill is clearly not being treated with the urgency it deserves, so it is probably not as important as it has been portrayed to be.  Mombasa
