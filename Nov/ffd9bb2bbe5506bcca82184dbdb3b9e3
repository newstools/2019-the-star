xPodd Company Limited, a property-technology(ProTech) focused real estate firm has expanded its reach in Kenya, providing a real-time platform for real estate solutions in the country. Dubbed ‘xPodd’ the online platform enables the public, businesses and real estate developers connect on one platform where they can identify, acquire , let or rent property, eliminating middle men  where some real estate agents have been duping unsuspecting property seekers and landlords. “xPodd helps eliminate points of friction when it comes to finding a property and connecting directly with the landlord in a convenient, safe, cost effective and efficient way,” chairman Alastair Campbell said. The firm offers solutions for both commercial and residential properties in Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu and Kakamega, allowing seekers and finders to connect. According to the firm, Kenyans and property seekers have continued to lose money on non-existing properties hugely listed online, while some clients end up getting row deals. “You identify a house or land online only to get to the ground and find it’s something different. These are some of the things we want to eliminate by connecting the landlord or developer directly to the tenant or property seeker,” Chief Operations Officer Nekoye Inzaule. With more than five decades of insights and expertise, the firm is among the leading entities that have embraced ProTech, a digital transformation which has disrupted  the property industry in the wake of technology advancements and adoption by businesses in the country and globally. Among unique offerings by the company is an open police hotline during property viewing. “People have been robbed when they go viewing property. There is also a lot of photo shop for properties. These are some of the things we want to change by use of technology and real time deals,” Campbell said.
