The hopes of former Bomet chief staff Jayne Sigilai being appointed deputy governor seem to have been dashed after she was picked as chief officer in changes announced by Governor Hillary Barchok on Tuesday. Sigilai, a cousin to the late governor Joyce Laboso, had been endorsed by the family for the position. During the burial of Laboso in August, women leaders urged Governor Barchok to appoint a female deputy, preferably from the Laboso family. But in the reshuffle announced by the governor on Tuesday, Sigilai was appointed chief officer for social services. The changes affect 17 chief officers. Sigilai was the chief of staff during Labosoâ€™s administration but was replaced by William Kiprotich. Unconfirmed reports say the governor could appoint his deputy this week. Philemon Ruto of medical services and Joseph Kebenei (lands and urban planning) have been moved to environment and administration respectively. Their departments have come under sharp criticism from the public over poor services. Roads chief officer Victor Ngetich whose department has also been the subject of complaints was transferred to lands and urban planning and replaced by David Kikwai from finance. In a circular released to the press, the governor has increased the number of officers and brought in new faces in what he says was aimed at enhancing service delivery. Among the new hires are Milcah Rono, acting finance chief officer, Alex Chirchir (agriculture) and Joyce Tonui (medical services). In the other changes, David Cheruiyot will be in charge of public service and executive, David Koech (water and sanitation), Zaddy Chumo (public health) while Nicholus Kerich of youth and sports has swapped positions with Job Towett of cooperatives. Bernard Mutai of ICT and Simon Langat of education and vocational training retained their posts.
