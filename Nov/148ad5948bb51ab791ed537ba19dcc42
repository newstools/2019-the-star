Women across Africa are demanding better care from government-run hospitals in an effort to cut the number of lives lost during childbirth. A survey by the White Ribbon Alliance found that 300,000 women in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania are not satisfied with government-run hospitals. Many said that they shun government hospitals due to verbal abuse and harassment from medical staff and a lack of security. Their responses highlight a big disconnect between governments and women. The top issues that women want to be addressed include better sanitation in hospitals and more respectful and dignified care. According to the World Health Organization, more than 800 women die every day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth, with more than half of the deaths recorded in sub-Saharan Africa. In Kenya, itâ€™s estimated 22 women die every day from complications during childbirth. Women interviewed blamed this on negligence, poor infrastructure and high medical costs. This report is published ahead of the 25th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD).
