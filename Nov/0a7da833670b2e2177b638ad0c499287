Embu Council of Elders has supported the Building Bridges Initiative proposals,  arguing they will unite the country. They have asked the county residents to back it. The Nyangi  Ndiiriri Council of Elders said they were pleased when President Uhuru Kenyatta put aside his pride after the fiercely contested presidential elections and reached out to his rival ODM leader Raila Odinga. Speaking at their offices in Embu town, the elders said it was impressive for the President to reach out to Raila and come up with the BBI, an indication, they said, showed Kenya is bigger than any individual. The elders, led by chairman Andrew Ireri, said most of the proposals in the report are good and seek to better the welfare of wananchi. Ireri said politicians criticising the handshake and the report should be ignored because were it not for the move the two made, Kenya would not be the same again. He hailed Uhuru and Raila for coming up with the BBI, saying that its implementation will play a big role in uniting the country and building cohesion that lacks during elections. “We as elders we have sat and resolved to support the BBI report after deliberating on it thoroughly. We have found that it’s a good document as it has touched on the issues that generally affect the common man,” Ireri said. He said the elders will rally the people of Embu behind to try and mobilize people to support the report. They at the same time urged the President to consider having the Jamhuri Day Celebrations on December 12 being held in Embu so that the residents can feel they are part of the country.
