Isiolo Governor Mohamed Kuti has said Lands CS Faridah Karoney should not gazette community land used by pastoralists. Such land should not undergo adjudication, he said. “We are not against it but we said urban centres like Isiolo, Garbatula, Kina, Kula Mawe and Ngaremale should be given title deeds but grazing fields should be gazetted as community land as we do not want them to be lost,” he said. He said the decision was made without considering the community's grazing lands, livestock holding areas and disputed land with the military. Kuti spoke at Noloroi Primary School in Oldonyiro during a land dispute meeting attended by the national government’s security officers and area residents. The county boss expressed dissatisfaction, saying his office was not consulted before commencement of the adjudication process. Kuti said it was important to engage the residents of Isiolo prior to taking any action, arguing that any breach of the laid out procedures was likely to face apathy from members of public. Governor Kuti also reiterated the need for CS Karoney to clearly state the size of land set aside for military camps within Isiolo county, since the matter had created fears of displacement among residents.
