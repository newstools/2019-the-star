A helicopter carrying Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and his Devolution counterpart Eugene Wamalwa was forced to land in Eldoret on Monday morning due to bad weather. The cabinet secretaries were also accompanied by the Police Inspector General Hillary Mutyambai. The team was on their way to Kapenguria in West Pokot to access the situation following the weekend landslide that has so far claimed 52 lives. "We have been forced to land in Eldoret. We were on our way to Kapenguria Referral Hospital to meet leaders and victims of the landslide in West Pokot. We left Nairobi at 8:30 in the morning. The weather is very bad. We do not want to defy the advisory that we are getting from the pilot and the experts we are with," Matiang'i said. The CS said they will wait to see if the weather will improve before they embark on their journey. He added that the government is committed to addressing the challenges of West Pokot residents. Matiang'i said the government has so far dispatched relief food, mattresses and blankets to the affected families. Wamalwa said that the government is working around the clock to ensure maximum support is given to all the affected families. Rift Valley Regional Coordinator George Natembeya accompanied the team. Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, Senator Aaron Cheruiyot, Belgut MP Nelson Koech and Jubilee Kibra candidate McDonald Mariga visited the affected families on Sunday. Murkomen urged the families to move to safer grounds in order to avoid being caught up in another tragedy. Matiang'i also called upon the security team to evacuate people who are still living in the earmarked areas for possible floods due to the ongoing rains.
