World champions Hellen Obiri and Beatrice Chepkoech have missed out on the final shortlist for the IAAF athlete of the Year award as world marathon record holder Brigid Kosgei makes the cut. Obiri bagged a second world championship crown in Doha last month adding onto the World cross country title she won in Aarhus, Denmark. She also set the fastest time in the world this year in the 5,000m, clocking 14:20.36 in London. Meanwhile, Chepkoech bagged the 3,000m steeplechase Diamond League Trophy as well as winning seven of her eight steeplechase races in the year, including the world crown in a championship record of 8:57.84 in Doha. Kosgei retained her spot in the top five in the IAAF shortlist following a stellar season that culminated in a marathon world record at last month's Chicago Marathon, posting 2:14:04. She also won the London Marathon title in April. Kosgei also ran a world-leading times of 1:05:28 and 1:04:28 in the half marathon. She faces a stern test to win the coveted award which has never been won by a Kenyan since inception it's in 1988. Kosgei will be up against Jamaica's Shely Anne Fraser, who clinched the world 100m and 4x100m titles in world-leading times of 10.71 and 41.44, won Pan-American 200m title and won seven of her 10 races at 100m. Double world champion Hassaan Sifan makes the cut after a sensational year on the track. She won the 1,500m and 10,000m titles in world-leading times of 3:51.95 and 30:17.62 as well as the Diamond League 1,500m and 5,000m titles. She also broke the world mile record with a 4:12.33 clocking in Monaco. World 400m hurdles champion Delilah Muhammed of the USA is a strong contender for the award, having smashed the world record in the one-lap race twice this season. First at the US Athletic trials where she ran 52.20 before lowering on route to winning the world title in 52.16 as well as being part of the 4x 400m relay team which bagged gold in Doha. Yulimar Rojas of Venezuela is in the final shortlist of five after winning the world triple jump title with a leap of 15.37m. She also jumped a world-leading 15.41m to move to second on the world all-time list as well as winning nine of her 12 competitions, including the Pan-American Games. A three-way voting process determined the finalists. The World Athletics Council and the World Athletics Family cast their votes by email, while fans voted online via the IAAF social media platforms. The Council’s vote counted for 50 per cent of the result, while the Athletics Family’s votes and the public votes each counted for 25 per cent of the final result. The male and female World Athletes of the Year will be announced live on stage at the World Athletics Awards 2019 in Monaco on November 23.
