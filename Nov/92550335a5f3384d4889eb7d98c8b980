Two AP officers attached to Jamhuri police post were on Friday sentenced to one year in jail for abducting a Burundian officer and dumping him in a forest. The officers were given an alternative fine of Sh1 million each. Wycliffe Nyakundi and Benson Wamaitha were convicted by Kibera senior principal magistrate Esther Boke after the prosecution proved its case against them. The two were accused that on May 25, 2016 at Capricon Grand Restaurant  behind Nakumatt Prestige  along Ng’ong Road in Nairobi, they abducted Buregeya Athanaze to Ng’ong forest with the intention of killing him. They denied the charges and were released on bond. Athanaze testified that he had passed through Ng’ong Road and decided to get into the hotel to greeting his friends. “I was coming from work through Ng’ong Road. I passed Ng'ong Hills Hotel to see a colleague who were attending a counter-terrorism work shop. From the hotel I went to Capricorn Restaurant  and ordered a drink." While relaxing, one of the accused flashed a light on his face. “The second accused person came and flashed me with torch on my face and said that he was a police officer. He threatened to kill me if I did not cooperate . He showed me a pistol from his waist,” he told court. The two officers then took him into a taxi which was driven by Zacharia Muthoni, the third accused who was acquitted due to lack of evidence of criminal involvement. He said the vehicle was diverted to a different route when they reached the Southern By-pass. The officers demanded Sh200,000 to release the Burundian. They later ordered a driver to drop him back at the hotel. In their defense, the officers told court that they went to the hotel to arrest a drug trafficker, who was the complainant.
