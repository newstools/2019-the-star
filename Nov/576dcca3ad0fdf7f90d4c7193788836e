 A suspected criminal was gunned down on Thursday as he tried to snatch a gun from a police officer guarding a bank in Mombasa. Mombasa police boss Eliud Monara said an unidentified man was shot dead as he tried to snatch a gun from a police officer. "The officer was going for a shot call when the suspect attacked him from behind with a huge stone," Monara said. Witness David Muthoni said the suspect snatched the gun from the officer and tried to shoot him but it was not cocked. He said the officer took back the gun and shot the attacker. "He was shot twice on the chest and on both his neck and hand," Muthoni said. The police officer was taken to Coast General Hospital where he was receiving treatment following the injuries sustained. Police said the suspect could not be identified because he did not have any documents on him. The body was taken to Coast General Hospital Mortuary. There were two police officers guarding the bank when the incident happened. In February 2015, a police officer guarding Gulf Bank along Biashara Street in Bondeni, Mombasa, was shot dead after his gun was snatched by thugs.  edited by p. obuya
