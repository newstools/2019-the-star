The thieves who broke into Family Bank–Ruiru branch and stole over Sh19.2 million in July might have accessed the facility through the kitchen roof. John Muchiri, the head of security at the bank head office, in his testimony on Thursday said that when he arrived at the bank he discovered that the alarm system had been tampered with. “On checking, I discovered that the fire alarm system had been vandalised," he said. Muchiri said the thieves managed to access the strong room to the safe by cutting the door using welding gas cylinder power. They further accessed the ATM machine using crow bars. Police recovered a gas cylinder and four crow bars at the scene. In the case, operations supervisor Cyrus Mugo, tellers Nancy Njeri and Sally Mureithi, Francis Lucigi Shego, Michael Rapando, Malobo and Robert Ndururi, a guard, have denied stealing the money. The hearing of the case will continue on December 4. Senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo of Kiambu adjourned the case after Muchiri completed his testimony. The prosecution says all the accused persons broke into Family Bank–Ruiru branch and stole Sh19,204,563, 210 euros and $570 on the night of July 14 and 15. The guard alone also faces a second count of neglecting to prevent theft despite being assigned to guard the bank as a back-up security team. The court heard that Radar security company guards normally patrol outside the bank and they are custodian of the gate keys to the parking yard.
