Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has refused the order to dismiss his sports and Youth CEC Karungo wa Thang'wa from office. According to the County Governments Act, the governor is mandated to sign the dismissal of any county officer. Waititu's remarks come after Kiambu MCAs last week adopted a report to remove Thang'wa from office on allegations of incompetence and abuse of office. The report was read out in the assembly by Limuru East MCA Peter Karuga. None of the 62 MCAs present opposed the report. In a statement to Kiambu county assembly speaker on Thursday, Waititu said he will not dismiss his CEC for that would further contravene a court order which is a criminal offence. The embattled governor said Thang'wa will remain lawfully in the office to discharge his duties. Thang'wa on October 24 said plans by Kiambu MCAs to impeach him were more political than factual. He said the move is meant to malign his name and settle political scores. He called upon the county assembly to accord him an opportunity to set the record straight. The CEC then appeared before a committee of five MCA's formed to investigate him. He further excused himself from the proceedings after the committee declined to provide him with particulars of his charges, laying grounds for the legal battle. In a court ruling on November 8, Waititu was also barred from acting on the impeachment motion. "Any disobedience or non-observance of the order of the court given on NovemberÂ  7, 2019, served will result in penal consequences to you(petitioner) and any other persons so disobeying and not observing the same," read the court order.
