Lately, a good number of companies have fired employees on the claim of a harsh economic environment to operate the business. While some companies notify their employees of a possible mass firing, some fire them without any notice. Being fired is painful regardless of whether notice had been given or not, and therefore, it always leaves one in a state of desperation which may mentally affect the victim. To show care and humanity, companies should do all they can to prepare their employees psychologically, particularly when mass firing is looming. Employees on their part should take dismissal as a normal occurrence and stay prepared should it come their way so that it does not push them to early graves or depression.  Nairobi
