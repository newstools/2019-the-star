A prominent Kamba politician is set to wed the love of his life before the end of this year. The man, who came into the limelight for his movie-directing skills in 2008, has decided to finally officiate his union. The soon-to-be husband was previously married for 18 years, before parting ways with his first wife in a court battle that cost him some of his properties. The couple had three kids. The politician has since moved on and is set to wed a second time between now and next month. The couple has been dating for some years and flaunts their relationship on social media. On various occasions, the couple's relationship has been dubbed as 'Couple Goals'. The woman, whom many refer as to 'First Lady', despite not being officially married, recently graduated with a Masters of Science degree at Jkuat.
