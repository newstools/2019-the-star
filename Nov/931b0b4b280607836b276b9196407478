Nairobi county may cease to operate independently if the Building Bridges Initiative proposals will be implemented. Under the BBI proposals, the National Government is set to carry out some functions in the city. The report which was unveiled to the public by President Uhuru Kenyatta at Bomas of Kenya on Wednesday has proposed Nairobi be accorded a special status. "However, such special Status should not impede on the right of the people to representation at the Ward and Constituency levels," the report reads. Nairobi being the capital city houses all the arms of the Government and is also an International City being the third Global Headquarters of the United Nations. The capital is also a major diplomatic hub as many nations have located their representatives to bodies like the United Nations Environmental Program in the city. "To maintain its special status as a global UN Headquarter and meet its obligation towards the United Nations and other diplomatic missions," the report states. Under the proposal, Nairobi will be handed massive investments in infrastructure that the formula of the Commission for Revenue Allocation cannot accommodate. During the 55th Jamhuri Day celebrations, Governor Mike Sonko said the partnership between his administration and the national government has helped develop Nairobi. He thanked Uhuru for his support on city projects. Sonko said the Nairobi Regeneration Committee he co-chairs with Tourism CS Najib Balala, has helped clean the Nairobi River ecosystem. He said there is a joint strategy for the Rapid Bus Transit System and commuter rail to create reliable public transport in the city Other programmes include the construction of fire stations and rehabilitation of city markets.
