Former President Daniel Moi was yesterday still at The Nairobi Hospital where he was admitted last Saturday. It is the third time the 95-year-old retired head of state is admitted to hospital in less than two months. Doctors say he has recurring chest complications that affect his breathing. “Once again I assure Kenyans that Mzee Moi is alert and being attended to by a professional medical team led by his personal physician Dr David Silverstein,” Moi press secretary and official spokesperson  Lee Njiru said in a press statement yesterday. He was responding to a Star story that Moi had been readmitted to the hospital two days after being discharged. “I appeal to the press fraternity not to cause unwarranted alarm by exploiting the credulity of the masses,” Njiru said. He said the former President was undergoing routine medical check-up after being admitted on November 9 in the VIP wing. Njiru had last Thursday announced that the former President had been allowed to go home after spending 10 days in the hospital. This was after his medical team gave him a clean bill of health after spending days in the Intensive Care Unit. The doctors said he would be monitored from his Kabarnet home, Nairobi.
