A source confirmed the report and shared an exclusive photo from the actress’s baby bump photoshoot. The mother of one has kept her pregnancy away from the limelight after she suffered a miscarriage last year when she was five months along. “I did not want to reveal about being pregnant, even to my parents, because it is not easy losing a baby and carrying another one. It still hurts,” Njambi told Word Is a while back. Sharing a photo to describe the miscarriage, she wrote, “I might not be ready to talk about it but I still remember…… Good morning.” Our source said Njambi’s pregnancy will be revealed in The Real Househelps of Kawangware next week. Njambi and her baby daddy are doing well. She broke up with her first baby daddy. “My ex and I messed up in the relationship as we were young and stupid and we didn’t have the strength to fight for us,” the actress said. “However, my current baby daddy is very supportive and he loves my daughter and that is all that matters. He has had my back since we  met.”
