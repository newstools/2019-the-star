A man suspected to be a police officer has died after a fire gutted a room he had rented at Kapkugerwet market in Kericho. His identity and the cause of the fire were not immediately known. His body was taken to Kericho Level-Four Hospital mortuary. The Wednesday blaze destroyed property worth millions of shillings. It was put out by county and James Finalys Company firefighters. Kericho police commander Silas Mathiu declined to confirm or deny that the dead was a police officer attached to Chagaik patrol base. During the incident, a number of those who posed as rescuers turned looters. They broke into nearby shops that were not affected by the fire. Businesses that suffered heavily included Loto gambling booths and wines and spirits outlets. Ainamoi MP Silvanus Martim sought to assure the affected traders that he will hold a funds drive to help them rebuild their businesses.Â He called for the establishment of water points where firefighters can easily draw water for putting out such a fire.
