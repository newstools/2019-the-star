A woman who is suspected of stabbing her boyfriend has been detained for 14 days pending investigations. Anne Wambui is alleged to have stabbed Derrick Mutahi, 23, several times on claims she suspected him of cheating. Mutahi was found dead in bed at their rented house at Pipeline Estate in Embakasi, Nairobi county. Investigating officer Paul Muli said the murder is suspected to have taken place on the night of November 23. A bloodstained knife suspected to be the murder weapon was recovered at the crime scene, he said. He told Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga that Mutahi was found with visible stab wounds. “A postmortem has not been conducted to establish the cause of death," he told the court. Muli added that he needed more time to trace and record statements of witnesses from the estate. He said Wangari also needs to undergo a mental test at Mathare Mental Hospital to establish if she is fit to stand trial. “The knife will be taken to the government chemist laboratory for analysis,” the officer said in his affidavit. The case will be mentioned on December 9. Edited by R.Wamochie
