Wajir county has formalised its engagement with the Kenya Red Cross Society in programmes of water supply, sanitation, health and fighting extremism. The agreement was signed on Friday by Governor Mohamed Abdi and the incoming Red Cross secretary general Dr Asha Mohamed at the society's headquarters in Nairobi. It aims to further the decade-long partnership. Other areas of cooperation are youth empowerment, nutrition,  improved resilience to disasters and climate change, strengthened disaster mitigation, preparedness and response and capacity building. Abdi, who was accompanied by senior county staff, said the Red Cross has always been at the forefront in responding to disasters, citing the ongoing floods. He said the institution stood out during the August 7, 1998, Kenyans for Kenya Initiative by responding to the fatal droughts in Turkana and the other emergency responses. “Red Cross in a household name in Kenya, whenever a disaster happens, they will always be the first one to respond. It is because of such a strong base that we don't hesitate to formally cooperate with the society," he said. Abdi urged other non-government organisations to borrow a leaf from the KRC in assisting communities in their areas of jurisdiction. “All the agreements that we have penned today will be fully implemented. I must say that Wajir is so far in the lead in the programmes we are undertaking in  Northern counties,” Mohamed said. Wajir Red Cross coordinator Abdia Manya said the organisation was currently engaged in youth empowerment programmes across the county including the fight against violent extremism.
