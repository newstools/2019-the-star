Meru advocates have condemned the increase of quack lawyers in the county. Counsel Ashford Riungu on Saturday said there are about 100 qualified advocates in Meru. "We have an almost similar number of quacks, they walk around in ties, carry files and documents associated with lawyers and have very neat offices but cannot file any case in court." Riungu said many residents with succession cases have been taking them to quack lawyers. "When it comes to attending the case they tell clients to wait outside the courtroom and cheat them on the outcome of cases they have not even filed," he said. There is a big difference between a lawyer and an advocate, he said. "A lawyer is the one who has undergone studies but has not undertaken the one-year mandatory course with the Law Society of Kenya to be admitted to the bar and file cases. All advocates are a lawyer but not all lawyers are advocates," Riungu said. Advocate Marius Maranya said many cases in the county are related to land. "The Chief Justice should send many judges to deal with land cases to reduce crime," Maranya said. They spoke in the sidelines of a legal clinic for Municipality ward at Kamunde hall in North Imenti constituency. Municipality MCA Elias Murega said such clinics will expose residents to dealing with legal cases and knowing their rights as enshrined in the Constitution.Â He said he will partner with such parties to do more legal clinics in Meru town. Justice Ann Ongijo said residents who are learned should strive to avoid using local language in court. She said in some cases, interpreters can send the wrong message in some distinct words adding that language barrier has been a challenge in handling some cases. Edited by R.Wamochie
