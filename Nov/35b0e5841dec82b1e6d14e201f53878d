Youth have been urged to approach the BBI report with an open mind and to be driven by the urge and the shared vision of a better Kenya for all. In a statement by One Love Kenya founder Kevin Cassypool on Thursday, youth were cautioned against forming decisions based on third parties who may use them for ulterior agenda. "Once the BBI report is out, youths should go through the same and make informed decisions and not rely on third parties whose only objective is to use them to actualise their ulterior agenda," read the statement. The Building Bridges Initiative task force on October 23  completed filing its report after collecting views from Kenyans across the country. The task force held its last formal sitting at the Task-force secretariat where they finalised the report and communicated to the President's office. "The joint Secretaries have officially communicated to the Office of the President that the Building Bridges Initiative report is ready for handing over to the President," part of joint task force statement signed by BBI joint secretaries Paul Mwangi and Martin Kimani read. The task force said that they have already received word that the handover will be scheduled at the first available opportunity. According to the task force, the views to be presented to the President take into account the views of Kenyans from the 47 counties, including testimonies and petitions from the professional bodies.
