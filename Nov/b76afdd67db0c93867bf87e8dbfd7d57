Two lobby groups have moved to court challenging the appointment of eight members to the Independent Police Oversight Authority board. Katiba Institute and Kariobangi Paralegals have sued Ipoa and Joseph Kinyua for the appointment. The members are Muthaura Doreen Nkatha, Tororey Praxedes, Waiganjo John, Anne Makori, Fatuma Mohamud, Jonathan Lodompui, Water Ogony, Jimmy Mwithi. The lobbies have challenged the appointment terming it irregular. "Besides, the salaries and other allowances they continue to earn, having been appointed irregularly, may not be recorded and offends the law on prudent use of state resources. The petition and application ought to be heard urgently to forestall the irreparable loss of public resources," they argue. They want the court to suspend the full-time appointment of the members in a letter dated November 20 issued by the Head of Public Service. They have argued that Nkatha, Praxedes and Muriithi never applied and were not shortlisted or interviewed for the position of members. The lobby group further claims that Kinyua unilaterally, purportedly acting as Head of Public Service–a position not in known in law, appointed the members. “The state failed to uphold the national principals and values of rule of law, non-discrimination, equality, good governance and transparency required in the process of interviews and appointment for all individuals interviewed,” the petition reads.
