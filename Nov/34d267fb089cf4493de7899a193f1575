Harambee Starlets hopes of qualifying for a first-ever Olympic Games were dashed yesterday after they were beaten 1-0 by Zambia's Copper Queens in Lusaka. Coach David Ouma had made only one change to his starting line up from the team that was held to a 2-2 draw in the first leg at Kasarani last Friday. School girl Jentrix Shikangwa was handedÂ a starting berth in place of Janet Bundi as Starlets sought to go for broke in the return leg. Kenya conceded a penalty midway through the first half after Barbara Banda was brought down in the box but goalkeeper Annette Kundu saved the subsequent spot-kick by Rachel Kundananji to keep the scores level going into the break. Mwemba Lushomo gave Zambia the lead with an hour played and the hosts held onto their lead to reach the finals stage of the CAF qualifiers for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Meanwhile, with no domestic action this weekend, Kenya Premier league leaders Gor Mahia travel to Libya this morning for an invitational friendly against Libyan giants Al Hilal Benghazi. On Sunday, Gor reclaimed top spot in the KPL standings after thrashing arch-rivals AFC Leopards 4-1. The friendly clash has been slated for Saturday in the city of Benghazi. Steven Polack will travel with players not called up for international duty. The international brigade from his squad includes goalkeeper David Mapigano, who has been called up for Tanzania. Others are Harambee Stars regulars of defender Joash Onyango, midfielder Kenneth Muguna and Lawrence Juma.
