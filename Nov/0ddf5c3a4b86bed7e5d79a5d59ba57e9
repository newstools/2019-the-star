 Deputy President William Ruto has asked West Pokot residents living in dangerous areas to move to safer places to help avert more deaths. Landslide on Saturday killed at least 43 people in the North Rift county following heavy rains. Speaking at Kapenguria County Referral Hospital after visiting victims on Monday, Ruto said that the government was mapping unsafe areas. "The emergency team is currently mapping areas which are unsafe and very soon we are going to evacuate people from those places,” Ruto said. He said the government was committed to ensuring people are moved to safer places. He directed the county commissioner to ensure residents are evacuated to safer areas until when the rains have subsided. He said that government will help victims to rebuild their lives. “We have a team of 40 doctors from Eldoret who will attend to victims and we have enough drugs and foodstuff that will help the affected," he said. The Deputy President said helicopter will be stationed at the county headquarters to help in emergency cases. “Most of the roads are impassable and the helicopter will help in delivering foodstuffs, drugs and airlifting doctors to various villages.” “We want to ensure that everybody that was affected is attended to. We have a team of psychological counselors from Eldoret who are going to help the affected.” He said most of the survivors were traumatised and the counselors will help them in coping up with life again. The deputy president directed the department of public works to start repairing and clearing roads to ensure transport returns to normal. Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital surgeon Tabu Simiyu said there were 13 patients admitted at the facility after the landslide disaster.  edited by peter obuya
