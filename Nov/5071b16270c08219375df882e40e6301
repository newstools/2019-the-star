On the other hand, male candidates performed slightly better than their female counterparts in mathematics, science and social studies and Religious Education. Magoha said all class eight pupils will be placed in high school​ by December 2. Placement of candidates will start on Tuesday to December 2. "I assure all candidates that by December they will know which schools they will go to," he said. The CS said the selection will be fair, transparent and fast. "Parents will have enough time to prepare their children for high school re-entry. They won't spend all the money on food during Christmas," he said. He further said 9000 scholarships will be awarded to candidates, with 30 per cent awarded to candidates from slums in inner major cities.
