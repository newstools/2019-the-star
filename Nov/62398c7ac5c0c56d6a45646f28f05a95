Berlin retained the Chapa Dimba na Safaricom North Eastern region title after beating Al Ansar 2-0 at the Technical Training College grounds in Garissa. After a goalless first half, Berlin opened the scoresheet in the 67th minute through Noor Osman with Abdalla Marro adding a second in the 88th minute. It was a repeat of last season's final, which Berlin won via a penalty shootout. “We have been training hard in preparation for this tournament rectifying the past mistakes we made in the National Finals and this time we promise to put up a better performance to enable us to come home with the main cup," said Berlin's top scorer Abdalla Marro. "I have also been crowned the most valuable player and I would like to thank my coach and my team as it was a collective effort that earned me this title." The winning team walked away with Sh200,000 in cash and will represent the region at the national finals set for June 2020 at Bomu Stadium, Mombasa. The runners-up received Sh100,000 with players taking home a host of individual prizes. The tournament now moves to Mombasa, where the Coast regional finals will be held on December 7 and 8 at Bomu Stadium. The Coast regional finals will also feature coaching clinics by Spanish La Liga coaches.
