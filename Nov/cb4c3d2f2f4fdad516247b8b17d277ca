A female KCSE candidate at a school in Kwanza subcounty has had to be prayed for before sitting her examinations after developing mysterious fainting bouts. Mutua Secondary School principal John Ndung’u said that they had to seek prayers to assist the candidate who only developed the condition last week. Ndung’u said that they have been forced to rely on the Catholic nuns to pray for her before sitting any paper The school which is located on the border of Trans Nzoia and West Pokot counties has 31 candidates who hope to defy infrastructural challenges to excel. "Every time the girl sees the exams, she starts fainting. We thought she may be possed by demons," the principal said. Meanwhile, at St Paul's Bwayi Mixed Secondary School, a male candidate refused to sit his examination for unknown reasons. “We tried to persuade him to sit for his exams but he could not heed our call. The rest of the 34 candidates are doing well,” the school principal Geoffrey Khisa said. Elsewhere, at Keese Secondary School, five girls are among the 41 candidates sitting the exams. The institution started admitting girls after halting a phaseout plan. “We have few girls in our institution since an attempt to make this a boys' school was quashed following a low population,” principal Salim Rashid said. Trans Nzoia has also experienced fewer cases of teenage pregnancies among candidates sitting this year's examinations compared to cases reported in 2018. This has been archived through a multi-sectoral approach to curb the vice. Among the 125 candidates sitting the examination at St Emmanuel Mixed Secondary School in Kwanza constituency, five are expectant while six delivered in the course of the year. “We have noticed a positive trend this year compared to last year owing to the prosecution of culprits,” principal Cornelius Mukhwana said.
