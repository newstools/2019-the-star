Deputy President William Ruto has said the BBI report has covered the majority of the problems facing Kenyans and politicians should not hijack it for their interests. Ruto said all Kenyans will have time to read the BBI report and highlight their opinions. "We must be careful that this process is not hijacked by the political class and be made the project of sharing powers," Ruto added. Ruto said there will be no inferior or superior opinions and that every Kenyan will have an opportunity to read it. "The BBI report will form national conversations where all of us as Kenyans can air views openly and frankly so that we can have an informed conversation," Ruto said. Ruto also applauded President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga's action to unite the country through the BBI. The Deputy President added that theÂ report will form the basis for a united nation. He also added that all Kenyans should submit to the rule of law. "We must respect the institutions that have been set up," Ruto said. Ruto said the reform will create a united nation where the losers and winners will be part of the government. He said the country must address the fear and the challenges of ordinary people and should not only be about sharing positions and power. He said the country should avoid a costly, controversial and divisive process and that BBI taskforce confirms that it is possible to build consensus.
