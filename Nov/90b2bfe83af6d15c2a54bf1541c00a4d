Betway in conjunction with St. John's ambulance facilitated a medical training camp for football teams at the Dandora Stadium on Thursday and yesterday. The two-day event began with a theory on the first day and practical application conducted on the second day. Hakati Sportiff-a community-based club in Makadara, Nairobi was one of the beneficiaries of this initiative along with 16 others.Â  One of their players Vincent Ochieng Ogono, lost his life in 2017 due to lack of proper on-field medical attention. Betway Country Manager Leon Kiptum was happy to to be associated with the medical unit as they strive to affect the lives of many. He said: "We have seen a gap in our sports scene that has greatly affected our teams and we decided to come and assist where we can. We are glad that St. John's Ambulance was willing to come on board and help. We hope to affect more teams around the country with this initiative." The betting firm will also donate training equipment such as balls and bibs for the 17 teams that use Dandora Stadium as their home ground. Betway's decision was necessitated because of the teams' lack of basic healthcare knowledge and inadequate access to suitable medical facilities. Most teams lack the appropriate equipment and training to provide adequate medical care despite the community stadia undergoing renovation by the local council and teams being more motivated by the improved facilities.
