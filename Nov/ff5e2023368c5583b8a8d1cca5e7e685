With his team facing imminent relegation should they not honour this weekend's Kenyan Premier League fixture away to Wazito, Chemelil Sugar chairman Collins Agai has admitted that the club is living under a cloud of uncertainty on and off the pitch. Last week, Chemelil saw their neighbours Sony Sugar relegated from the top flight league after missing three matches in the season and Agai was concerned that a similar fate may befall his club. “We are still experiencing challenges in the team in terms of finances. We are searching here and there for money to see if we can make it to our next game,” disclosed a distressed Agai. The 2003 Kenya Cup winners have already missed two matches against KCB and Bandari. According to the rules that saw Sony kicked out, Chemelil will be ousted from KPL should they not honour their match against Wazito. Following the review of the match officials' report on the match between Zoo Kericho and Sony earlier planned for November  20 in Kericho, Sony failed to honour the match and were thus relegated according to the league's rules and regulations. “We have had trouble since March when the company left us. This has affected the team but we are trying our best to seek funds. We are in a precarious situation but there is little we can do,” admitted the Chemelil boss. The financial problems have already seen coach Francis Baraza keep off the club with reports suggesting that players are set to follow suit if the club is relegated. "Baraza is still not with the team. But we have coaches who are in charge of the training as we continue to seek a solution to our current situation," confirmed Agai. Club stalwart and assistant coach Charles Odero has been in charge of the team for the better part of this month. The Sugar millers are bottom of the KPL table with a solitary point.
