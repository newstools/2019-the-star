A civil society group has advised men not to harm themselves out of anger whenever they are left by their wives. Sauti ya Wanaume na Watoto chairman Bishop James Njenga yesterday said many men commit suicide, abuse alcohol, engage in drug abuse and some get depressed. Njenga urged men to seek support from church leaders, professional counsellors and close friends since the life of a person is very important. “When men are left by their wives, especially in cases of separation or divorce, a higher percentage of them are affected psychologically and need help. They behave as if they are mad. They do not take a bath, people notice changes,” he said. He added, “It is important if you have a relative, a friend or even a brother who has such as case, it is your duty to take up the role to help them access a counsellor, a pastor or a close friend to advise them that is not the end of the world.” The cleric spoke at Ndeiya village in Kiambu county where a 69-year-old man was found dead in his wooden house on Thursday night last week. Njenga said the man had separated with his wife some years ago, and he was living alone. “People told us that they walked out to see what was burning at night. It was past midnight and they started screaming for help. After putting the fire out, they realised that their neighbour was inside,” he said. He urged police to investigate the cause of the fire.  The body of Peter Njuguna was taken to Tigoni subcounty hospital mortuary for post mortem.
