A sustainable development conference starts today at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology (JKUAT) main campus in Juja. Participants at the two-day conference will include policymakers, industrialists, funding organs and researchers. Themed ‘Leveraging on Research, Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Sustainable Development’, the conference will discuss the role of research, entrepreneurship and innovation in sustainable development in developing countries. It will also discuss climate change management, modern waste management, agricultural technologies, food and nutritional security, policy and governance. ICT Principal Secretary Jerome Ochieng will open the conference. The conference comes at a time when sustainable development has taken on increased importance in light of rising urban growth. The 2018 Revision of World Urbanization Prospects by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) projects that the world's urban population will increase to 68 per cent by 2050 from the current 55 per cent. Most of this growth is projected to occur in developing countries. Consequently, urbanisation experts warn that the challenges in these areas may increase if sustainability is not incorporated.
