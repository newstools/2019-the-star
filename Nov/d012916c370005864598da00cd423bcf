Two foreigners have 72 hours to clear their Sh382,832  hotel bill or face the law. The two, a man and his lawyer, are from Botswana and have been staying at the Emerald Hotel in Westlands. Chief magistrate Joyce Gandani ordered Sejero Marapel and Laetsang Kopolerero to pay the bill before checking out. According to the charge sheet, the two are accused of falsely obtaining credit to the amount of Sh382,832 between September 20 and October 31. Kopolerero flew into the country with his lawyer Marapel and a colleague only identified as Mpumellelo for business. Kopolerero was to take care of all their bills, Marapel told the court. Marapel was to help Kopolerero go through contracts and witness their signing. However, Kopolerero found he had been duped out of millions of shillings by a "well-wisher". He then decided it was every man for himself and stopped paying the bills for the other two. Mpumellelo is said to have sneaked away after he lied that he was going to get money to pay the hotel. Marapel urged the court to allow him to speak to his daughter, who lives in California, to help him settle the bill. “With the detention, it has been very difficult to reach out for help. I urge the court to help me access my phone to call my people,” he said. According to a police report filed in court, the two promised to pay their bills every five days but after more than a week at the hotel, they refused to pay. They gave false payment promises, prompting the management to report the matter to Parklands police station, which led to their arrest. Gandani gave them three days to pay the bill and ordered that they be detained at the police station meanwhile. She asked the investigating officer and the hotel management to help them contact their relatives to facilitate payment of the bill. The case will be heard on Friday for further directions.
