Garissa women representative Anab Gure is surprised that some Kenyans are spending much of their time talking about the Building Bridges taskforce report. According to her, in the first place, it was wrong for the committee to be formed. Speaking at a function in Garissa town on Thursday, the Jubilee MP regretted that politicians have over the years used ordinary Kenyans to advance selfish agenda. “From where I sit first as a Kenyan and a political leader, this thing (BBI) is a waste of tax payers money. Honestly, it has completely nothing to do with the common mwananchi. The reality of things on the ground is that people are not interested with it,” she said. Anab, who is a member of the Inua Mama Mashinani, a women MPs outfit supporting Deputy President William Ruto, said Kenyans are now "much more smatter and will never accept to be taken for granted by self seeking politicians." Last week, Garissa leaders cautioned politicians against opposing recommendations by the Building Bridges Initiative task-force even before they are made public.
