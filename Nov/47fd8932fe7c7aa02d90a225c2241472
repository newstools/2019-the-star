Doctors conducting free cleft lip surgery at the Garissa County Referral Hospital on Saturday stumbled on a rare cleft mandible in an eight-year-old boy. Doctors corrected the problem for Salman Bashir from Iftin in Garissa township subcounty. Private hospitals had demanded exorbitant sums. Lead surgeon Dr Mahabur Rahman Khan from Bangladesh said it was his first encounter with the rare birth defect, having worked in many countries for more than 10 years. "We have successfully conducted the cleft mandible surgery, putting an end to the agony of the family who lived with the pain of seeking treatment for their child,"  Dr Khan said. Zeinab Sait, Salman's mother, said she had been visiting the referral hospital for last eight years to seek help for her child. “I can’t tell you how happy I am. The joy I have is beyond words. I never in my wildest imagination thought that my child would one day have his cleft corrected. It really broke my heart whenever I looked at him knowing that it was a condition that can be corrected,” she said. She said the family has been unable to raise money for private hospital care. The Department of Health, the Kenya Progressive Nurses Association and Bela Risu Foundation performed 13 c cases of cleft lip surgery. "I wholeheartedly welcome charity organisations to continue partnering with to offer the much-needed services," the mother said. Kenya Progressive Nurses Association national chairman Muhad Nyongesa said they are giving back to the community by offering free medical services. He said the free surgeries precede the annual general meeting of the organisation scheduled to be held in Garissa on Tuesday. Health CS Sicily Kariuki will be the chief guest. More than 600 nurses from across the country are expected to attend. Garissa Referral Hospital CEO Omar said health department officials are ready to partner and sustain similar free treatments.
