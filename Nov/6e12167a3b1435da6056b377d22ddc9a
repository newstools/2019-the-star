FKF National Super League (NSL) runaway leaders Nairobi City Stars will take on sixth-placed Ushuru tomorrow as the FKF National Super League enters matchday 14. The Kawangware- based side,  coached by Sanjin Alagic, enjoy a six-point lead on top of the log ahead of their game against the taxmen, who have been blowing hot and cold in the league. City Stars, who are sponsored by the Jonathan Jackson Foundation, are so far unbeaten in the league and will rely of Gambian hit-man Ebrahima Sanneh for goals against Ushuru when the team meet at Hope Center. Second-placed Nairobi Stima will be up against Kibera Black Stars in an early kick-off at Karuturi grounds. In the second game, Kenya Police will host Vihiga Bullets with coach Gregory Mutinda targeting a sixth win on the trot. “The win against Shabana at Gusii Stadium motivated the boys. We have had a good run and we want to continue with the same against Bullets,” said Mutinda. Third-placed Bidco United have a tricky trip away to Mombasa to face Coast Stima at Mbaraki Sports Club while fourth-placed Vihiga United will not be in action following the exclusion of Eldoret Youth from the league. Shabana FC will be at Kericho Green Stadium against Administration Police Bomet with coach Andrew Kanuli seeking to bounce back from the loss against Kenya Police. “The APS Bomet and the game against Nairobi Stima are must-wins at home. We have problems in some departs which we hope to strengthen when the mid-season opens in December,” said Kanuli. In other matches scheduled for tomorrow, Modern Coast Rangers will host Migori Youth at Serani Sports Ground as St Joseph’s Youth host Mt Kenya United at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru. Administration Police and Fortune Sacco will face off at Camp Toyoyo with Murang’a Seal entertaining FC Talanta at  Thika Stadium. Ends
