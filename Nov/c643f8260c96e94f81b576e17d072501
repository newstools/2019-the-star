Two Kilifi traffic police officers were on Friday arrested by Coast regional police commander Rashid Yakub for allegedly taking bribes. The officers were nabbed around Mavueni along the Mombasa-Malindi highway. Confirming the arrest, Yakub said he was driving to Malindi from Mombasa when he saw a matatu conductor dropping something for the police officers. “I stopped and picked whatever the conductor had dropped and I discovered it was a Sh100 note,” said Yakub. The regional police boss then drove the officers to the Kilifi police station where he ordered them locked up. The two officers, an inspector and a corporal, were later released on a police bail of Sh3, 000 each. The officers declined to speak to the media. Yakub said he will institute internal disciplinary measure on the officers. “We will handle the matter internally but if that does not work then we will have to arraign them,” he said. However, a senior police officer at the station said it would be hard to prosecute the case as it would be hard to establish whether the regional boss was not fixing the junior officers. “We do not know if the Sh100 came from the pocket of the regional boss or it was dropped by the matatu. Secondly, we dot know if the note dropped by the matatu was meant for the officers and why?” the officer said. The officer further accused the regional boss of exposing the rivalry between the Administration Police and the Kenya Police. “The regional commander is from the AP and I think he has hatred for the Kenya Police officers,” he added. In a recent survey by the EACC, police officers were ranked among the most corrupt officers in the country. The regional boss however said the officers will not be handed over to the EACC.
