The launch of Building Bridges Initiatives report at Bomas of Kenya is the climax of coming together of Raila Odinga and Uhuru Kenyatta to steer the country on a path of reconciliation and unity last year in March. They have demonstrated to be men who are ahead of their time and not leaders who only exist for short-term solutions and self-gain. They have the aspirations and desires of the millions of Kenya at heart to support the implementation of the report that is likely to herald a new start for a nation that has been divided by negative ethnicity for decades. They have committed themselves to achieve peace, stability and build a monument that is projected to bring success and prosperity. Kenyans want to get rid of corruption, negative ethnicity, politics of convenience and bad governance. The BBI report offers a redemptive chance if we desist from politicking. The handshake has shown meticulous and tireless spirit in their pursuit of nation-building often in the midst of chaos, violence and division that for years has led to the loss of lives and properties. Their coming together in pursuit of national healing is hope to be felt and experienced in every aspect of a Kenyanâ€™s life. We are a nation that is struggling to establish a functioning educational system, decent and affordable housing, enough security and safety, employment for the youthful population, medical care and a raise the standards of living. This quest is still ongoing. Kenyans can keep the dream of our founding fathers alive if we understand the content held by the launching of the BBI report. The best means to do this is to be fearless in pursuing our dreams and goals for ourselves, our businesses and for the country.  Political-governance activist
