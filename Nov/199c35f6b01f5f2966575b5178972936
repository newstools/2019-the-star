Kenya Karate Federation (KKF) will use the National Club Championship this weekend in Malindi to select 15 Karatekas for the African Championship set for February next year in Morocco. KKF have promised a free and fair selection during the two-day event that has attracted over 15 clubs and more than 150 karatekas (men and women). The event will also feature juniors. Federation's secretary-general Gabriel Mutuku said only karatekas who meet the required standards will be selected. Fitness levels will be key in the selection of the athletes. He said budgetary constraints have also forced them to reduce the number from the normal 32 to 15. "We want to have a strong contingent of 15 Karatekas for the continental tournament and therefore everybody will be given an equal chance. "We won't dwell on past records or recent history. Every competitor will have to justify why he deserves a slot. Fitness will be key in the selection," remarked Mutuku. The team is expected to start training immediately at Moi, Kasarani Gymnasium. "We want to get them physically strong and competitive," he added.
