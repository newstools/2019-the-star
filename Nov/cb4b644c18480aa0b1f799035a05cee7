The boda boda industry has turned into a monster. B oda boda riders now behave as lawless gangs openly breaking road rules in front of traffic police. In an accident they gang up and beat up, harass, rob, burn and even murder motorists whenever they are involved in an accident - whether at fault or not. Police Inspector General Hillary Mutyambai, the Ministry of Transport and the National Transport and Safety Authority must urgently tame the boda boda riders some of whom are known criminals. Tame them before they become a national threat.  Nairobi
