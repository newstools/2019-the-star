Thika Golf Club’s Simon Ngige played a round of 4-under par, 67, to open a six stroke lead at the summit of the Great Rift Valley Lodge & Golf resort leaderboard, to take his overall score to 4-under par, 209, heading into the final round of action. Ngige shot a total of six birdies and two bogeys, evenly distributed across the nines to take him six shots clear of Johnnie Walker-sponsored Dismas Indiza, who carded a round of 1-under par, 70, to take his gross score to 2-over par, 215, one ahead of Rwanda’s Alloys Nsabimana. The two started the round tied on fourth, alongside Railway Golf Club’s Alfred Nandwa. PGK captain CJ Wangai, who started the round in second, dropped three places to fifth after returning a round score of 4-over, 75, to take his overall tally to 5-over par 218. Nigeria’s Andrew Odoh, who was tied with Wangai after round two, carded a round score of 6-over par, 77, to see him finish the round in seventh place. Amateur Simon Njogu currently leads the race to the Silver Salver with a gross score of 4-over par, 217, in fourth position overall, five shots ahead of Daniel Nduva, who has lifted the amateur title thrice this season of the Safari Tour. It was a better scoring round than what was witnessed in the opening two rounds with five players recording scores of par or better, namely, including Ngige (4-under par), Njogu (2-under par), home pro Jastas Madoya and Indiza (1-under par) and Rwanda’s Nsabimana.
