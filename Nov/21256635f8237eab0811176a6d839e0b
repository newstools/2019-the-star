Chaos, teargas once again rocked the Nairobi County Assembly as police battled MCAs allied to Speaker Beatrice Elachi. A section of MCAs had attempted to forcefully eject Majority Leader Abdi Hassan Guyo from his office causing the fracas. The assembly is currently under heavy police presence after the MCAs fled to avoid the teargas. All MCAs and staff have been ordered to vacate the building. The pro-Elachi MCAs last week staged a coup to replace the Jubilee Party leadership. They wanted MCA Charles Thuo to replace Guyo and Nominated MCA June Ndegwa to replace Chege Waithera as the Chief Whip. Last week, there was drama at the assembly as rival city MCAs clashed over an impeachment motion of Elachi. Chaos broke shortly after MCAs supporting the new impeachment motion were disrupted by their counterparts while addressing the media. At some point, stones and water bottles were hurled at a section of the Jubilee MCAs forcing them to cut short their press conference. More to follow
