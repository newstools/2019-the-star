The Busia county assembly has mandated the Agriculture department to develop legislation to govern the operations of over 40 county abattoirs within six months. The MCAs acted on a report on the status of slaughterhouses and slabs which it adopted recently. The report called for the removal of the management of abattoirs from the department of Water, Irrigation, Environment and Natural Resources as per Governor Sospeter Ojaamong 2018 executive order. The assembly session was chaired by nominated MCA Nancy Okademi but the motion was moved by Agriculture committee chairman Joab Oteba. In its report, the committee decried the poor sanitation in the facilities and noted that most of them were not fenced, a factor that could lead to the grabbing of their land. Oteba said that the move to have the department of agriculture manage the slaughterhouses and slabs will solve land disputes and other challenges that had crippled their operations. “The department will be able to generate revenue for the county from the slaughterhouses operating in the county. The experts in the department will help in checking the spread of deadly diseases like anthrax through inspection of meat before being sold to the public,” he said. The MCA said that a livestock bill to help to streamline the livestock industry in the county is being developed.
