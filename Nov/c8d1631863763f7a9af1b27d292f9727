Is our country becoming a man eat man society? Has there been any vacuum in the government since Independence? Why is the government acting like it had gone on leave or had leaders taken a nap for a while and are suddenly awakening? First, it was meat laced with chemicals in our supermarkets and then came the peanut butter, high level of chemical presence in our vegetables, the school closures because of condemned buildings and now it has come to the staple food of the majority Kenyans, Ugali. The monitoring agencies are extremely becoming reactionary. Why have they allowed such messes to continue for this long yet they are being paid for the job? It is high time the government became active and cracked the whip on lax officials. We have had companies disseminating their wastes into rivers, poisoning the water we consume; unroadworthy vehicles on our even worse roads, poor ferry services that have caused deaths, several flight accidents from the same airline and scandalised seeds and fertilisers. We have also heard of fake doctors, counterfeit medicine and fake nursing homes, fake children’s homes run by predators who are after innocent boys and girls in the name of giving them a home. Slowly but surely we are going to poison and kill ourselves or end up using billions of money on treatment. Government agencies responsible need to come back from their slumberland and crack the whip before it’s too late. They should know that true victory lies in averting avoidable tragedies before they happen and that they won’t look like superheroes when they do what they are supposed to do. It is the government’s duty to keep its citizens alive as they are of no use without anyone to serve.  Kapenguria
