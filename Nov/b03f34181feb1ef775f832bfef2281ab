Limuru traders on Saturday held a protest against the judiciary for barring Governor Ferdinand Waititu from office. Waititu was charged in July with multiple offences including abuse of office and fraud and barred from accessing his office until the suit is determined. But the traders said restraining their governor from accessing his office was an infringement on their rights because his deputy James Nyoro does not have executive powers to perform some duties. Led by Margaret Muthoni, the traders said they do not want to interfere with the case facing Waititu, but he should be allowed some powers. Muthoni asked Chief Justice David Maraga and the supreme court to review the terms under which a governor must be barred from accessing their office. She said that in certain circumstances, a deputy must be granted temporary executive powers. "As of now, Kiambu is experiencing an issue that has never been witnessed in any county. A lot of projects such as market construction, roads, hospitals and other major projects have stalled," she said. John Gitau asked the government to allow traders to start operating in the half-constructed market, saying it stopped soon after Waititu was charged. "We do not know when the case will end. Until when shall we suffer? Our stock was destroyed by rains last month. The market has a roof but its not complete. We must be allowed to go in," Gitau said. Gitau said the locals have suffered since the judiciary restrained Waititu from handling his duties. "We had a lot of faith in him. He must be allowed to go to his office to do certain duties even if it is under supervision," he said. The protesters marched through the market streets, the town and ended at Bata Shoe Company gate.
