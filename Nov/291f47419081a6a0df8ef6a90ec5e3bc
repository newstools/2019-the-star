Murang’a residents who live in hilly areas have been warned of possible landslides as heavy rains continue to pound many parts of the county. Upper zones of the county especially areas which border Aberdare forests for the last four days have recorded more than 300 millimetres of rain. The county meteorology director Paul Murage has said the upper zones have received above-average rains thus residents need to move to safer places to avoid disasters. On Wednesday, several minor landslides were experienced in parts of Mathioya subcounty where property of unknown value was destroyed. In the incident, a house was destroyed and hundreds of tea bushes were swept away by a landslide. Murage told journalists on Saturday that soils are saturated thus making it possible for a landslide. “Upper zones including areas of Kigumo, Kahuro, Kangema, Kiariani and Kangari have for the last four days received heavy rains. We are advising our people to move to safer grounds if they can trace signs of a possible landslide at their home areas,” Murage said. Several roads, he added, were cut off by mudslide during the week but noted the county disaster committee is on the ground to assess the situation and provide help. The heavy rains, according to the meteorological department, are expected to continue till end of December. Murage termed the current rain season as the wettest saying since the onset of the short rains, some parts of the county have received more than 1,000 millimeters of rain. “In many rain seasons, the county receives about 700 millimetres,” he said. Residents of lower River Tana are on alert about possible floods as many areas of Mount Kenya region continue to experience heavy rains.
