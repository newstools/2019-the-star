President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to host Lesotho Prime Minister Motsoahae Thomas Thabane. Statehouse spokesperson Kanze Dena said Thabane will be in the country for a short state visit. According to her, Thabane will arrive in the country tomorrow morning before he is received at State House on Monday for a brief ceremony. "The two leaders will then proceed for a tête-à-tête before leading bilateral talks with their respective delegations," she said. In a statement to news rooms, Kanze Dena said Uhuru and Thabane will thereafter address a joint press briefing. Thabane made headlines in June 2017 when his wife was  shot dead two days before his inauguration. The wife, Lipolelo Thabane, 58, was travelling home with a friend when they were both shot dead by an unknown assailant. Police in Lesotho have since maintained that the motive for the attack is still unknown and an investigation is continuing.
