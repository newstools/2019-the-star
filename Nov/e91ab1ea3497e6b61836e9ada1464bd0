Kenya Cup champions KCB will be the services of dependable duo of Andrew Amonde and Jacob Ojee in Saturday's top of the table clash against Kabras at the Lions Den in Ruaraka. Assistant coach Dennis Mwanja said the duo will be with the national team for the opening legs of the World Sevens Series in Dubai and Cape Town starting this weekend. They will be replaced by Rocky Aguko and Issac Njoroge for the eagerly anticipated clash. KCB and Kabras are joint top on 25 points after five matches. Since promotion to the top flight, Kabras are yet to beat the bankers in 10 league meetings, losing four Kenya Cup finals to their rivals. The two are the only unbeaten sides in the league this far. Mwanja said their narrow 27-24 win over Homeboyz over the weekend was a wake-up call to his charges ahead of the big showdown. "We were a bit casual in our approach. We took some things for granted but still survived. We must step up for our game against Kabras,” noted Mwanja. The bankers trailed 14-8 at the interval before turning around in the second half. Mwanja said his charges struggled in the absence of injured skipper Curtis Lilako and prop Moses Amusala. "We had rookie props and got bullied in set-pieces but I hope Lilako and Amusala can train this week in readiness for the weekend clash," said Mwanja. He said playing at home will give them an advantage. The bankers have only lost once at home in the past four seasons — to Nondies last year — and the tactician observed that its a big motivation for them. "Playing at home is plus for us and if we correct our errors, we will be difficult to beat," added Mwanja. In other weekend results, Quins moved off the bottom of the table with a 25-15 victory over Menengai Oilers, Nakuru edged Western Bulls 23-10, Impala thrashed Kisumu 41-5 as Kabras edged Blak Blad 57-3 as Mwamba beat Nondies 27-17.
