 The Kisii government will use the Sh203 million grant from the Kenya Roads Board to build footbridges, develop village roads and improve drainage works. Governor James Ongwae on Tuesday said his administration is committed to improving infrastructure because it is key for development. “In order to receive potential investors, my administration will continue investing in road infrastructure across the county,” Ongwae told the Star on the phone. He said Kisii, by being a member of the Lake Region Economic Block, has access to a large market of an estimated 14 million residents which can be tapped into a good road network. “I am happy with the progress in implementation of the Ahero-Isebania road which transverses the county, once completed, the modern road will boost connectivity to the lake region and open up Kisii through the construction of by-pass roads of supportive infrastructure,” Ongwae said. Among the by-pass roads to be built include the Suneka-Riana-Rodi, Nyamataro-Daraja Moja, Oyugis-Gamba, Nyachenge-Ogembo-Ikoba and St. Stephen-Christa Marriane which is under construction. Ongwae said they were building and upgrading new roads to motorable status through the Mechanical Transport Fund. “By the close of the last financial year, we had opened 603km of roads across the county. This year, we shall build to gravel 250km of access roads, 135 km of village roads, and maintain 400 km of roads under the Fuel Levy programme,” the governor said.  edited by peter obuya
