National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK) President Paul Tergat received the Achilles Prize at the International Athletics Film Festival (FICA) in the Spanish city of San Sebastian on Tuesday for his cross country domination, particularly in the Basque city. Tergat, a five-time world cross country champion as well as an Olympic 10,000m silver medalist and former marathon record holder, received a trophy and was also presented with a ceremonial inscribed Basque beret— a txapela —a traditional gift in the area. “It’s a big honour to be recognised in this manner and this honour is very special to me,” commented Tergat. “I hope this type of event (FICA) will continue for many years. To see the film of my cross country victories as well as my defeats on the track at the Olympics brings it all back to me even though it was 20 years ago, and more. But it’s important to keep these memories for our children and grandchildren. The NOC-K president was a winner of several cross country races in the Basque region during the second half of the 1990s when he reigned supreme in the discipline. Tergat was a popular figure in this part of Spain during his competitive career and the reception he received when he came on stage at the Teatro Principal showed that his stature had not dimmed with the local athletics fans.
