The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has summoned the entire Cabinet of Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko to record statements. Five other officials will also record statements, according to EACC's letter dated November 15, 2019. "Further kindly inform and facilitate the release of the following county officials who have served or are still serving in these positions for interview and statement recording at our offices located at Integrity centre, Nairobi," reads the letter. EACC Deputy Director for Forensic Investigation John Kolkoloi addressed the letter to the County Secretary of Nairobi. Those summoned on Tuesday next week are head of CEC secretariat Joyce Kinyanjui, administration office's Samwel Kinyanjui, chief of staff Peter Mugo and deputy county secretary Leboo Ole Morintat. Former acting county attorney Christine Ireri, CEC for Finance Winfred Gathangu, CEC for Devolution Lary Wambua and suspended CEC for Health Mohammed Dagane will appear on November 20, 2019. On November 21, CEC Roads Hitan Majevdia will appear before EACC alongside CEC Water and Environment Vesca Kagongo, CEC for Trade Allan Igambi and CEC for Education Lucia Mulwa. Suspended CEC for Finance Charles Kerich, CEC for Agriculture Pauline Kahiga and CEC for ICT Newton Munene will appear on November 22. The officials are required to carry certified copies of letter of appointment and the county Executive Committee Memoranda No 1 -4 of 2019. EACC have also requested that the officials submit Agenda Notices for County executive Committee Meetings No 5 to 7 of 2019 and minutes of the 5th and 6th meetings of Nairobi City County Executive Committee. However, Governor Sonko replied and said that the letter from EACC was untenable for compliance. "Your notice is too short and not convenient since prior arrangements to comply is not feasible. All officials are already engaged out of Nairobi in a budget committee meeting and there fore the notice is untenable for compliance," he said.
