The last Nakumatt outlet in Kisumu has closed down and former employees demanding arrears of close to Sh2 million. The management packed all the goods in trolleys at the Mega City branch on the Kisumu-Nairobi highway. Yesterday, the management declined to speak to the press as they were holed up in a meeting with security officers. About 32 workers who have been at the store are demanding that the management settles their salary arrears. The former employees have blocked the transfer of stock from Kisumu to Nairobi for the past six days demanding their money. They claimed they were not informed about the intended closure. The workers said police officers were called in on Tuesday as the packed goods were loaded onto trucks but they blocked the bid to have the goods moved out of the store. Chief supervisor Micholo Ochieng' said they were surprised last Thursday when the management told them not to open the store to customers. Ocheing told the media that they wanted to know when and how their dues will be paid, adding that they are not against the closing of the store. “We have sought for help from labour offices in Kisumu who have in turn summoned the management and directed them to pay the workers before winding up,”he said. One of the workers at the outlet for the last 22 years wondered why the management was in a hurry to kick them out yet there contracts were expiring in January next year. “We are appealing to the government to intervene and help us get our payments for this years that we have worked for this facility,”said Mildred Atieno.
