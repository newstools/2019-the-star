Police in Machakos have launched investigations into suspected suicide of a  17-year-old boy and a 39-year-old man on Monday. Stephen Makau from Kawathei village in Kangundo subcounty is said to have killed himself after setting his house on fire. Kangundo police commander Benjamin Ong’ombe said Makau was said to have had an argument with his ex-wife. He reportedly tried to assault her but neighbours managed to rescue her. "They lived in separate houses in Kawathei trading centre. The woman went to visit a friend and when she came back to her house, her former husband tried assaulting her but their neighbors were able to separate them", Ong’ombe said. He said the man went straight to his house and hanged himself after setting his house a blaze. Ong’ombe said police were yet to unravel the reason why the man chose to end his life. His body was moved to Kangundo referral hospital mortuary. At the same time police Kathiani are probing the death of a teenage boy said to have committed suicide on Monday. The body of the deceased was discovered on Tuesday morning by his family after they got suspicious over his whereabouts. The boy is said to have gone missing on Monday afternoon. His body was found hanging from a tree in a nearby thicket. The body was taken to Machakos Level 5 Hospital mortuary. Ong’ombe appealed to Kenyans to speak out about their problems to friends, relatives and religious leaders to avoid resorting to taking their own lives.
