The two-year contracts of Mombasa's 10 county executives expired on Tuesday, leaving the administration without substantive top officials. Sources within the Mombasa county indicate that all the 10 CECs have now handed over to the chief officers in their docket, waiting for Governor Hassan Joho’s next action. Joho, who is serving his second and last term in office, gave the CECs the contracts on November 12, 2017. Some of the CECs have served in the administration since 2013 when Joho was first elected governor. According to reports, Joho has asked all the CECs to report on their performance and achievements in the two years they have served. Some CECs will be re-appointed, but some might be forced to go home based on their performance, said a senior official within Joho’s office. Any new nominees will have to be vetted by the county assembly. County chief of staff Joab Tumbo confirmed that contracts of the 10 CECs had come to an end and Joho is expected to make changes in the coming few weeks. Residents are anxious that the departure of the 10 CECs will hamper service delivery at the county government. However, Tumbo said the chief officers in the department will continue to hold the offices until the next Cabinet comes into place. The chief officers also signed a two-contract, which is also expected to come to an end in February 2020. Joho is expected to ensure that the new CECs are appointed as soon as possible. “There is no crisis, because cabinet changes are very normal. They do happen in any government,” Tumbo said.
