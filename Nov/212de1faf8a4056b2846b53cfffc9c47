A woman was found murdered in her car at the Mwingi stocks market on Monday. Mwingi Central subcounty administrator Alex Mutemi said the body was identified as that of Eunice Kiema from Kyuso, Mwingi North. She was, however, born in Mui, Mwingi Central. “We woke up this morning to the sad news of the loss of one of the tutors, a clinical officer at KMTC, Mwingi, through brutal murder,” he said. Her eyes were gouged out, part of the legs burnt and several parts had stab wounds. The body was taken to a mortuary. Mwingi Central subcounty police commander Peter Mutuma said his team together with DCI officers had begun investigations. "The suspect seems to have had intentions to also torch the car, Toyota Raum with registration KCJ 451B,  which was grey in colour. A matchbox was found at the scene,” Mutuma said. Residents urged the police to beef up security in Mwingi town. Ndanu Kimanzi termed it "very humiliating" to lose life to heartless individuals. He called for increased day and night police patrols in the area. “It deeply hurts to see a woman being killed in this cruel way, yet we have police officers in Mwingi. We want them to ensure every part of the town is safe,” he said as he wiped his tears. Another resident who identified himself as Ras called for the deployment of more officers. He said Mwingi has been peaceful and no one should be allowed to cause fear. He urged residents to work with security officers to secure the place. Joe Nyange said Eunice was a peaceful woman who was mostly spotted in her mother’s company. She said Eunice was friendly and described her death as horrifying and painful. “Everyone in Mwingi knew Eunice to be very humble and peace-loving. May the arm of the law extend and catch those who did this terrifying act for justice to prevail,” he said. He said a man was killed late last year a few metres from the spot.
