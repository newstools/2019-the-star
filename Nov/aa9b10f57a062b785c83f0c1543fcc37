A family at Donyo in South Mugirango in Kisii is in mourning after their daughter, a candidate in the ongoing KCSE examinations died after a short illness. Mary Nyantoera, 17, fell ill Wednesday while sitting her examination at Ndonyo Secondary School. She died on Saturday evening at Tabaka Mission Hospital where she was transferred to for treatment. A teacher at the school told the Star the student had developed swelling on her legs and experienced chest pains before she was taken to the nearby Etago Dispensary for treatment. Her situation, however, worsened and teachers contacted the parents who came and transferred her to Tabaka Mission Hospital where she succumbed. "Though feeling unwell, she struggled all through and even did the Friday afternoon paper," the school said. Teachers said they suspected the candidate suffered a sudden bout of tuberculosis. "It appeared like a sudden bout of TB though only a health report can tell us correctly what ailed her," a senior teacher at the school said. The principal was not present when the Star visited the school late Sunday. The candidate's father Alfred Nyatoera said her daughter had not been sick neither had she exhibited any signs of ailment when she began writing the examinations. "She has been well. We only learnt of her sudden sickness on Thursday and took her to hospital. She only began breathing heavily on Friday night and her legs swelled more before passed on Saturday evening, " Nyantoera said. He said efforts to apply liniments on her swelling legs bore no fruits.
