An investigating officer from Lang’ata police station left everyone in stitches after he told a Nairobi court that he spent good memories with a female suspect before he arrested her. The energetic and muscular officer told the female suspect that his memories with her were good and admirable. “I feel like rotating a long tail in the air so that me, you and the court can witness how our memories were. You are a good suspect to deal with. I know you very well and I was the one who arrested you,” he said. "You remember, too. Isn’t it so madam ?” he asked her. He said that the suspect was “amazing” during the time of arrest. At first, he seemed cool, wise and a respected old man in society but when he hurled insults to a middle-aged man, everyone laughed and thought otherwise. Things fell apart after the accused started greeting his former boss. "Boss habari ya leo. Nakuona kotini,” the suspect said. The boss replied, “You are stupid, you young man. I was born before your mother n and you are stupid like your mother. Don’t great me, whom do you think you are,” he roared. He told him he has made his life very difficult and he needed no more greetings from him. “You must know the government is looking for me day and night. I am suffering because of you. Better shut up,” he barked. The magistrate was forced to intervene to solve the matter.“Mzee, cool down and narrate to us what happened. Prosecutor, kindly don’t bring such a witness to court,” the magistrate said. A man caused drama at a Uasin Gishu court after he requested the court to assist him get some bread and tea before he proceeds with a case.“I have not eaten anything and I can die before the case comes to a conclusion. Why can’t you make an arrangement so that I get some food to eat,” he told the court. The magistrate thought that the suspect was mad but when his drama proceeded, he ordered him to be given some food so that he can proceed with the case.
