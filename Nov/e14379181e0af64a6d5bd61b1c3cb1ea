Two KCSE candidates in Vihiga are sitting their exam in hospital after they were admitted with labour pains. County education director Hellen Nyangáu yesterday said Vihiga had two pregnancy cases in Sabatia and Luanda subcounties. "The two candidates are currently taking their tests in labour rooms. We expect the one in Luanda subcounty to be discharged any time from now," she told The Star on the phone. "We also had one candidate from Budaywa Secondary admitted to Kakamega General Hospital for kidney problem but she is sitting her exam too." Nyangáu said the exam had not faced any hindrance since it began on Monday. She urged parents and teachers to cooperate and comply with regulations so candidates can take the tests without problems. The government has warned that any person found engaging in malpractices will be prosecuted. State officials are part of the team that has been dispatched by the government to monitor the exam. They are led by Education CS George Magoha and regional administration officials. They have been to different parts of the country to ensure all exam regulations are complied with.
