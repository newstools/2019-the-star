Tea factories in Bomet and Kericho shared a total of Sh15.85 billion from 69million kilos made from tea sales this year. Out of this, Sh10 billion was paid directly to the small scale tea farmers from the two counties as initial and final payments. Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) said farmers from 14 factories under region five in the two counties fetched up to Sh5.07 billion in the tea bonuses paid out this month. In a statement, the agency said Bomet farmers earned a total of Sh3.11 billion since they had already been paid Sh3.04billion as initial payment while those in Kericho raked in Sh1.96 in bonus after receiving Sh1.86 billion as initial pay. In Bomet, KTDA says, 42.6 million kilos of made tea was sold while in Kericho 26.6 million kilos waw sold. The performance, Kapkoros tea factory board chairman Eric Langat, says was realized even at a time when tea producing countries in the world have registered an increased production while importing markets have experienced political and economic challenges. He spoke during an annual general meeting at Tirgaga tea factory in Bomet on Wednesday. He further called on the government and political leaders to support in ensuring the green tea leaves hawked by farmers along the roads ‘mang’irito’ and poor road networks which he said have contributed to poor tea prices are addressed. He said many farmers earned a little on bonus because they had sold much of their produce to private factories which pay little amounts and offer no bonus compared to   KTDA.
