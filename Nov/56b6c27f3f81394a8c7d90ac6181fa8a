Universal Healthcare Coverage is one of President Uhuru Kenyatta's four pillars in his legacy plan. But this pillar seems destined to fail if drastic measures are not put in place to correct the inherent dismal management shortcomings. The national health insurer has, for instance, remained in the eye of the storm for, among other things, "robbing the poor to finance the treatment of the rich overseas and in local high-end facilities". Woe unto the poor when seeking treatment using their NHIF cards.Â  Several cases were reported last week of cancer patients yet to be treated at a new health parastatal because the NHIF is yet to approve their pre-authorisation applications. Yet the approval should take not more than 24 hours. Some of the patients are terminal and referral cases. The NHIF should be held responsible should they die due to the health insurer's dilly-dallying. Delay in cancer diagnosis and treatment must not be factors of consideration for fully paid members of the NHIF. It is already worrying enough that cancer kills 33,000 Kenyans every year. The actualisation of the UHC is a matter that should be taken seriously by players in the health sector. Failure to do so amounts to sabotage of the President's legacy plan and Kenyans' health anticipation.
