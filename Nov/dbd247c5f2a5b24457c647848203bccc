Sirisia residents have demanded that the Bungoma administration upgrades the constituency into a municipality. They have also opposed the hiving of Namwela ward in the constituency to form part of a proposed Chwele municipality. The residents spoke during a review of boundaries for the new Chwele municipality which is being considered after Governor Wycliffe Wangamati directed the Urban Planning executive to provide funds for the upgrade. Namwela MCA Charles Nangulu has supported the decision to join Chwele amid much criticism from the residents. They said the public participation forum held at Chwele Musese CDF Hall was done with a select group of people to force the outcome. “Public participation means listening to the people's will but unfortunately the county leadership wants to force things on us,” Japheth Wataka, a resident, said. Area MP John Waluke has termed the move an injustice of the highest order to residents of his constituency. “We are demanding that Sirisia becomes a municipality but we will not allow Namwela to be hived off because this will be contrary to peoples wishes,” Waluke said. The lawmaker urged the county government to consider the views of Sirisia people in development matters because they are also legitimate residents of Bungoma. The county has finalised the upgrade of Kimilili and Bungoma town to municipalities with funding from the World Bank. In the last financial year, Kimilili and Bungoma municipalities received Sh191 million and Sh110 million respectively to tarmac several roads. Residents have held demonstrations calling upon the county government to listen to their call and give Siria a municipality to enjoy privileges that come with it. (edited by O. Owino)
