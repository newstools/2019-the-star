President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday received the Building Bridges Initiative taskforce report. The handover was made at State House in the presence of opposition leader Raila Odinga, Deputy President William Ruto and the leadership of Parliament. The details of the report will be released to the public on Wednesday at The Bomas of Kenya The taskforce chairman senator Yusuf HajiÂ last week said the report covers all the views the team collected across the country. Haji added that the taskforce was able to collect views from more than 400 elected leaders and Kenyans in the 47 counties. Earlier on it had been said the handing over of the report would be postponed over the death of 43 people in West Pokot. The BBI report was to be presented to President Uhuru Kenyatta at 1pm. But by 3pm the report had not reached State House raising speculations around the report. As part of his strategy to bring down political temperatures, Uhuru convened a major meeting at the Bomas of Kenya on Wednesday where the report will be officially released to the public. The head of state has invited about 100 leaders from each of the 47 counties to Bomas, sending a clear signal that he is not taking lightly the BBI process. The report whose objective was to, among other things, resolve ethnic animosity has stirred political temperatures and threatened to split the country. The handshake has degenerated into a political contest between Ruto and Raila with the 2022 polls fast approaching.
