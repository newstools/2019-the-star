It seems some MPs are unaware of Standing Orders despite being in the House for over two years. Well, it could be a problem of the countryâ€™s poor reading culture. This was the case of a first-time lawmaker who insisted on donating her time to a colleague, citing her state of being emotional. Her colleagues were overheard saying after the session that they will take the lawmaker through a lesson on the Standing Orders, clause by clause, in the art of entrenching the culture of reading in Parliament. With the Ethics and Anti- Corruption Commission tightening the noose on corruption officials, a governor and a member of county executive in one of the South Rift counties are worried men. The sleuths from the commission are said to have strained their eyes on them after it emerged that they may have colluded to siphoned taxpayers money in fishy deals that have seen them become overnight millionaires. According to those in the know, it is only a matter of time before the two are arrested. A governor from Western Kenya shocked a social media group with his reply to a member who had asked a question. The resident had asked why there was no money in circulation in the devolved unit. In his response to the group, the governor told the resident that there was sufficient cash flow in the county and it was only him who was broke. The governor asked the resident to speak for himself since not everybody in the county was as broke as him. The resident had complained that there was no money in circulation because all contractors hired by the county came from regions outside the devolved unit.
