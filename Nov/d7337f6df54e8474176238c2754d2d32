Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has been cautioned against taking the three Ukambani governors’ rising political clout for granted. Kitui county assembly minority leader Alex Nganga and Maendeleo  Chap Chap secretary general Stephen Kilonzo said Kalonzo can only write off governors Alfred Mutua (Machakos), Charity Ngilu (Kitui) and Kivutha Kibwana of Makueni at his peril. “It is becoming increasingly evident that former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka cannot ignore governors Ngilu, Mutua and Kibwana and hope to maintain the Kamba Kingpin status,” Nganga said in a statement on Sunday. In a separate statement, Kilonzo said through their involvement in successful ODM campaigns in the just-concluded Kibra by-election, Ngilu, Kibwana and Mutua sent a strong political message ahead of 2022 election. “Politics is about perception and from October 17 Mutonguni ward by-election in Kitui county where Wiper lost to Kibra constituency, we are staring at a paradigm shift in Ukambani politics,” Nganga said. The Wiper party seems to be losing popularity in Ukambani region with Mutua's Maendeleo Chap Chap and Ngilu's Narc and other parties gaining popularity steadily in the region and national politics, Kilonzo said.
