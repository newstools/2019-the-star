Jubilee's party candidate McDonald Mariga arrived at Lindi Mosque polling station to show support, as people of Kibra vote for their next MP. Mariga is not a Kibra registered voter. Mariga was seen posing for photos with voters as he greeted them with a smile on his face. A distraught Mariga early September left the IEBC nomination hall unclear on whether he would get into the ballot for the November 7 Kibra by-election. For a man who was just getting to learn how to navigate political waters, a visibly shocked Mariga was informed that his name was missing in the voter register. IEBC returning officer Beatrice Muli told the former Harambee Stars player that his name did not show up either in the manual register nor in the IEBC Electronic Voter Identification system. He lodged an appeal with the IEBC for a chance to face off with 23 other candidates in the by-election. The IEBC Dispute Resolution Committee on Sept 16 cleared him to vie for the Kibra by-election after Starehe Registration officer Ismael Yassin confirmed that Mariga was indeed a registered voter. In a Facebook post shared by Mariga on Thursday, he has appealed to voters to come out in large numbers and vote for him. "Today is the time you decide your next leadership. Vote Me, Vote Change," reads part of his Facebook post. He further thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto for their support all through his campaign. "Thanks, Uhuru, Thanks Ruto and Most importantly thanks to all Kibrans," he said. ODM's Bernard Okoth, Ken's brother, faces Jubilee's McDonald Mariga, an ex-football star and Eliud Owalo of ANC. Twenty-four candidates are on the ballot. The poll is being overseen by 188 presiding officers and 625 clerks. There are 118,658 voters listed on the IEBC roll.
