Jubilee aspirant McDonald Mariga has said that IEBC should find a way to enable Kenyans living abroad to register and vote. He has said that more than one million people living in diaspora have been denied the opportunity to participate in elections. Mariga said he was also not allowed to register because for a long time he  was playing International soccer abroad. IEBC had  barred him from presenting his nomination papers after the last-minute discovery that his name was missing from list of registered voters. He is a registered voter in Starehe constituency and therefore cannot cast his vote in Kibra. Mariga who has been making rounds in different polling stations in Kibra "to show solidarity" has said that he is confident to win. "All we want is peace. I know IEBC will do their work. I'm very confident we will win," he said. He said police officers are on standby to deal with goons who try to cause chaos and scare women from casting their votes. He disregarded claims that one of his supporter had attempted to bribe voters saying he has not received that information. ODM's Bernard Okoth, Ken's brother, faces Jubilee's McDonald Mariga, an ex-football star and Eliud Owalo of ANC. Twenty-four candidates are on the ballot. The poll is being overseen by 188 presiding officers and 625 clerks. There are 118,658 voters listed on the IEBC roll.
