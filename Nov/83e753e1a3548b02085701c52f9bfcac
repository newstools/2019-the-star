Deputy President William Ruto has congratulated Kibra MP-elect Bernard 'Imran' Okoth after being officially declared the winner by IEBC. Through the tweet, Ruto congratulated the Jubilee candidate McDonald Mariga and Jubilee's team for daring what he termed as 'Raila's bedroom'. The 'bedroom' phrase has been used by Raila and his party in describing Kibra as his stronghold. Ruto went further to say the Jubilee Party had managed to double their support in Kibra in the concluded by-election to 26%  compared to 12% which they registered during the 2017 general election. The DP also said the party used the by-election to serve notice to the dominant ODM party in the area despite the defeat. Results from the 183 polling stations showed Imran secured victory with 24, 636 votes with Mariga coming in second with 11, 230 votes. ANC's Eliud Owalo came in third with 5, 275 votes with Ford Kenya's Khamisi Butichi coming in a distant fourth with 260 votes. The total votes cast was 41, 984 against a registered number 118, 658 votes representing a 35.38% voter turnout.
