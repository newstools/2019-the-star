Ross Field will defend his title in the championship-winning CRT machine in the 2020 Kenya National Rally Raid Championship. Field successfully defended his crown after finishing third overall in the weekend’s Sosian Rally Raid, the final round of the 2019 championship. This is now the third title in his Century Racing CRT besides his previous titles on a bike. “For 2020, we will use the same car and look forward to another great year of competition between myself and Mark Glen as well as Mike Rose, Flash Tundo, Gray Cullen, Ian Duncan and Alister Keith.” “We have had a great raid season in amazing locations including Naivasha, Timau, Mai Mahiu and Sosian. We have been fortunate enough to win the 2019 overall championship and modified class championship. Our sponsor Specialised Fibreglass provided a faultless car. Without them, it would not have been possible,” Ross added. “My navigator Quentin Savage deserves huge credit. Special thanks also to Shaun Miller who steps in as navigator every time Quentin decides to have another baby,” he noted. The two-day raid held on Sosian Ranch for the first time offered the crews a mixture of terrain, from fast-flowing roads to bush tracks, challenging sideshows and even a number of daunting river crossings. Jon Bovard led at the end of day one but was overhauled by Mark Glen and Robbie Calder on the second day. Shivam Vinayak took the bike championship with a dominant win in his class along with an overall podium whilst Field and Quentin Savage came home third overall.
