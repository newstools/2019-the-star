A Mandera court on Wednesday remanded a man accused of terrorism for two days pending police investigations. Abdikadir Noor is accused of entering Kenya from Somalia on November 11 through an undesignated entry point at border point three near Mandera town. Police constable Elijah Nakees attached to the Mandera Anti-Terror Police Unit in an affidavit said Noor entered the country illegally. Noor, although possessing a Kenyan identity card, is reported to have been in Somalia from 2015 to 2019. Nakees told the court the accused claimed to have been working in Somalia as a translator with the United States forces offering military training to the Somalian army. Noor was found with Somalia network Hormud and Somnet sim cards. The court was told the accused was found in possession of military training schedules including types of firearms and military techniques. The ATPU said the man was dangerous to the security of the country and wants to ascertain whether he has been involved in any terror activities. Senior resident magistrate Kimani Mukabi gave the ATPU 48 hours to conclude investigations. "I have listened to the ATPU prayer of seven days to conclude investigations and considered the interests of the accused and given 48 hours for the investigations to be concluded," Mukabi ruled. Noor will spend the two days at the Mandera police station after visiting the Mandera County Hospital for treatment as directed by the magistrate. The case comes up for mention today. Meanwhile, Governor Ali Roba has praised wananchi, the security apparatus and the courts for their cooperation in the fight against terrorism. Roba whose county has borne the brunt of the Somali-based militants said every person has a role to play both individually and collectively. Speaking in Mandera town on Wednesday, Roba said that past terror experiences have only served to make the residents, stronger, more alert and united in the fight against terrorism.
