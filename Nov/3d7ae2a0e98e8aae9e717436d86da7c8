Former AG and Busia Senator Amos Wako has been barred from travelling to the United States for what the US Department of State has described as involvement in significant corruption. This announcement was made on Monday evening under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2019 (Div. F, P.L. 116-6), as carried forward by the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020 (Div. A, P.L. 116-59). "Section 7031(c) provides that, in cases where the Secretary of State has credible information that officials of foreign governments have been involved in significant corruption, those individuals and their immediate family members are ineligible for entry into the United States," US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said. The letter further states that the law also requires the Secretary of State to publicly or privately designate such officials and their immediate family members. In addition to Wako being barred, the Department has also blocked Wako’s wife, Flora Ngaira, and their son. "Today’s action sends a strong signal that the United States is a valuable partner in Kenya’s fight against corruption. The United States will continue to stand with all Kenyans as they strive to curb and punish corruption in Kenya.," the statement read. Efforts to reach Wako for comment  were unsuccessful as his phone was off. Wako was banned from entering the US in 2009 and threatened legal action against the US. US Ambassador Kyle McCarter has previously said individuals implicated in graft will not be allowed to enter the US.
