The KCSE exams came to a close on Wednesday with the Education ministry reporting 21 centres cheated. The test comes to a close 24 days after it started. This year, a total of 669,745 sat the exam that began on November 4. Many of those sitting this year's exam took their final test last Friday, leaving only those with the technical subjects of woodwork, mechanics, home science among others behind. The end of the exam will give way for the marking exercise expected to begin in a week’s time and projected to last less than a month. Education CS George Magoha also revealed that 90 phones were confiscated during the the three-week period over cases of exam malpractice. "There was no cheating in terms of early leakages but 300 schools were in our radar,” Magoha said. He cited Eastleigh in Nairobi, Kisii, Migori, Homa Bay, Wajir and Garissa as areas of concern. He singled out two cases as more serious than the rest. The CS was flanked by Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang, Knec acting chief executive Mercy Karogo and Teachers Service Commission CEO Nancy Macharia. Magoha said results will be released before Christmas. He said there were few cases of people collecting money to sell exam papers. Karogo said at least 33,000 teachers will mark the exams. “All plans are in place to begin the marking exercise and the candidates should expect their results before Christmas just like last year,” she said on the phone. In first two weeks of the exam, 45 people were arrested in connection to exam malpractice. Also, 35 phones were confiscated in the same period. Last year, the results of 100 candidates were cancelled over cheating. A total of 14 teachers were also sacked by the Teachers Service Commission over links of exam malpractice.
