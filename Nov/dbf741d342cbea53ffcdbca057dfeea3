Paralympic rower Asiya Sururu will train in France and Portugal in readiness for the Tokyo Olympic Games next year. Sururu qualified to represent the country after finishing first in the qualifiers held last month in Tunisia. She beat 10 other contestants from the continent to book her ticket to the global extravaganza in Japan next year. She explained that the two countries have good locations to train for the rowing ahead of the games. “The locations to train have already been identified and with the support of Nock who have my training programme,  it will give me the chance to enjoy the best facilities. This will also give me a chance to be competitive during the games, ” added Sururu She said she has set her sights on winning a medal at the Olympic Games.  “Winning the event has given me a big boost and I have now set my sight on winning a medal in Tokyo," she added. To that effect, Sururu has stepped her preparations by training in Mombasa at the Tudor Waterfront for the remainder of the year before shifting to her training to Europe next year. Though it will be her first time competing at the Olympics,  Sururu is unfazed competing against top rowers from Norway, Britain and Israel. " I'm not scared of facing the competition. It will be good for me and good for my career," she added. Sururu has called on government and corporates to support the sport, revealing that she had to borrow a uniform from able-bodied competitors for the Tunisia qualifiers. "I am asking the government to help these minor sports and federations. If we are well funded like the rest, we can do the country proud," she added.
