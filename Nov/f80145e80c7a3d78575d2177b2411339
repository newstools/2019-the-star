George Njao has been appointed as the National Transport and Safety Authority director general for a period of three years after a vigorous interview process. Njao takes over from Francis Meja, who completed his three-year contract. Before his appointment in 2016, Meja was the Registrar of Motor Vehicles. In a press statement on Tuesday by acting NTSA chairperson Alice Chesire, the board said it had settled on Njao, who has more than 15 years of experience in the transport sector. He holds a Master’s degree and a Bachelor of Science degree from Central Missouri State University, USA. The board said Meja was instrumental in setting up NTSA and taking up several mandates previously assigned to various agencies such as KRA. The board has also appointed Badu Katelo as the director of road safety, Christopher Wanjau as the director of registration and licensing and Shalakha Shem as the deputy director of supply chain management. NTSA board has lauded outgoing director general for his leadership and commitment in the implementation of the authority’s mandate.
