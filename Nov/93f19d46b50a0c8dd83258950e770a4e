The father of the alleged stowaway has now come out to deny claims the man identified as Paul Manyasi is his son. Isaac Manyasi had told Sky News in an exclusive investigative segment , that they had not heard from his son Paul for the longest time. Paul was Isaac's eldest son and he and his wife Janet had not heard from him since the beginning of July. But speaking to KTN News on Wednesday, Isaac denied that Paul was his son. "Sio kijana wangu.Niliwaambia ile picha walinionyesha sio ya mtoto wangu. Kijana wangu alitoka hapa 2016 akaenda Nairobi," Isaac said. Isaac who hails from Kakamega said since July 2017 he has not spoken to his son adding that Sky news interviewed him on the same. "I am surprised, I will tell the police because my son is alive...niliambiwa na kijana mmoja ati kijana wangu ako industrial area police remand," he said. He added that his son was not called Paul Manyasi but Isaac Cedric. "I am even planning to leave this Friday for Nairobi," he said. From the Sky News video, Isaac identified that the bag, the sports shoes, a pair of red underwear belonged to Paul. According to the UK-based media, the man whose frozen body dropped off from a landing KQ plane into a garden in an affluent Southern London suburb on June 30 this year, was identified and his parents traced. With a ground-shaking thud, the body fell when the plane released its wheels for landing at Heathrow, almost hitting a man lying on a sun lounge and reading a book. He fell about 3,500 feet and his body left a crater. The Kenya Airports Authority KAA dismissed claims that the stowaway who fell in a London garden was a cleaner at the JKIA. In a statement on Tuesday, KAA said in collaboration with teams from multiple agencies, had conducted investigations with regards to the allegations and established that they were "baseless". Colnet company which provides its services at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport has also denied claims that the alleged stowaway was one of their staff.
