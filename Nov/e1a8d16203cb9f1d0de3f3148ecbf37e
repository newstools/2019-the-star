President Uhuru Kenyatta has fired a salvo at the Judiciary, a day after Chief Justice David Maraga's  outburst. Maraga on Monday said he would choose which State functions to attend until he is given the respect he deserves. But speaking on Tuesday in Nairobi, Uhuru urged the Judiciary to expedite cases in court 'if it so wishes'. "I call on the Judiciary, if they so desire, to strive to determine expeditiously tax disputes without fear or favour," he said amid laughter. "We now have a Tax Appeals Tribunal and I want a report in three months on what has been done to expedite those cases and we want them done ." Uhuru said the majority of the cases had been pending for many years. An angry Maraga, in a televised address to the nation from the steps of the Supreme Court, alleged there was a plot by the Executive to kick him out of office before the end of the year. “Some CSs are saying I will go before the year ends. Kumbe hii Kenya ina wenyewe (apparently Kenya has its owners)?" Judge Maraga said, flashing a wry smile intermittently. Senior judges told the Star on Monday the Cabinet Secretaries are unhappy that Maraga has refused to dance to their tune.
