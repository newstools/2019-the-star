Kisii University hope to lift the Kenya Universities Sports Association  (KUSA) Western Conference title for the 11th consecutive time at Kaimosi Friends University College in Vihiga County this weekend. Kisii University's games tutor David Obungu exuded confidence that his team will lift the title once again despite playing away from home.  “We have a better team than the previous years and we are going to Kaimosi to defend our title,” Obungu said. However, Kabianga, the runners up in the last two editions have vowed to spoil the party for Kisii. Obungu said: “Our handball and tennis teams are also very strong and we expect them to compete for top honours. We want to be a powerhouse in the region.” Over the weekend, Kisii clinched the national men's athletics title at the University of Eldoret and finished runners up table tennis and badminton. “Kisii will not enjoy the home support this time. We have a good team that is ready to wrestle the title from them,” said Kabianga's Abraham Ong'onga. At the same time, Ong'ong'a said KUSA has introduced frisbee as a competitive sport for the first time. In Western, Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST), Maseno, Kibabii, Rongo, Kabianga and hosts Kaimosi will battle it out. “This has been a recreation sport but we have decided to make it competitive,” said Ong'ong'a. The Western universities will also compete in women's soccer, men's handball and women's tennis. Ong'ong'a added that Tom Mboya University College is yet to confirm participation.
