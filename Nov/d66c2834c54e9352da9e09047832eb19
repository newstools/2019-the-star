On Monday last week, Chief Justice David Maraga alleged — in a nationwide televised address  — what he called a plot by two powerful Cabinet Secretaries, known to be close to President Uhuru Kenyatta —to remove him from office (the Star page 1: November 5. ‘How CSs are plotting to remove Maraga’). They and their minions are said to be angry that Maraga has refused to remove some judges perceived to be hostile to the state. We already know what our esteemed President has said about the Judiciary, that it is broken and needs to be fixed for annulling his first presidential election. The Judiciary’s budget has been slashed to the detriment of the people of Kenya.  Let’s assume the President was in the dark about budget cuts that hurt citizens, as well as the blatant insults to the Chief Justice, insults he himself would never be subjected to. So what has he said or done about this travesty of justice emanating from his own hallowed office? He has been disturbingly silent. Why? I wonder. An honourable and courageous president would immediately right this wrong, sack the blackguards and scoundrels (we know there are more than two), their bosses and publicly apologise to the CJ for the injustice done to Kenyans, and to him personally. Fortunately, the Judiciary’s punitive budget cuts were rescinded, thanks to the public uproar. The President needs to recall his civics lessons: separation of powers, three equal branches of government and independence of the judiciary. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is equal to the President who heads the Executive branch of government. Ponder that, Mr President. You’re a good Christian. Act accordingly. Aren’t you outraged too, even just a tiny bit?  Nairobi
