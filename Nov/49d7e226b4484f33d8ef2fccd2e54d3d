Diamond Platnumz's sister Esma Khan miscarried a few weeks ago. “Yes, I was pregnant. I miscarried, so I went to the hospital,” she told Wasafi. Esma and her baby daddy are back together after their public break-up that drove them into the arms of other partners. “He and I have been back together for a while but we were in relationships with other people. But our children have brought us back together,” she said. “We gave each other an ultimatum of two weeks to leave our other relationships.”
