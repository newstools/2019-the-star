President Uhuru Kenyatta has revealed how handouts were given during the Kibra by-election held on November 7. Speaking at the Bomas of Kenya during the BBI launch on Wednesday, Uhuru said he received reports from his campaigner that money had been 'poured' and was in circulation. "I called my campaigner in Kibra to ask her how things were in Kibra . Akasema tuko sawa akasema hapa Kibra ni kilio tu..nikamuuliza kuna shida gani.. akasema jamani mngeruhusu hii campaign iendelee tukule mambo huku," he said. (She said everything was alright but she wanted the campaigns to go on for another two weeks so that they could enjoy the handouts) Uhuru said the campaigner asked him if they could extend the campaigning period for two more weeks to allow them to 'enjoy' the good money that they were receiving. "Kwa nini mlifunga? Tungeendelea wiki ingine mbili..Kesho yake nikampigia simu akanijulisha hali ilivyo huko. Akasema sahi kuna harufu ya samaki kwa sababu mbeleni walikuwa na harufu ya nyama..." he said. (Why did you guys close the campaign period? The next day I called and asked how things were. She told me how the aroma of fish filled the area adding that they were used to meat aromas during the campaign season) The by-election followed the death of MP Ken Okoth after he succumbed to cancer in July. In Laini Saba, voters at the Mashimoni polling station claimed there were incidences of bribery with Sh200 notes being disbursed. ODM's Imran Okoth eventually won the election with Jubilee's McDonald Mariga coming in second.
