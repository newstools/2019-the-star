As curtains closed in on the very much anticipated Kibra by-election, one would be quick to surmise that it signified the end of at least a three-month political fiasco witnessed in Kibra. Contrary to this, the closure of the by-election opened a door to blame games. Over the past few days, MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto have been touting claims that ODM leader Raila Odinga orchestrated goons to disrupt the by-election. The famous Tangatanga faction allied to Ruto has been piling pressure on President Uhuru Kenyatta’s handshake buddy to make a public apology for allegedly being the mastermind in the post-election uproar. The Ruto fanatics went further to point accusing fingers at Interior CS Fred Matiang’i and PS Karanja Kibicho for failing to take action against people who allegedly prevented Jubilee supporters from voting. One would not be wrong to deduce that the by-election was more of a battle for the top politicians measuring their political strength ahead of 2022. Kibra was referred to as Raila’s bedroom, further making it seem like DP Ruto was intruding with his Jubilee’s flagbearer McDonald Mariga. Some Jubilee MPs even went on the ground to rally support for ODM’s Imran Okoth to succeed his late brother Ken. They said he knew Ken’s agenda for Kibra and would be in a better position to complete Ken’s legacy. As 2022 temperature continues to rise, it is evident that we are going to see more political changes and pacts formed. Politicians will continue to taint each other’s names and reputations all in the name of ‘looking good’ in the eyes of their supporters. But ODM’s Kibra win was a clear message to other parties that Kibra indeed is Baba’s ‘bedroom’ not to be intruded. Kitengela
