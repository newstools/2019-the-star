Former Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale has blamed ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi and Kakamega Senator Moses Wetangula for 'spoiling' Mariga's win in the Kibra by-election. He said the 5,275 votes cast to ANC's Eliud Owalo and the 260 votes to Ford Kenya's Khamisi Butichi could have boosted Mariga's tally. Results from the 183 polling stations showed Imran secured victory with 24, 636 votes with Mariga coming in second with 11, 230 votes. The total votes cast was 41, 984 against a registered number 118, 658 votes representing a 35.38% voter turnout. Khalwale also said Mariga's female supporters were scared off by ODM goons blocking them from voting. He congratulated Mariga saying he still considers him a winner. Boni Khawale was on Thursday morning kicked out of Kibra by residents upon arrival inÂ Laini Saba ward. In a video posted on Twitter, Khalwale was seen walking away from the rowdy residents as they hauled insults at him.
