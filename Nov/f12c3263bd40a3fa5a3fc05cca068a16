Fashion brand takes leather industry by storm With plans to revive the tannery and leather manufacturing plants in Kenya, Maridadi Point Fashion (MPF) has tapped into the market to provide quality products. The government is set to establish industrial parks in 35 constituencies in an effort to create jobs and boost manufacturing. Trade and Industrialization Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya said they will on November 29, launch the centres at Othaya, Nyeri County. Maridadi Point Fashion offers a wide range of full-grain leather products, including handbags, jackets, weekenders, briefcase bags, laptop bags, belts, men’s and women’s shoes, wallets among other ranges of products. MPF praised the government for its efforts to revive the industry, adding that it will help create employment, both directly and indirectly. Deputy Governor James Nyoro last week said the Kiambu county government is looking for land in Thika to set up a tannery and leather manufacturing plant. Nyoro said Kiambu is known for high-quality hides and skins. “Our priority is to revive the leather industry and we are sourcing for a 50-acre land in Thika where we will invest in tanneries and leather manufacturing plants to produce shoes, handbags, car seat cushions, jackets, leather garments, and even industrial gloves,” Nyoro said. He spoke at Thika Technical Training Institute after the closing ceremony of the Central Region SME Conference & Expo 2019.
