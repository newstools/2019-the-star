Naivasha police are holding a 17-year-old in connection with the stabbing death of a 16-year-old girl said to have rejected his sexual advances. She was stabbed more than 10 times and the corpse allegedly was kept under the youth's bed while he slept. The teen from a Nairobi school allegedly killed the girl after she reportedly spurned him at an estate off the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu Road. The girl went missing on Thursday afternoon. The body was found by neighbours on Friday morning.   The girl's father said they had left Naivasha for a burial ceremony when their daughter went missing. The family had left her in charge of their shop but they were unable to reach her by phone later in the day. The youth's mother said, â€œSince he went to Form 3 he has changed and has become rude but we never knew he would commit such a crime." A neighbour called the slain girl bright, humble and respectful and said the neighbourhood was in shock. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru confirmed the killing and said the suspect was in custody.
