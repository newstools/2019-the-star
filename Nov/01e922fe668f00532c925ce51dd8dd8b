The Kisumu government plans to undertake research, training and strategic resource mobilisation to improve food security. Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o yesterday said his administration is committed to supporting farmers to increase yields. He said Kisumu has huge potential, hence its vast arable land should be put under serious farming. “My government plans to introduce modern agronomic methods and resilient breeds to boost food security in line with my manifesto through research and innovations," Nyong'o said. He urged farmers to adopt commercial farming to boost their income. "Let's move away from the traditional farming method and diversify,"  he said. The county chief spoke during a visit to Ombeyi in Muhoroni. He said the subcounty has good climatic conditions for both sugarcane and dairy farming, which farmers should fully exploit. He pledged to support programmes that boost household incomes and food production, and improve livelihoods and change lives. “The plan will revamp economic activities in the area and guarantee the increased number of harvests to cushion us from hunger,” he said. He asked elected leaders to unite and shun divisive politics that stifles development. “We need to focus on bettering the living standards of our people and not cheap propaganda. Let us work hard to make our people self-reliant," Nyong'o said. The county plans to work with development partners in improving innovation and technology in agriculture. (Edited by F'Orieny)
