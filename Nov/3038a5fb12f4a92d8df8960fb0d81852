 Eight car theft syndicate suspects will remain in custody for 10 more days until the police complete their investigations. Kibera senior resident magistrate Boaz Ombewa on Wednesday allowed detectives to continue holding the suspects amid complaints that “the Flying Squad officers are beating us up in cells and exposing us to suffering". Mwenga Kariuki, Daniel Kabita, Paul Mwaura Karanja, Edward Musonye Ikatwa, Christine Mwongeli Munyao, Alex Kioko, Daniel Gisiri and Elphas Sula were arrested on Monday in Umoja and Soweto estates after the detectives analysed a CCTV footage of the theft of two vehicles. The prosecution wanted to have them detained for 15 days amid complaints that police were brutalising and harassing them in the cells. They alleged that the officers stole their money and mobile phones. The suspects said their families were not aware of their detention and requested the court to order the police to return their mobiles phones. On Tuesday morning, the DCI said in a statement that they had recovered two vehicles believed to have been stolen in Lang’ata. “The two, KCW 834A and   KCS 757V which had been stolen from Phenom Estate in Lang'ata were yesterday recovered by DCI following a rigorous operation at Umoja & Soweto areas," the statement said. The case will be mentioned early next month.
