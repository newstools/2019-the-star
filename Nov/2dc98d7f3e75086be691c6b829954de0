Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) Championship enters matchday four with log leaders Strathmore Leos and second-placed Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST) hoping to maintain their perfect start. Leos, who were relegated from Kenya Cup last season and MMUST who are promotion favourites, remain unbeaten. Leos lead the log with 14 points after three wins and two bonus points, closely followed by MMUST with 13 points. Tomorrow, Leos will be away against 11th placed Mombasa RFC at Mombasa Sports Club who are seen as a hostile hunting ground for upcountry teams while MMUST visit troubled and bottom of the table Kisii RFC at Gusii Stadium. Kisii, a former Kenya Cup side, dished out a walkover against United States International University's Martials and dropped to bottom place after being docked two points. Kisii coach Eric Bosire will seek to end MMUST's 100 per cent record and lift themselves from the bottom of the table. Yesterday, MMUST head coach Ochieng Ahaya said: “We have started well but what matters is the finishing. I don't want to speculate on the kind of game we expect against Kisii but we are going there for a win.” University of Eldoret's Trojans , under Kelvin Otieno, will host USIU looking to return to winning ways after losing 21-15 against Egerton Wasps in Njoro. USIU is yet to win a game this season having lost to debutants Eldoret RFC and MMUST. At St Joseph's Primary School in Ukunda, fourth-placed South Coast Pirates will host newbies Northern Suburbs, who are hoping for their second win of the season. Former Kenya Cup sides Catholic Monks and Mean Machine will clash at the Catholic University of East Africa in Langata. Both teams have won only one match so far. After recording their first win of the season, Egerton Wasps entertain newcomers Eldoret RFC at Njoro in Nakuru County.
