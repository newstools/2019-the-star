Gospel singer Daddy Owen's Malaika Tribute Awards has partnered with various celebrities to help 20 children who need corrective surgeries. This will be in line with the theme for this year's World Disability Day: 'The future is accessible'. The partnership is on a mission to raise about Sh6 million to help fund the surgeries. Among the celebrities set to take part are DJ Mo, Dr Ofweneke, Moji, Masterpiece, Ayrosh, Collo, Timeless Noel, Carol Radull, Maureen Waititu, Denno, Jabidii, DJ Euphoria and Didi. The culmination of the campaign will be the Ability Fest event at Uhuru Gardens.
