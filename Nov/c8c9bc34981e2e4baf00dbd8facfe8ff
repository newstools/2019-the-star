The Belgian King's Day was marked recently at the Belgian ambassadorial residence in Muthaiga, hosted by Belgian Ambassador Nicolas Nihon and his wife Poy Nihon. The chief guest was Foreign Affairs ministry director Patrick Ambani. Dignitaries, government officials and business people attended. Since 1866, the day has been marked by celebrations in honour of the Belgian monarch.
