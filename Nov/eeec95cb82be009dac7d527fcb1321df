He has been on this planet 45 short days but he has already attained what many go to great lengths to achieve—100,000 followers on social media. Admittedly Naseeb Jnr has managed this fete thanks to his famous parents, but that's beside the point. Tanasha Donna and Diamond Platnumz's son is the newest celebrity in town. The child was born on October 2. He has already garnered 100,000 followers on Instagram. "Welcome to the world NJ. Daddy loves you! Naseeb Junior," Tanzanian star Diamond posted on social media after the birth of his fourth child. Naseeb Jnr was named after his father, whose real name is Naseeb Abdul Juma. According to Diamond's mother, Mama Dangote, Tanasha named her son Naseeb because he was born on the same day as his father. On October 2, the Baba Lao hitmaker spent the night at Aga Khan Hospital, Dar es Salaam, where he celebrated his birthday by cutting a cake and sharing it with his family and nurses. On Tuesday the couple finally unveiled their son’s face during a celebration to mark his 40 days on earth. The party was held at the singer’s Madale house in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. In the Muslim culture, a new mother and her baby spend 40 days in confinement to allow the woman to rest. The mother does nothing else but care for her newborn; relatives and friends come to help her. The woman resumes her household duties and ventures outside the house on the 40th day, when the celebration is traditionally held. The event was attended by the who-is-who in the Tanzanian entertainment industry and was covered live on TV. Celebrities present included Rayvanny, Lava Lava, Mbosso, Mama Dangote, Queen Darleen, Esma Khan and Wolpe,r among others. Tanasha's family did not turn up for the celebration. Naseeb is Diamond's fourth child and Tanasha's firstborn. The singer has two children with former wife Zari Hassan—Princess Tiffah and Prince Nillan. He also has a child with Tanzanian model Hamisa Mobetto—Daylan Abdul Naseeb.
