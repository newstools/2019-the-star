Kirinyaga county will oppose the BBI report if it fails to recommend additional constituencies, Woman Representative Purity Ngirici has said. She said the county will vigorously reject the report when it’s brought for national consultation. Additional constituencies mean more power and Central Kenya says it has the numbers for more units. Ngirici said the county is waiting for the report with bated breath but promised to "to traverse the whole county if it fails to capture the wishes of the residents". Speaking at Mbiri Primary school, the MP said she will move around the county immediately the report is released by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday to educate them on its benefits. She was accompanied by her husband, Jubilee activist Andrew Peter Ngirici, at a fundraiser for boda boda operators and women's groups which raised Sh400,000. "If it doesn’t capture the inspirations of the residents, I will be at the forefront campaigning against it countrywide," Ngirici said. The MP said the report must be released soon to reduce anxiety among Kenyans. She said tea, coffee, rice and milk farmer are suffering due to a poor market and said BBI must address those issues. The report will be "thrown into the dustbin" if it proposes the creation of positions for a few leaders, she said, warning that they are ready to face off with those who want to create positions for their personal benefit. Peter backed her remarks saying the report will fail if the government entrusts Governor Anne Waiguru with the role of popularising it at the ground. The county boss is very unpopular and will make the residents revolt against the report if she’s given a role in campaigning for the report, he said. He also accused Kirinyaga professionals of hijacking the process "yet they are aloof and don't know the problems facing local residents". Edited by R.Wamochie
