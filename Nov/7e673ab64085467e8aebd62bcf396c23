Kapaseret MP Oscar Sudi has called ODM leader Raila Odinga a "devil worshiper" after jubilee lost the Kibra by-election. “Prior to the Kibra poll, Raila had flown to Nigeria, a lot of witchcraft dominates his head,” Sudi told a St Patrick’s Catholic Church fundraiser in Eldam-Ravine, Baringo county, on Sunday. Raila applied "crooked ways" to make sure the Kalenjin, Kikuyu, Kamba and Luhya did not vote for their favourite candidates he said. “This old man is a real devil and he must be defeated in Jesus name…how [many] people are supporting me, can you raise up your hand with me?” Sudi asked. The MP called Raila a "black colonialist", blaming him for the slow development in Kibra slums. "Imagine serving as Langata MP for over 20 years and prime minister for five years and to date, the people of Kibra still pack and dispose of human waste using polythene bags,” he said. “As young leaders of this country, we must fight tooth and nail until this old Devil-Raila retires,” Sudi said. “We want to ensure every Kenyan tribe can live and work in every corner of this country without any fear of being threatened,” he said. Sudi urged Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula to ditch Raila’s "witchcraft’ camp" and join Deputy President William Ruto to form the next government in 2022. “Raila doesn’t go to church, he doesn't fundraise in churches or mosques ...how then can he get get God's blessings?" Sudi asked. (Edited by V. Graham)
