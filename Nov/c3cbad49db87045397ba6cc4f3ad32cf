You can now experience the National Museums of Kenya from the comfort of your home via your phone. Under the Google Arts and Culture project titled: “Utamaduni Wetu: Meet the People of Kenya”, art enthusiasts can check out cultural collections under the National Museums of Kenya that tell the stories of 28 communities. Dr Mzalendo Kibunjia, the National Museums of Kenya director-general, said, “With digital technologies, there has scarcely been a more efficient way for cultural institutions to produce and preserve cultural goods and for consumers.” During the event, Google also celebrated a number of Kenya’s YouTube content creators who have made strides in subscriptions. The Churchill Show with over 1 million subscribers was awarded the Gold Creator Award. They are the second YouTube channel in Kenya to receive the gold play button after Citizen TV.
