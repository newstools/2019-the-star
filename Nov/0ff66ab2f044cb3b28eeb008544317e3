 Taita Taveta MCAs have passed a motion that requires the county gvernment to register all residents living with disabilities. The motion moved by Health and Sanitation Committee chairman Frank Mmare on Wednesday is intended to determine the exact number of PWDs so as to facilitate effective services. "It is a shame that this county lacks data which is crucial for planning for this marginalised group hence the country cannot even afford to carter for their needs and offer vital services,” Mmare said. He said people with disabilities require special attention, especially with regards to jobs and tenders. Majority leader Jason Tuja said those with disabilities were faced with stigma and discrimination. “Most people look down upon them and neglect them. Disabled people may find it hard to socialise with other members of society. This can lead to depression as well as self-pity, if not checked,” the Weruga MCA said. He called for a hastened registration process alongside civic education to sensitise those with disabilities on tax exemption. “Most Kenyans with disability are still unaware of their tax exemption status thus losing out on income they can save,” Tuja said. According to Fatuma Kadzo, the county representative for the National Council for Persons With Disabilities, PWDs living in the county have been neglected. "We feel left out in all departments because only a few job opportunities are given to our members," Kadzo said. She asked the government to ensure at least 30 per cent of tenders are reserved for youth, women and PWDs.  edited by peter obuya
