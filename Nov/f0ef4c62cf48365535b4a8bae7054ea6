Tanzanian star Ali Kiba seems to have dedicated his new song, 'Mshumaa', to his Kenyan wife Amina Khalef. This is after he revealed that he returned Amina back to Kenya, confirming that indeed, they had marital issues but they are still husband and wife. In the song, Kiba sings, "I miss you, we will see each other. Even when God plans that I die tomorrow, I believe, we will see each other." Adding, "Let me remind you, when I put a ring you, you said you'll never leave me until I die. Your presence was my being."
