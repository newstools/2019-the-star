Kenya will host the Afrobasket pre-qualifiers in January next year, Basketball Federation chairman Paul Otula revealed yesterday. He said the tournament that will bring together regional teams will be held at Nyayo National Stadium gymnasium on January 14-18. "We have been given the chance to host this event because of our national men's team success in the Afrochan event in Mali," noted Otula. Teams that will battle it out in the Nairobi spectacle alongside Kenya are South Sudan, Somalia, Burundi, Ethiopia and Tanzania. Otula said that this is a huge honour bestowed on the country by continental body Fiba and urged everybody to support it if Kenya was to realise another success. "The last time we hosted a championship of this magnitude was in 1993 at Kasarani. Getting another chance means we are back on track." said the KBF supremo. He said that they will retain the same side that did duty in Bamako opting only to replace assistant coach Carey Oketch with high flying Thunder tactician Collins Gaya. "Carey got a coaching job in Rwanda where he is currently based. We have named Gaya to take over his role," remarked Otula. He said the national side will be assembled on December 15 where they still start strict camping. " We are fortunate that all the players who did duty for the country are engaged. They are not far from their best," he noted. Three foreign-based players made the provisional team. Thunder's Griffin Ligare has been maintained as the captain. Squad: Faheem Jima (Thunder), Bush Wamukota (Tunisia), Valentine Nyakinda, Ariel Okal (KPA), Victor Bosire, Eric Mutoro, Tiberius Menya (Ulinzi), Fidel Okoth (Strathmore University), Tylor Ongwae (Bakien Bears- Denmark).  Others are, Victor Ochieng (Equity Bank),  Ronnie Gundo (Strathmore University), Robert Nyakundi (France), Brian Namake ( Uganda), Desmond Owili (Australia).
