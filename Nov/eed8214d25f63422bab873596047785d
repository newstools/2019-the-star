 Mandera will sponsor the secondary education of its top ten students who scored the highest marks in this year's KCSE exam. Governor Ali Roba on Sunday said the county government will for the second year sponsor the education of the students in schools they will be selected to join. Roba said his administration was committed to investing in education which he said was the only means to turn around the livings standards of the region. The county's top performers include Asiya Ali Adan who scored 409 marks from Buraq Academy, Khalid Kheir Yussuf of Lafey Primary (407),  Abdirizack Siyad Adan (Lafey Primary, 404), Shukri Abdi Nurow (Gither Primary, 403), Burhan Maalim Khalif (Lafey Primary, 400)  and Muad Adan Abdulla of Wargadud Primary who also scored 400 marks. Others include Mohamed Abdullahi (Banisa Primary, 398), Abdiwahab Derow (Lafey Primary, 393), Salma Osman (Al-Huda Primary, 392) and Muhidhin Ahmed (390) and Deni Kashif Mohamed (390) both of Lafey Primary. “We have just received the analysis of the KCPE performance in Mandera and we are delighted to share the joy we feel with the residents. Despite the myriad of challenges we face as a county, our pupils have managed to make us proud,” Roba said. The top county student was a girl for the third consecutive year. Roba said they were very proud of the performance of girls. He said his administration will reward hard work and good performance. “We are very proud of the current trend of girls leading the boys. This shows that our daughters if given the opportunity and the necessary support, can perform marvelously well." Roba said the county will monitor the progress of the students throughout the four years in secondary school. Last month, Roba traveled to Turkey to oversee the admission of the county's top girls in last year's KCSE exam to Üsküdar University in Istanbul.  edited by peter obuya
