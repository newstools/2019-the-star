Second-placed Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST) and third-placed Mean Machine battle it out as the hunt for KRU Championship points enters matchday six. MMUST remain unbeaten so far and coach Ochieng Ahaya is confident his charges will overcome the three-time Kenya Cup champions, who were relegated last season.  Machine started the season with two losses but recovered to win three on the trot. Ahaya’s troops sit second on the log with 21 points, three behind log leaders Strathmore Leos who face fifth-placed United States International University’s Martials. In last weekend's outing, Leos overwhelmed South Coast Pirates 57-0. Pirates will be at home against Egerton University’s Wasps at St Joseph’s Ukunda. Pirates coach Howard Okwemba said Leos gave his boys a reality check. “Leos’ experience overwhelmed us. It was a learning curve for the boys and we are looking to bounce back against visiting Egerton Wasps. We expect a very fast game but we are ready for it,” said Okwemba. Egerton’s Enos Otieno said: “ Our season is back on track but our biggest problem is injuries, which have depleted the squad. We are going for maximum points against Pirates. We have remained disciplined in our last three matches and took our chances as well.” Simon Jawichire’s Northern Suburbs host fellow debutants Eldoret RFC at the Catholic University of East Africa. Catholic Monks entertain struggling Kisii RFC at the same venue, seeking to bounce back after losing to Suburbs last weekend. At the Mombasa Sports Club, former Kenya Cup side Mombasa RFC welcome University of Eldoret’s Trojans, who are winless in their last three encouters.
