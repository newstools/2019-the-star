University of Eldoret track and field captain Paul Korir is positive his team will reclaim the athletics title at this year's Kenya Universities Sports Association Open at Moi University West Campus today. After dominating the discipline for years, UoE finished third last year behind overall winners Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology and Jaramogo Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology respectively. Despite falling short in 2018, Korir who is injured and will not compete has assured that they will launch a good fight to bring back their glory. “We have a good team and we expect to deliver quality results over the weekend. Though I am injured, I believe my teammates will fly the flag high,” said Korir. Track and field will be staged at Moi University, a facility which is usually used by top athletes as their training base. In basketball, Moi University- Annex campus women's side and Maseno University men's team will be defending their titles. Other sports featuring in today's showpiece include badminton, chess, scrabble and table tennis for both men and women. KUSA Secretary-General Joseph Sandagi said the teams are prepared for the event before next month’s national championships at the same venue.
