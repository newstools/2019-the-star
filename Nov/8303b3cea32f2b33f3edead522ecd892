Harambee Starlets' opponents for tomorrow's Olympics qualifier Zambia arrived yesterday morning from Lusaka. The 'Shepolopolo' as the Zambian women's national team is referred to, will have a feel of the stadium this afternoon (4 pm), according to an itinerary released by Football Kenya Federation (FKF) International match organising Committee. The tie will be crucial in determining who gains an advantage ahead of the second leg scheduled for Monday in Lusaka. In the meantime, Starlets have been in camp since Thursday last week and will be looking forward to a positive result tomorrow. David Ouma's charges played only one friendly, losing 3-1  to the national under 15 side,  in preparation for tomorrow's crucial home leg. Stars will finalise their training at Moi Stadium, Kasarani this morning in anticipation of a tough duel against the Zambians. The winner of the tie on aggregate will go through to the final qualifying round, where either Ivory Coast or Cameroon lie in wait. The final winner will gain automatic qualification to the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, while the loser on aggregate will get a lifeline in a playoff against Chile, who came second in the South American Confederation’s (CONMEBOL) qualifying tournament.
