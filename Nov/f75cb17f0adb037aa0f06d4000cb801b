Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji has reached out to Qatar for partnerships in the fight against corruption. On Wednesday, Haji signed an MoU with Qatar Attorney General Ali Bin Fetails al-Marri to enhance cooperation and collaboration. “Qatar, in partnership with the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (Unitar) hosts one of the best anti-corruption training institutes in the world– the Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption Center (ROLACC),” Haji said during a joint press briefing at his Upperhill office in Nairobi. The Public Prosecutions office in Qatar has been recognised and awarded for developing the world’s best document-tracking system which leads in terms of output and volume. The agreement was signed to strengthen the joint fight against cross-border organised crime and corruption. “Kenya stands to benefit from the possibility of evidence and information sharing as it will enhance its operational capacity,” the DPP said. The agreement, among other things, cites cooperation in activities including mentorship, exchange programmes, special projects and technical assistance to facilitate capacity building and training. Kenya also stands to benefit from best practices on policies and procedures and exchange of experts, information and technology, he said. The signing of the document was witnessed by Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti and Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission CEO Twalib Mbarak. The move comes at a time when Kenya is grappling with economic disruption over increased graft in state organisations. In Haji’s tenure, the country has witnessed arrests of senior government officials suspected to be involved in high-level corruption deals. Prosecution of high-level graft suspects has elicited optimism among Kenyans and the international community. In June, Haji and Kinoti were in Washington DC seeking more partnerships from the Federal Bureau of Investigations. Edited by R.Wamochie
