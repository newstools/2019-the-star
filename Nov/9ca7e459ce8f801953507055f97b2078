Residents in Kwale county have been advised to renovate toilets to curb an outbreak of diseases after heavy rains destroyed the facilities. Speaking in Matuga subcounty, Lukore area chief Justus Mulinge said an assessment by village elders reveals that a large majority of latrines in rural areas are dilapidated. "As we speak, many toilets are down while some are almost collapsing and this is what your local heads have reported,” Mulinge said. He said the rains are likely to persist for an unknown length of time, triggering health problems if toilets are unrepaired. Mulinge told the residents to not only construct toilets but also using them correctly for their own health. “Don’t build toilets because it is a norm, make good use of them and observe proper hygiene to save you from many dangers,” Mulinge said. Lukore chief’s statements comes a week after World Toilet Day. He said the county discourages open defaecation, which harms human beings, animals, soil, plants and water. Mulinge said most people in rural areas prioritise building houses and later toilets after a long period of using the bushes. He commended Lukore location for being voted number one as an open defaecation-free zone. He said his area had been leading in unhygienic condition but has gradually become a better place in terms of sanitation. “I am proud of Lukore local residents for their efforts to becoming civilised citizens for over a short time. Now they observe good hygiene," the chief said. Chief Mulinge asked residents in other suburbs of Kinango, Lunga-Lunga and Msambweni to emulate Lukore location and practice good hygiene and sanitation.  (Edited by V. Graham)
