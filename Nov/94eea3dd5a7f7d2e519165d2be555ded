 The national government has been urged to support the Nairobi Integrated Urban Development Master Plan and the Central Railway proposal. The call came from former Town Clerk Phillip Kisia who said that if effected, the plan will address transport, solid waste management, urban renewal, water and sewerage among other issues. Kisia said the project will set up new homes and shopping centres to create both business and employment opportunities. “It will create a ‘Sandton city’ in Eastlands of Nairobi just like Johannesburg has done. It will be the first and only city of its kind in East and Central Africa,” Kisia said by phone. (Sandton is an affluent area situated in Johannesburg Municipality.) The master plan and the Redevelopment of the Nairobi Central Railway station are 2010-2013 collaborations of City Hall and Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica). Kisia said the plan will also ensure optimal economic utilisation of the idle Railway land as part of the revitalisation and expansion of the Central Business District. It will redefine the CBD boundaries and sort out public transport chaos. “The components included are loop lines, light rail, improvement and expansion of the old railways and BRT,” Kisia said. He said the plan is anchored on the Nairobi Master Plan and in line with the Big 4 agenda. “This plan aims at radically changing Nairobi City by transforming it into a modern metropolis with a polycentric structure as opposed to the spatial inefficiency of the monocentric structure,” he said.
