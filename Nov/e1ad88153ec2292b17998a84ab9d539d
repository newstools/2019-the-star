A Moi University student has been charged with mistreating her day-old child and abandoning it in the cold. Mercy Chepwogen allegedly put the baby boy in a shopping bag and left him in the cold on the night of November 1 in Umoja estate. Yesterday, she denied the charge before a Makadara chief magistrate Emily Ominde. The child was rescued by a couple who heard him crying loudly outside. On checking, they saw a bag on a rooftop of a house. The crying infant was in the bag and naked. The couple covered the baby with a shawl and reported the matter to the police and thereafter took the baby to Mama Lucy Hospital. Police investigations led to the arrest of Chepwogen who, however, denied having given birth to the baby. But a medical examination showed she had recently given birth. The case will be mentioned on November 11.
