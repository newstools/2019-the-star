Ford Kenya aspirant in the ongoing Kibra by-election Khamisi Butichi has cast his vote at the DC grounds. Butichi has asked Kibra to turn up and decide their next Member of Parliament. Addressing the press after casting his vote, Butichi said the low turn out might have been contributed by the high number of Kibra people who decided to go to work first. "We have a low turn out today. I'm calling upon locals to turn up and participate in this by-election," Butichi said. Butichi has hailed the commission for their preparation and has asked the security officers to arrest individuals who have been alleged to be bribing voters. IEBC said the doors were opened by 6 am and will be closed at 5pm for the counting process. The commission said KIEMS kits will be used to bio-metricallyÂ identify voters, asking all registered voters in Kibra Constituency to turn out and exercise their democratic rights. The Constituency is seeking their next MP who will take over from the late Ken Okoth. IEBC cleared 24 aspirants for the by-election.
