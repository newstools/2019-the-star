A Kiambu court has extended a warrant of arrest against a doctor accused of killing an unborn child. Senior principal magistrate Stella Atambo extended the arrest order against Samuel Ndirangu Kibira following an application by the state that he has not yet been arrested since he went under ground last December. The prosecutor told the court that police have been hunting for him to bring him before court to plead to the charges of abortion but Ndirangu had frustrated the process causing the delay of the case. Ndirangu is jointly charged alongside Paul Simiyu Wandagwa who is a relative of a 13-year-old girl name the two allegedly helped to procure an abortion. The prosecution alleges that on December 7, 2018 at Bethsaida Catholic Dispensary in Toritu area, Kiambu county, Ndirangu and Simiyu prevented the child from being born alive. Simiyu alone is charged with defiling the girl on several occasions at Mwandus area in Kiambu township and making her pregnant. Simiyu is still in remand prison after failing to raise bond of Sh300,000.
