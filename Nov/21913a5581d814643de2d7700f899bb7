Fresh from winning Standard Chartered 10km Road race, Nancy Jelagat has landed an invite to feature in Sunday’s Boulogne Half marathon in France. The Iten-based runner, who has dominated most local road races including 2019 Family bank Half Marathon in October, said she is ready for her second international outing. “I have prepared well and I hope to seal my first win outside Kenya,” he said. Jelagat said she will be chasing her personal best time as well as the title following her last year's international debut in Hamburg Half Marathon, where she placed second in 70:18. “I will be chasing two birds with one stone. I am chasing the title as well as my personal best in France. I have had good training and I hope I will live up to expectations,” said Jelagat, who trains under Erick Kogo. She said considering her current top form ahead, she will approach the race at a high pace. " I suffered last year because of a slower pace and I want to avoid that," he said. “I have totally improved in my running tactics and speed as compared to last year. With this development, I know I will register good results,” she noted. Meanwhile, Jelagat will not be defending her 21km Chebara Dam set for this weekend in Elgeyo Marakwet County. She won last year’s title but this time she has opted top compete internationally because the dates for the two races are clashing.
