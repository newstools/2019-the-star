Hollywood megastar Forest Whitaker, who plays the baddest crime lord on TV,Â  Bumpy Johnson, would love to visit Kenya and enjoy its wild features and other tourist attractions. In a phone interview with Word Is on Thursday evening, Whitaker said he has been to visit Kenya previously but has no immediate plans to visit anytime soon. At the moment, he is in South Africa for a media tour of his show that is airing on Showmax, titled, 'Godfather of Harlem'. Whitaker said there was no time within this trip to Africa to fit a visit to Kenya. However, he will most definitely plan a trip to Kenya "in the near future". Speaking about playing the complex role of Bumpy Johnson, Whitaker said, "There were different things that were going through my mind. I was first trying to figure out who he was and where he was coming from. Some of the research that was done for the script helped me figure out what was happening in his life." Adding, "Then I did a lot of research with people. People who would help me understand what he was like. They helped me a lot to understand what he was thinking and the books that I got from his wife were helpful. It all came together to form a full character after I looked at some of his photographs." If he were to sit down with Bumpy Johnson, he said, "I think I would probably ask him how does he reconcile his work, where he was supplying the community with drugs and things of that nature, what does he think about how that would help the community?" Whitaker is known for playing captivating characters in other top productions like Black Panther and the Last King Of Scotland.
