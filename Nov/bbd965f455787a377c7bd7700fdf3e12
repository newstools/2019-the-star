A category for people living with disabilities will be added to the  2019 Rapid Chess National Championships slated for this weekend at Strathmore University. The championship, which is confined to Kenyan citizens only, has been divided into two other categories - Open and Ladies. The event will be played in an eight-round Swiss format of 15  minutes with a 10-second incremental per player. Chess Kenya (CK) secretary-general, John Mukabi alluded that people living with disabilities were not included in the past, hence the decision to add the category. "We have decided to add the category for people living with disability in all events organised by CK because we think it was a serious oversight," he said. The championship will have age categories from U8, U10, U12, U14, U16 and U18. Mukabi remarked that they are expecting about 400 players in this second edition of the championship. The deadline for the ongoing registration is Thursday this week. The winner in the open category will bag Sh20,000 while Sh15,000 will be up for grabs in the ladies category. In the people living with disability category, the winner will take home Sh10,000. The top three players in each category will receive trophy and medals, together with a certificate of participation. Candidate Master Benjamin Magana and Methu Joseph of KCB will defend their titles in the Rapids and Blitz categories respectively.
