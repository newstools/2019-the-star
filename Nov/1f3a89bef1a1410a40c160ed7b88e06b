Kenya Cup champions make the short trip to Nakuru to face Menengai Oilers in a tricky showdown today. The bankers have won their three opening matches, garnering bonus points while the hosts saw their perfect start to the season come to a halt, losing 25-20 to Homeboyz at Jamhuri Park last weekend. The two teams clashed in the Impala Floodlit final last month with the bankers winning 23-13. Assistant coach Dennis Mwanja described the match as the toughest they have played this far. “They are one of the teams that will be contending for the league title. They are well-coached and very resilient and we expect a competitive fixture against them,” added Mwanja. The bankers are joint top with Kabras on 15 points though the sugar millers have a superior points difference. The bankers have made two changes, recalling Kenya Sevens stars Andrew Amonde and Jacob Ojee for today's clash. Amonde replaces Felix Ojoo as Michael Wanjala is promoted from the bench to start ahead of Samuel Asati. Ojee takes over from Geoffrey Okwatch who moves to the open wing while Isaac Njoroge moves from the wing to fullback to replace Levy Amunga. Johnstone  Olindi and Vincent Onyala are on the bench. The forwards remain unchanged with skipper Curtis Lilako, Martin Olwila, Nick Ongeri and Rocky Aguko leading the onslaught. Lock Clinton Odhiambo will spearhead Oilers charge in the match. Theophilus Lusangalu starts at fly-half, Nick Mogire and Derrick Mbaire on the wings while Davis Nyaundi is at fullback. Gibson Weru's charges are placed fourth on the log with 11 points and they are relishing the challenge. In other fixtures, Kabras travel to Jamhuri Park to face Nondies in a doubleheader that will feature Homeboyz hosting Western Bulls. Impala have a date with Mwamba at the Impala Club while Nakuru host Quins in a bottom of the table clash. Blak Blad welcome Ksumu RFC to Kenyatta University.
