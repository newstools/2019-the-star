The Meru county assembly plans to build a Sh300 million office block. Speaker Joseph Kaberia on Wednesday said a huge number of MCAs and staff have no offices, hence the need for the 10-floor building, which is to be done in phases. Currently, only Majority leader Victor Karithi, Minority leader Ayub Bundi and chief whips Kithinji Ethaiba and Jediel Mauta have offices, leaving 64 MCAs without offices. Kaberia said the construction will start early next year and it will take two to three years, depending on the availability of funds. “The 10-floor office block will house the speaker’s office, staff and MCAs offices. It will have underground parking. There will be a Cafeteria and two friendly lifts,” the assembly boss said. He said hiring offices for MCAs and other staff is costly. “It will cost between Sh300million and Sh350million. We expect it to be financed in phases of three years. It will be within the assembly compound. Our design was done at no costs,” Kaberia said. He said they have acted in line with the Commission on Revenue Allocations recommendations and a parcel is available for the project. Meanwhile, Kaberia said they are in the process of buying a one-acre parcel for the construction of speaker’s official house, another acre for a deputy governor’s house and two acres for a governor’s house. He said the houses must be within the radius of 10 kilometres from Meru town. “The designs are done by the CRA. The chief government valuer must go on the ground and it’s a lengthy process. The National Land Commission told us they have no land to offer,” Kaberia said. (Edited by F'Orieny)
