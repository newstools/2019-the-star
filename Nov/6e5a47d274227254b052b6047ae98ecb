After an impressive start to the 2019/20 Kenya Rugby Championship season, Strathmore Leos captain Gabriel Adero can dare dream of a quick return to the top flight. Leos, alongside Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST) remain the only unbeaten teams five matches into the season and this has given Adero motivation of a return to Kenya Cup. The students thumped South Coast Pirates 57-0 while MMUST overcame University of Eldoret’s Trojans 22-3 in Kakamega. It was a rude welcome for newly appointed Pirates coach Howard Okwemba. Leos captain Gabriel Adero said: “So far so good. Our objective is a quick return to Kenya Cup and I’m confident we shall make it. We have played against our main opponents so far, we are only remaining with the United States International University.” “It was a difficult game and the scores don’t reflect the same. Our defence was resolute throughout the game,” said after their weekend encounter. Mean Machine beat Mombasa RFC 40-9 while newcomers Northern Suburbs upset Catholic Monks 25-13 in a game that was dubbed coach Simon 'Jawichire derby'. Jawichire is the director of sports at the Catholic University of East Africa and  Suburbs' coach. “It was a tough duel and both teams had a good performance but it was Suburbs’ day. Discipline issues cost Monks the game but they should be challenging for promotion as Suburbs seek a playoff position,” said Jawichire. USIU battled to a 14-14 draw against Egerton Wasps while newbies Eldoret RFC compounded former Kenya Cup side Kisii RFC’s woes beating the bottom-placed side 26-5 at the University of Eldoret. In the Nationwide Western region, Citam Kisumu recorded a hard-fought 10-7 win over MMUST’s development side while Mbale defeated Bungoma 10-0. Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology also had a 10-0 win over Siaya RFC. The game between Sheywe and Maseno was postponed to next year while Webuye got a 24-0 walkover after Vihiga failed to show up for their game.
