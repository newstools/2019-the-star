In all the polling stations visited by ELOG, gender parity was observed with both women and men working as polling officials.       However, ELOG noted the failure of the KIEMS in Jamhuri Primary School, Olympic Primary School and Upper Hill Secondary but IEBC was able to resolve these and identification and voting processes proceeded without any delays.         Act of violence were observed in DC grounds as a result of confrontation between rival supporters.  CONCLUSION ELOG notes that E-Day processes went well and were generally consistent with the laid down legal provisions as well global best practices.  ELOG urges IEBC, political parties as well as other stakeholders to address electoral malpractices such as violence, intimidation, voter bribery and violation of the secrecy of the vote. These incidences remain the major obstacle towards securing credible electoral processes in the country.
