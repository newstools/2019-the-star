West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo on Sunday said the death toll from the landslide had risen to 43. Sixteen patients were receiving treatment at Kapenguria county hospital following the Saturday landslide. County Health executive Geofrey Lipale said the county morgue could not handle the bodies and said the county had asked Kitale County Referral Hospital to receive some bodies. “Our morgue has no capacity to handle all the bodies and we have talked to our counterparts to help us in storing the bodies,” he said. So far, nine bodies had been taken to the mortuary out of 15 retrieved on Saturday. Speaking to press at the county hospital, Dr Moses Deng said most patients sustained minor injuries and only one had a fracture. “Most of the patients are in stable condition and one of the patients had a  fractured leg. Most of the patients had soft tissue injuries,” he said. Deng said two patients were discharged on Saturday evening after they were treated. Relatives of the deceased went to the Kapenguria mortuary on Sunday. William Lokapel said he lost three children. “Their mother and one child managed to escape death but we were unable to rescue the three children,” he said. Marko Yeko, a Standard Seven pupil at Karelechon Primary School, is nursing head injuries. “I have nothing to say but to thank God. I know very soon I will be leaving this hospital and go back to my family,” he said. Health chief officer Milka Psiwa said a counselling centre had been set up.
