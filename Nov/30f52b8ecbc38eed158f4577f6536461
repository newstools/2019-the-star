Three KCSE candidates in Kisii county will be writing their tests in hospital. County director Pius Ng’oma on Monday said one candidate delivered at the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital, while two felt sick. "We have three candidates who will be sitting their examinations in various hospitals. One of the candidates delivered while two others fell sick," Ng’oma said. He briefed the media at the county headquarters after Nelea Olick, a director of education from the ministry headquarters, dispatched the papers to exam centres. One student was admitted to Christamariane Hospital and another to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. "The candidate who was admitted to MTRH was involved in a road accident. We will be finding out how is he is doing, whether his condition will allow him to write the tests," Ng'oma said. He did not disclose the names of the candidates but the press obtained information that two of the students were from St Vincent Nyanko and Nyosia Mixed Secondary schools. Ng’oma was accompanied by acting county commissioner Leonard Mgute and police commander Martin Kibet. He said 28,708 candidates are sitting the examination in 372 centres across the county. “The container was opened on time and the examination dispatched to all the centres. Security has been beefed up. We want to ensure the integrity of the examination is protected,” he said. Officers will be visiting the centres to monitor the exam. This is part of efforts to curb cheating. Last year, 26,654 candidates sat the examination.
