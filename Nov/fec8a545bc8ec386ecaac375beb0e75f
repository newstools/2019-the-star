Livestock traders in Bungoma have expressed fears of heavy losses due to an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the county. The county's department of veterinary services last week directed for a quarantine of affected animals across the county's auction rings. Already Kamukuywa, Chwele and Misikhu market auction rings have been closed indefinitely. The disease is said to have spread from the neighbouring Kakamega county where a quarantine directive has also been declared. The traders from Webuye auction ring who spoke to the Star said that they fear that the quarantine might affect their business this coming festive season. Erick Simiyu, a trader in cows, goats and sheep said that he usually makes a lot of profits in December. But he fears negligible earnings this coming festive season. “We are worried that if this quarantine may continue till next year, then we might not have school fees for our children,” he said. The contagious disease leaves wounds in the mouth and hooves of animals. Markets hasten the spread of foot and mouth when diseased animals come into contact with healthy ones. Alex Waswa who sells goats at the market said that most of the butchers are worried that they might be forced to close their butcheries. Bungoma Livestock chief officer Isaack Arbut said that the county has rolled out a programme to vaccinate animals across the county to prevent the spread of diseases. He said that farmers have also been asked not to transport their animals out of the county.
