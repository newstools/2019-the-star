The Betting Control and Licensing Board has cautioned landlords against leasing their premises for gambling business. Chairman Cyrus Maina warned those whose houses are found hosting such trade will be arrested and arraigned. “Landlords have been hiding, with claims that they have given their clients their houses to do business without knowing the kind of trade. It is their responsibility to ensure that no betting is done in their premises,” Maina said. He addressed the press during the destruction of slot machines at Embakasi deputy county commissioner’s office on Tuesday. Over 500 machines were burnt down during the exercise supervised by area deputy county commissioner Kenneth Murunge. “We will ensure that all landlords where the illicit trade is conducted are arrested and arraigned,” Maina said. He said such betting joints harbour criminals who engage in illicit brew trade, bhang and other outlawed activities. “Betting is a time-wasting business. People have suffered. It’s addictive; it is not easy to get out of it.” He said that the destruction of machines was a sign of the government’s commitment to the fight against betting. Murunge said the machines were confiscated from various joints within Nairobi, Machakos and Kajiado counties. “Assistant chiefs, chiefs, deputy county commissioners and the police are all involved in the crackdown. We are working as a team. In Embakasi, we have lots of gambling machines,” Murunge said. He said most joints were always closed while gambling went on inside.
