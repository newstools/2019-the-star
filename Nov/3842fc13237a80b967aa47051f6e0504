Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital has upgraded its health services to include specialised surgeries, kidney transplants and open-heart surgeries. Last week, the Eldoret-based hospital carried out 20 plastic surgeries on burns' victims, according to chief executive officer Wilson Aruasa. One kidney transplant would be performed weekly. The hospital has also upgraded and expanded its High Dependency and ICU units to be able to handle emergency cases. The number of ICU units has increased from six to 20. The upgrade is in line with the government's Universal Health Care programme, Dr Aruasa said on Friday. He said they were intensifying outreach services in counties during which their health personnel will be trained to enable Kenyans to access specialised health services. The CEO said the upgrade would translate into fewer Kenyans seeking treatment outside the country. “We are fully committed to supporting President Kenyatta’s Big Four Agenda especially on healthcare by closely collaborating with the Ministry of Health and other stakeholders.” The hospital treats more than 1,200 patients in the outpatient and emergency units daily. On average, it admits 1,300 patients every day. Dr Aruasa said consultations with regional counties were ongoing with the intention to reduce the number of cases referred to the hospital. MTRH has an outreach of  22 counties. It also receives patients from neighbouring countries. The hospital is involved in an extensive campaign to ensure that many Kenyans enrol with the National Hospital Insurance Fund. The health facility is owed more than Sh500 million by patients who cannot afford to pay for treatment.  It occasionally waives charges for poor patients. MTHR is the second largest referral hospital in the country after Kenyatta National Hospital.
