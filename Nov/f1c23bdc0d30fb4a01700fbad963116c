More than 40 elected women MPs under the Inua Mama movement are set to tour Bungoma county on Friday. The group that comprises woman representatives, senators and MPs will champion grassroots development at Panpaper grounds in Webuye town. Inua Mamma movement is led by Kandara MP Alice Wahome. Bungoma woman representative Catherine Wambilianga has welcomed all elected leaders including Governor Wycliffe Wangamati, Senator Moses Wetang’ula and ward reps to the event. “All arrangements are complete and everything is set for the big day. I urge area residents to turn up in large numbers and welcome our leaders,” she said. Speaking to the star on Thursday, the legislator said that Inua Mama movement advocates for the financial empowerment of women, youths and people living with disabilities. The woman rep said she would not support the Building Bridges Initiative report because it will erode gains in the Constitution. “If the leaked BBI report is true then I can’t support it. There is no way CDF would be removed from constituencies to wards.  It also proposes that MCAs should be degree holders for them to be elected, this is wrong,” she said. Since her election, Wambilianga has supported various groups of women, youths and disabled persons by giving them grants to start businesses across the county.
