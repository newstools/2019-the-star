Drugs trafficking and illegal fishing in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden can be a ticking time bomb. That's what Defence CS  Raychelle Omamo said on Wednesday, calling for increased focus on drug trafficking and illegal fishing. She said they are not getting as much attention as piracy did "and this could be a ticking time bomb". Speaking during a regional meeting on maritime security in the two areas, the CS said the war against piracy was won because there was a convergence of interests. “Everybody was interested in getting rid of that threat,” she said at PrideInn Paradise in DShanzu, Mombasa. Kenya Maritime Authority director general George Okong’o said there have been no piracy attacks since 2012, "which shows there is strength in collaboration". “However, this does not mean there are no more threats.” Omamo said the same convergence of interests should be replicated in fighting illegal and unregulated fishing and drug trafficking. The CS said defeating piracy looked impossible challenge but was surmounted due to joint efforts. She said modern pirates were desperate young Africans on skiffs who managed to change the world. This shows that young Africans are capable of doing extraordinary things but only need guidance to do positive things that will transform the continent, Omamo said. “We do that when we create zones of peace and prosperity, ensure that their governments are capable and when we create space for them to realise their fullest potential." Shipping and Maritime Affairs PS Nancy Karigithu said maritime security is crucial for the development of the blue economy in Kenya. The two-day forum brought together at least 20 member states of the Djibouti Code of Conduct signed in 2009. It addressed the challenges of law enforcement. “We need to show tangible outputs,” the PS said. Edited by R.Wamochie
