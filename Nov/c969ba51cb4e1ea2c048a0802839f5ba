Two suspects linked to the murder of Catholic priest Michael Kyengo will be arraigned at the Embu high court on Monday. Following court orders, Kavivya Mwangangi and Michael Muthini Mutunga will still remain in police custody until Monday when they will take plea. The decision of the court comes following a request by the investigating officers where they sought one more day to detain the duo to allow the completion of the probe. In their application, the investigating officers sought more time to travel to Embu for further investigations. Appearing before magistrate Paul Mayova, they also sought more time to consult with the Embu DCI officers before charging the two suspects. Muthini has already spent 10 days in police custody while Mwangangi has spent eight days in police custody. The eight-day detention comes even after Mwangangi sought to confess in an open court on how they conspired to murder the slain priest. His confession was cut short by presiding magistrate Okwani when she directed that he confesses at the police station in the presence of his family and a chief inspector. In his narrative, Mwangangi told the court that he was picked on the fateful night the priest died and directed to a car where the priest was stack in the booth. "His hands were tied and at some point, I was asked to tie his feet and hands with ropes," he said. Mwangangi further added that at some point his colleague, Mutava whom they were with in the same car asked the slain priest to give his bank account number and state his M-Pesa balance. Mwangangi alleged that Mutava transferred cash from the slain priest's bank account to an unknown account. The total number of detained suspects in the murder now stands at three.
