The High Court has given Ida Odinga, and Lwam Bekele two weeks to reach an agreement in Fidel Odinga's property case with a view of settling the matter out of court. Lwam's lawyer Roger Sagana told the court that they have been meeting but they have not been able to reach an agreement. Sagana asked for two weeks to settle the matter which was granted. At the same time, Phoebe Gweno, the alleged mother of Fidel's twins was enjoined in the case. The twins are yet to be subjected to a DNA test. Justice Aggrey Muchelule directed the case be mentioned on November 27. Last month, the court directed that a DNA test be done to establish the paternity of the two minors. Raila's family is caught up in a tussle with Lwam over the administration of Fidel's estate. In the court papers Ida and his daughter, Winnie, gave several reasons Lwam should not be allowed to be the administrator of Fidelâ€™s estate. Lwam through her lawyers termed her mother-in-law's assertions as a concoction of facts given that the said twins were born six months after Fidel's death. However, she said she does not have a problem accepting the minors as beneficiaries of her late husband's estate if it is proved they are his children. The court declined to bar the media from covering the case, saying once the matter is filed in open court, it has right to access but directed that the children's names should not be mentioned to protect them.
