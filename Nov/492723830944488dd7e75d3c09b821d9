Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o has called for lowering of cancer care treatment costs to promote access. He urged all private sector facilities that play a big role in cancer treatment to discuss cost reductions. “The government has not really put much effort into cancer. Discussing cost will remove a tremendous barrier of accessing healthcare,” the governor said. According to the World Health Organisation, over 47,000 new cancer cases were diagnosed in 2018 in Kenya and it is estimated to reach over 150,000 new cases a year in 2040. Speaking during the grand opening ceremony of direct sales and services operation in Nairobi on Tuesday, Nyong’o asked the national government to help counties understand the treatment of cancer in terms of knowledge. The governor noted that the many years of neglect of physical infrastructure in the country has contributed to major consequences to access healthcare. Varian develops advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to advance cancer treatment and access to care for patients in the fight against cancer. “With the increasing need for advanced cancer treatment in Kenya and the region, we believe it is the right time to establish direct sales and service to assist the oncology care community,” said Chris Toth, president, Varian oncology systems. Having already installed eight radiotherapy systems, Varian has sold and serviced its technology-leading radiotherapy systems to Kenyan hospitals via a Nairobi-based distributor, but now intends to sell and service its systems directly starting this month. Among those who attended the ceremony was Kesses Member of Parliament Mishra Kiprop and international dignitaries.
