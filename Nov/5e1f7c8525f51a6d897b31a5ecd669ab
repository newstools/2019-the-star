Police are holding a third suspect in the murder of Joyce Syombua and her two children. The suspect will now be held at Kiganjo Police Station in Nyeri County after a Nyeri court allowed the police to hold him for 14 days. The detention of Peter Maina Mwangi, according to the prosecution, is meant to allow police to complete investigations. Mwangi was arrested on Thursday in Nanyuki. State Counsel Martha Ndung'u told the court on Friday that the suspect had not yet recorded a statement with the police. She also told Nyeri Chief Magistrate Wendy Kagendo that the suspect’s cell phone was confiscated by homicide detectives and is expected to undergo forensic investigations. Police are out to collect evidence in the brutal murder of the three from the suspect, she said. The case is being investigated by homicide department in Nairobi. "They intend to move to various areas to harmonise facts as part of the investigations,” she said. She added that the police are yet to convene an identification parade while the suspects are also yet to undergo through mental assessment. "The deceased persons are people considered as vulnerable persons in the society, therefore investigations must be thoroughly carried out in order to have the right suspects in court," said Ndung'u. The state counsel also requested the court to allow police to detain the suspect in any station in the country saying the case was complicated. Maina did not oppose the application. Police had earlier arrested two suspects who include Major Peter Mugure and his co-accused Collins Pamba who are being held in separate stations for 21 days. They are being held at Nanyuki and Narumoru police stations. Mugure was working in the military and the deceased people were his wife and two daughters while Pamba was a casual labourer at the Laikipia Airbase. The three suspects are expected back in court on December 11, 2019.
