Gospel singer Mr Seed is set to bring Ruiru to a standstill this month at the Ruiru Stadium. This is the singer's second show after a successful one in Huruma. He told Word Is on Wednesday, "The show is titled 'Mr Seed Live'. This is the second time this year I'm doing this. The first one I did was titled 'Mr Seed made in Huruma' concert, which was attended by 7,000 people." Adding, "The Ruiru show is to inspire youths to spread the gospel across the world." Seed is targeting to perform in all the 47 counties in the country. "The show is a hundred per cent about the gospel industry," the singer said. The project came about after he exited Bahati's EMB record label and started his own, Starborn Empire.
