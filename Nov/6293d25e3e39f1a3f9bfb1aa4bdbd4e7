A businessman was on Monday arraigned in a Meru court and charged with organized crime in collaboration with prisoners to swindle Kenyans. Nicholas Ngatia Wachira was charged that on diverse dates between October  25 and 27 within Meru town while acting in concert with others he attempted to withdrow money from a Faulu Bank ATM . Ngatia pleaded not guilty before Meru chief magistrate Hannah Ndung’u. The accused was ordered to execute a personal bond of Sh300,000 with one surety of similar amount or cash bail of Sh150,000. According to a police report, the accused on October 27 went to the Faulu ATM and tried to withdraw money. Police said they established the access codes were sent from inmates at Kamiti Maximum Prison. North Imenti DCIO James Githinji told the Star ATM security persons became suspicious of the accused person and alerted the police who traced his movements. Githinji said the accused seems to have gone to a far location from where the culprits are swindled to evade a police dragnet. “They swindle small amounts of money but from different people. They participate through codes that are forwarded on phone. And because the suspect knows it is impossible for culprits to launch criminal claims of low amount of money, they establish a network to steal,” he said. The case will be mention on November 11 and hearing to proceed on December 11.
