Kagwe Mungai has released a 'single and ready to mingle' anthem called 'Single', in which he features rapper Kristoff. In the song, Mungai steps out of his ‘good boy’ shell and embraces the naughty, sensual and innate sexiness we always knew he embodied. 'Single' is a party anthem to all the uncommitted people tired of love songs; the people looking to embrace and celebrate singlehood in a bold and uninhibited way. The singer himself is considered among Kenya's most eligible bachelors. The multi-talented artiste is also a rapper, actor and instrumentalist. Mungai is currently promoting his album, called 'Spectrum', which ahs 15 songs. He officially launched it in May at The Alchemist in Westlands, Nairobi.
