Authorities in Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, say they plan to seize a lion living in a residential apartment in the upmarket suburb of Victoria Island. According to local reports, the two-year-old lion is said to be deployed as security guard in the house where it was discovered. The apartment is reported to belong to an Indian national. Yinka Egbeyemi, who heads Lagos state's task force on Environmental and Special Offences Unit, said the cub would be "tranquilised" on Monday and taken to a zoo.
