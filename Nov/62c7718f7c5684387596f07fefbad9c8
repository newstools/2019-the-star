Businessman Peter Karanja, the former husband of Gilgil MP Martha Wangari, was on Wednesday charged with robbery with violence in a Naivasha court. This comes a day after he was charged afresh at the High Court in Nairobi with the murder of Tob Cohen alongside the Dutch tycoon's widow Sarah Wairimu. Karanja is accused of violently robbing two security guards. The businessman, his brother Joel Kuria and friend Peter Maina are charged with storming the MPs residential home in Gilgil and attacking the two guards. According to the charge sheet, the three are accused that on November 9 in Teacherâ€™s Estate in Gilgil while armed with crude weapons, they robbed Eric Nyongesa and John Kamau of their mobile phones and cash. The three, who are represented by lawyer F I Mburu, denied the charges. The case took a new twist when the two guards said they wanted to withdraw the charges against Karanja and his co-accused. Lawyer Mburu said the two guards were ready to withdraw the case after speaking to the accused persons. This development comes as Naivasha senior resident magistrate Esther Mburu issued a warrant of arrest for Karanja after he failed to turn up for the case. The prosecution rejected the move to withdraw the case, noting that the two complainants could have been intimidated. State counsel Sidi Kirenge said they needed to look deeper into the matter. In her ruling, the magistrate said the issue should be canvassed during the hearing date. She released the accused on a Sh100,000 bail or Sh500,000 bond and a surety of the same amount. The case will be mentioned on November 25. Karanja and the MP have two pending cases in Naivasha law courts over the ownership of the house in Gilgil and child custody. Edited by R.Wamochie
