Residents of a Budalang'i village have accused the Kenya Power of poor services. Lwakhanga A villagers and Ruambwa market traders on Monday said the firm has failed to fix the frequent power outage in the area, despite the huge losses they have suffered, especially during downpours. They said crime has also been on the rise. Efforts to get comments from the electricity distributor were unsuccessful. Nyumba Kumi chairman Dismas Oloo said the trading centre has been without power for the past three days. He said business has been disrupted, leading to untold suffering. He said livestock theft and mugging in Lwakhanga village and environs at night has reached an alarming level because they have no light. “Lwakhanga A village and Ruambwa trading centre has been without electricity for the last three days and this has led to increased insecurity as thieves have taken advantage of the opportunity to steal our livestock and mug us at night,” Oloo said. He said their pleas to Kenya Power have been falling on deaf ears. “We have, on several occasions, appealed to the KPLC over frequent power outage in the area but the power provider always takes too long to respond,” Oloo said. The worst-hit residents include shop owners with fridges, carpenters, welders workshop owners and barbers.
