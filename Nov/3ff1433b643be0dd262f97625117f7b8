Preparations for the 2019 Safaricom East African Safari Classic Rally are underway with organisers promising an exciting new programme. The team headed by Raju Chaggar has already visited the vital areas of the route on both sides of Kenya and Tanzania— less than two weeks to the start of the world-famous rally. Mombasa’s Sarova Hotel will be the venue for the first part of the official programme of the rally that kicks off with scrutineering on November 25. Vivo Energy Kenya through its Shell V-Power and Aviation Gas (Avgas) brands, will be the official fuel sponsor of the rally this year. Other co-sponsors for the event are M-Pesa (Safaricom PLC), MFI, Bidco Africa, Omologato and DT Dobie. Chaggar said: “All competitors are aware this rally is unique and that it runs on open roads. However, with all the resources available this year, we will make concerted efforts to ensure the competitors get a clean passage and focus on driving to their best abilities.” “On November 26, we will have a shakedown at the Mombasa Cement track, Crews will be working on car setups and also give some of the first time competitors a chance to get a feel of what to expect in regards to terrain and climate conditions. It will be an ideal day out for spectators to come and see the cars,” said Chaggar, the event’s clerk of the course for the major event. November 27 (11am) will see a ceremonial start from Sarova Whitesands Hotel before proceeding to the first stage at the Mombasa Cement track.The prologue stage will help organisers determine the seeded start order for the event. Crews will tackle an 18km stage. Safety for the Safari has been increased tremendously with a total of 15 marshals who will be assisted by 60 Boda Boda riders.
