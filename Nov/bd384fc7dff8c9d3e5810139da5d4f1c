Joey Muthengi says it was not all rosy after she left her TV job in November last year. The former entertainment presenter took to social media to recount her journey. "Today marks one year since I left my last job," she wrote. "It was a very difficult decision and I had no idea where I was headed afterwards. Won't lie I've had some tough days. Yet God has guided me to the place I am now." Adding, "Today I am happy, I am content and I know that I am loved. I'm so thankful for the people who have stuck by me and encouraged me along the way. God bless " Muthengi went back to the radio station she had been poached from by the TV station.
