Actor Abel Amunga says he was almost conned by a caller, who lied that his son had been involved in an accident. Speaking during the 'Janjaruka' YouTube series, he said, "Someone called me and I was shooting on set. I was in high spirits and because we are not allowed to bring phones on set, I hid somewhere behind a wall. "He told me my son had been hit by a car and they have gotten him to hospital. It sounded like an emergency. He told me its a boy that looks like he is in form one and I knew that must be him." But just before he was fooled into giving out money, his friends came to his rescue. "He told me to send money. I didn't have money on my phone and so I asked from my friends. One of them told me to call the guy again. That was when I found out he was a con."
