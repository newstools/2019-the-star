Police in Lower Yatta subcounty, Kitui county, are pursuing a gang of men who raped an old woman on Saturday night. The woman was sexually assaulted by unknown men at her home. Lower Yatta subcounty police commander Charles Chacha said although the rape happened on Saturday night, it was only reported on Sunday evening. “We have launched investigations into the incident and police are trailing the suspected rapists,” Chacha said on the phone yesterday. He said police were yet to receive a comprehensive medical report. “It is a very worrying incident that could have been perpetuated by very ruthless people. They badly beat up the aged woman, leaving her with a black eye and other injuries all over her body,” Chacha said. Kitui county has the highest incidents of rape and defilement in Eastern, according to county commissioner Boaz Cherutich.
