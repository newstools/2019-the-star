Public property has been seen a non-necessity or misused in the name of ‘ni mali ya serikali’ (state’s property). Bridges, road signs, roads, public toilets and any other public property, however expensive, is vandalised by the same citizens whose benefit they were built for. Destroying public property is primitive on the part of Kenyans. They should wake up and realise the importance of these facilities as well as the need to have them since they were placed there for them. Destroying them will only do them harm; not the government.
