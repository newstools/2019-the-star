The GSU officer who arrested over the murder of two women in Katani, Machakos county, was remanded last week at Machakos GK Prison. Constable Anthony Kilonzo was charged with two counts of murder but failed to take a plea at the High Court in Machakos. The court Court ordered that he be held for three weeks and a mental assessment before he takes a plea. Kilonzo was arrested following the gruesome murder of Purity Wanjiru, 35, and her mother Anne Gatiti, 60, at their home in Mlolongo on October 26. Wanjiru's husband Fredrick Mwangi was wounded during the attack was admitted at Shalom Community Hospital in Athi River where he was treated and discharged. Kilonzo was arrested after staff at a Nairobi hospital, where he went to seek treatment for bullet wounds, alerted the police. He had earlier been arraigned at a Nairobi court where he revealed he was hired by a friend, who he did not identify, to kill the mother and her daughter. “I recorded statements when I was in the hospital yesterday when I was arrested. I confessed that I was called by a friend to do the job of killing the lady,” Kilonzo told the court. The court, however, cut him short asking him whether he understood the implication of his remarks. On the day of Kilonzo’s arrest, a second suspect was gunned down by police officers and two AK47 rifles with 18 bullets recovered. He gave the information to detectives that led to an operation that led to the shooting of Gibson Nyaboga, 26, in his parents’ home a few metres from where the women were murdered. Kilonzo joined the GSU in 2015 after he emerged position one in a race during the recruitment at KMC Grounds in Athi River, Machakos county. He was raised by his elderly mother in Katani and schooled in Katani primary and secondary schools. Nyabaga’s parents, Kennedy Hamisi and Grace Kemunto were released on bond after being detained for four days. Nyabaga and the slain women have all been buried.
