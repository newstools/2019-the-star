Leader of Majority in Vihiga assembly Moses Opole has advised counties to "go the CDF way" in paying contractors for projects to avoid stalling. The Emabungo MCA said contractors are facing financial constraints in taking up their projects leading to piling up of unfinished works. This comes as Vihiga MCAs are racing against time to compel the executive to complete multi-million shilling stalled projects among them a hospital plaza, mortuary block at Mbale and the granite factory that is still on paperwork. Addressing the press on Thursday in Kisumu where the MCAs are preparing the county supplementary budget, Opole said the assembly is calling on the procurement department to formulate laws for contractors to work within stipulated timeframes to curb stalling of projects. He said any project should be worked out within the financial year it is awarded to a contractor to reduce the mess of piled up projects. “We have been budgeting and re-budgeting for these projects like the hospital plaza in Mbale and other minor projects within our wards. We were told there was enough money to finish the plaza but till now we are still re-budgeting," he said. "Awarding the project tells us how long it is going to take so that when that time elapses, we can demand answers as to why." This is because there are no laws that compel contractors to work within the given time after winning the tenders, he added. The assembly, Opole said, has formed an ad hoc committee to investigate why more than 300 health workers have been dismissed from service. “The executive can’t investigate it yet it’s the one in the mess." The department of health last month sent the workers home citing irregularities in their recruitment. Edited by R.Wamochie
