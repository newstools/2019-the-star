Greensharks are banking striker Chris Wokila as they seek revenge against  Wazalendo today at the City Park Stadium. The Ben Owaga-tutored side are currently third with 23 points from 14 matches and will have to overturn a 3-0 first leg defeat inflicted by their opponents. Captain Victor Osiche said the team was unprepared in their last meeting and reiterated the need to take the fight to their opponents. Confidence is high in the Sharks camp and with current top scorer Chris Wokila firing on all cylinders, revenge could be on the cards. Wokila has nine goals to his name.  Sharks will put their best foot forward and hope for a win with Sikh Union, Police and Butali fixtures to look forward to. He said: "We expect a solid game and we hope to give our all to win. It was a humiliating loss in the first leg because we had five new starters. The players have grown into the game and we expect them to be at their best. We have no injury concern." Both teams won their last match with Sharks beating  Strathmore University Gladiators 3-1  and  Wazalendo recorded a 3-0 win over Western Jaguars. Wazalendo are second with 29 points with seven adrift of leaders Butali who have 36.
