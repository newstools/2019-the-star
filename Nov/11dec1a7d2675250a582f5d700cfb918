Comedian Daniel Ndambuki, aka Churchill, says he wants to retire and lead a private life. Despite being in the limelight for more than a decade now, little is known about him beyond his comedy. Speaking to Word Is on Wednesday, Churchill said at some point he realised he will not be Churchill for the rest of his life so he chose to keep his loved ones away from his fame. “At some point after giving all my life to the public as I have done, I will jump into a private life with the people who have been pushing me from behind,” he said. Churchill said celebrities should keep their families, especially those little angels, away from media glare  so they can live their lives and pursue their dreams. The comedian has transformed many lives by giving young people a platform to showcase their talent. He says his late father taught him to work hard. “My dad was a great guy and he taught me the discipline of looking for work and working for the little coins that you have without waiting for handouts,” he said. Churchill said that for one to succeed they must be disciplined. “That discipline you take to the work ethic and living around the people you love and respecting your job. With discipline, you earn respect as well,” he said. Churchill was interviewed during an event organised to recognise and award YouTube creators who have reached certain milestones. He was given the Golden Button Award for hitting one million subscribers on YouTube, on October 30. The colourful creator awards were presented by Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed. Google Kenya country director Charles Murito and Africa PR Lead for Google Dorothy Ooko were present. “The consumption of comedy is very high and the best we can do is produce more quality content for TV,” Churchill said.
