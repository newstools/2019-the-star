Meru county assembly on Tuesday tabled a supplementary Appropriation bill of Sh10.2 billion for 2019-20. Budget and Appropriation committee chairman Julius Mbijiwe (Mwanganthia) said the supplementary budget comes as a result of some amendments made to the Sh10 billion budget passed in July. The members slashed Sh400 million from Meru Care, a health project that was to be initiated by Governor Kiraitu Murungi, saying it was not viable. Mbijiwe spoke on Wednesday. "The project which had been initiated in other counties like Makueni had stalled," Mbijiwe said. He said casual workers and contractors who have not been paid for months will now receive their pay. Some Sh7.2 billion will be used for recurrent expenditure and Sh3.3 billion for development projects. The county's Sh993 million pending bills have not been catered for since the budget did not allocate money for them but that has been addressed in the appropriation bill, the MCA said. Healthcare had the lion's share of the budget at Sh3.7 billion followed by Education at Sh1 billion. The assembly at Sh955 million and Roads got Sh872 million. Last year's revenue collections totalled Sh518 million against a target of Sh1.1 billion. House committee noted a low turnout during public participation forums in all 11 subcounties.
