Defending champions Sandrafelis Chebet and Vincent Kiprotich will have to contend with tough opposition as they seek to defend their titles at the 2019 Baringo 10k road race in Kabarnet Town tomorrow. The race, which has attracted over 300 athletes will start at 9 am Kapaogo Aarwa along the Tenges-Kabarnet road. The race to be graced by the 2019 Chicago City Marathon winner Lawrence Cherono, will be sponsored by Geothermal Development Corporation, Sirwo Enterprises and the Baringo County Government. The annual race is expected to live up to its reputation of newcomers giving defending champions a run for their money. The race has also become a useful platform for athletes seeking to launch their international career, with past winners having gone ahead to become global stars at international invitational and championship road races. The four-time New York City Marathon queen Mary Keitany honed her prowess under the same platform some years back. She highlights a galaxy of stars that have also done Kenya proud including Alfred Barakach, the senior men’s 2019 Africa Cross Country champion. Winners of the 10km race will pocket Sh60,000, Sh40,000 and Sh30,000 respectively for the first three positions in both genders. Others in the top 10 will also get cash prizes. There will also be junior women’s 4km and junior men 6km races on the programme. “We are just finalising on some few things here and there to make the race exciting for the athletes,” said William Tomno, the Athletics Kenya (AK) Baringo County chairman and Local Organizing Committee boss.
