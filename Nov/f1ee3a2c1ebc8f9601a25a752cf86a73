Over the weekend, the WildAid Gala went down at the Beverly Wilshire hotel, where the award-winning star Lupita Nyong'o was recognised for her work in championing the reduction of global consumption of wildlife products. The fundraising gala was themed 'A Night In Africa', where she and Fiddi Angermeyer from Galapagos were honoured as 'champion of the year'. "The work of WildAid is so important because it's a re-education, a reorientation of the value of nature to us," she said. "What they're doing is making a huge difference in raising awareness on behalf of elephants, on behalf of wildlife, on behalf of human beings, as well. It's for our own good." Lupita has been featured in the 2019 series of Serengeti to raise wildlife awareness. She is currently making headlines with her debut picture book 'Sulwe', a Â story to inspire children to see their own unique beauty. "Sulwe just wants to be beautiful and bright, like her mother and sister. Then a magical journey in the night sky opens her eyes and changes everything," reads part of the book's description on her website.
