The Bukoma Beach Management Unit committee has banned children below age 18 from fishing and related activitis. Speaking to the Star at the beach on Thursday, BMU chairman Boniface Baraza expressed concerns at a large number of children who flock to the beach, especially in December to fish for "cash for Christmas". He said they are at risk of drowning in the lake. He said security apparatus should also patrol the beaches and arrest the children found engaging in fishing activities. Baraza appealed to parents to assist the BMU in their efforts to keep the children safe and away from the activity. Edited by R.Wamochie
