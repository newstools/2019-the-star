I am ready for my passport to be audited, Kenyan tycoon Humphrey Kariuki has said. In a statement on Friday, Kariuki said he will support the process in Cyprus with any requirements or further information needed to undertake the review swiftly. "While I understand that my passport is part of this audit process, having been granted before 2018, I have no doubt that my application fully complied with the regulatory requirements," he said. The Government of Cyprus will review all passports issued under the Cyprus Investment Scheme before 2018. The audit will be led by an internal committee, set up by the Government, that will be in charge of reviewing these individual passport awards to ensure they met the regulatory requirements for the scheme applicable at the time of approval. Early in the year,Â  Kariuki petitioned the High Court seeking to suspend Section 8 ( 4 ) of the Immigration Act and have it declared unconstitutional. The section calls for a fine of Sh5 million, three years' imprisonment or both if one fails to disclose dual citizenship within three months of acquiring it. He obtained Cypriot citizenship in 2016 for purposes of business. He has built a sprawling business empire that includes petroleum and energy, spirits, power projects, resorts, conservancies, high-end retail, among other enterprises. Through lawyer Benjamin Musyoki, he said he was not aware that he was required to disclose dual citizenship within three months of acquiring it. The same doesn't apply to foreign nationals, he said.
