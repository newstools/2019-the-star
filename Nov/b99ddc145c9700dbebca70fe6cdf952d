A Lamu headteacher has been interdicted for refusing to allow a candidate to sit the just-concluded Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination. Charles Njoka of Roka-Kibiboni school in Hindi, Lamu West, is alleged to have turned away Mohamed Athman Banrova when he turned up for the exam rehearsals on Monday. Njoka accused the  17-year-old candidate of not attending school for the entire third term. Banrova was one of the 3,673 candidates registered for the exam in the county. The three-day exam ended on Thursday. On Friday, Education director Joshua Kaaga said the headteacher has been served with an interdiction letter and is already under investigation. He was replaced by his deputy, Kaaga said. He said the matter was reported to his office after the first day's papers had been done. County commissioner Irungu Macharia said administrative the action had since been initiated by the Teachers Service Commission and the County Education office. Macharia said apart from that incident, the exam had been without a hitch. The bee attack on candidates at Lamu Bin Fadhil Boys Primary School briefly interfered with the exam. He said the same measures are in place to ensure the secondary exams proceed smoothly. They started on Monday. Macharia reiterated that stringent measures have been instituted to curb cheating. “We are keeping close tabs on those concerned to avert cheating. We are also warning parents, teachers and candidates against falling prey to those conmen claiming they will sell you exam papers." Edited by R.Wamochie
