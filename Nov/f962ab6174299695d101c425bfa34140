DJ Mo and Size 8 seem to have welcomed baby number two. A source has told Word Is that the family welcomed their new member days ago, and Size 8 is doing well. A few days ago, Size 8 shared a cartoon video on her Instagram. "My victory dance. Some good news, thank you, Jesus. Waa, Jesus, you are faithful," the caption read in part. On the other hand, DJ Mo shared a video of their daughter Ladasha and Size 8 commented, saying, "Thank you DJ Mo for this, when I can't really be there for her." Mo responded, "Viatu zake amesema zikae hivo na tusimletee watoto." Word Is reached out to the couple. They are yet to confirm the information. Size 8 broke down in tears during her surprise baby shower a few weeks ago, saying, "Those tears are a sign of a brand new thing that God is birthing in my life and your life be encouraged. "Take heart and joyfully prepare yourself for a brand new blessing and new levels, new territories to govern. Praise him our God, who is faithful." The celebrity couple had a hard time last year, when they lost baby number two. DJ Mo opened up about it, revealing that his wife was five weeks pregnant when the misfortune happened. "My wife was five weeks pregnant before the miscarriage. Miscarriage can be caused by so many things, like stress. Others may fail to adjust with the body, but we are doing well," he said. "If you love each other, that is a small thing. All you need is to encourage each other and it passes."
