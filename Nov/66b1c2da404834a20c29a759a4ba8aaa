Three men assaulted a plot owner for demanding to know why they had encroached on his property, a Kibera court was told yesterday. Kamau Gichui said the men, among them Austin Ouma, beat him on the head and other parts of the body on March 21 at Lindi in Kibera “I was in the house with a friend when I heard some noise behind my house. I went to check only to be confronted by the three,” he told senior resident magistrate Boaz Ombewa, adding: “I was seriously beaten but I managed to walk to hospital.” Two weeks earlier, he had found the same men digging holes on his plot but they stopped doing so after he warned them not to do so. Ouma is accused of occasioning bodily harm to the complainant alongside others not in court. Ouma, who denied the charge, told the court that the complainant fell on the ground as he tried to take away a metal bar from him. The hearing resumes tomorrow (Friday).
