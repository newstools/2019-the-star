Before the fracas started, he had taken to Twitter to announce he was in Kibra. "Deep inside Kibra. Mambo iko bara bara kabisa!" his tweet read. Hours after the scuffle, Khalwale spoke to journalists claiming that the election process was going on smoothly and that ODM had become scared thus making bribery claims. “We have mobilized very well and that is why ODM is scared and making claims of voter bribery,” he said.
