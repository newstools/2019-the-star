Karobangi Sharks chairman Robert Maoga has greeted their partnership with Sports data analysis firm InStat with delight noting that it will assist to monitor their progress. The former Shield Cup holders entered into a deal with the firm hardly a week after securing a shirt sponsor. InStat will be tasked in analysing their matches and furnishing the technical bench with real-time information on players output on the pitch. The company, founded in Russia, has been in existence for 15 years and has over 200 clients worldwide. It majors in the analysis of four sports; football, hockey, volleyball and basketball. Maoga said the partnership will be of great importance to the club which is currently flirting with relegation. Sharks have won one in their opening eleven 2019-2020 Kenyan Premier League season matches. “Sports analysis is an important aspect of the modern game. You need to have specified information in all the details of the game. That is why we have gone for this partnership,” read Maoga's statement. “InStat will help the technical bench to analyse assess and improve Sharks players to the next level,” he added. InStat Regional Director Fredrick Otieno said: “We are happy to join hands with Kariobangi Sharks. The team’s capability to produce and broadcast their games will make out work much easier. We believe our analysis will go a long way in improving the performance of the team and the technical bench.”
