Gospel artiste Daddy Owen says it is high time his brother Roy Smith Mwita, alias Rufftone, joined politics. Rufftone, who is well known for songs such as 'Tsinyanga Tsiwere' and 'Mungu Baba', has recently been spotted with Kibra aspirant McDonald Mariga. Speaking to Word is on Friday, Owen said, "He is always affiliated with politics. He helped Jubilee win the 2013 and 2017 elections. "I always urge him to join but he always says he wants to watch from the sidelines. If I was to advise him, I would tell him to vie for senator in Kakamega. If Jaguar did it, so can he." Owen said joining politics would not dilute Rufftone's Christian values in any way. "If you are a sober leader, it does not matter what field you come from. There is nowhere it is written that a leader should come from this or that field," he said. "Look at the leaders we have. Some of them are lawyers, doctors, teachers, etc. "If you are a good person, you are a good person regardless of your field. But if you are a bad person, nothing can change that." We contacted Rufftone and he downplayed suggestions he will run for Senate. "Does it mean that when someone walks with politicians it is automatic they will join politics?" Rufftone said. He said he is hanging out with his politician friends because he is loyal. "I happen to have political friends and when I believe in their vision, I support them," he said. "Does it mean that when I go for coffee with you, I want to be a media person? I support my friends, I am a loyal friend and I put my mouth where my heart is." Rufftone is currently working on a new jam, but it is yet to be completed. "I am currently in the studio, working on some new music, and once it is ready, it will be released," he said. On how family life is treating him, Rufftone said, "Family is awesome. It's a new adventure and I am taking one day at a time."
