Jubilee candidate in the Kibra by-election McDonlad Mariga has conceded defeat. Mariga, while congratulating his closest rival Imran Okoth of ODM, said he was happy with how the election had been conducted. In a recorded video, Mariga was seen saying, "Ni Mariga, nimepiga nikuambie congratulations. Kura imekua poa hatujapigana, meeting tulikuwa pamoja na pia niko ready for lunch." This loosely translates to, "I have called to congratulate you, the race was peaceful we haven't fought and I am ready for a lunch date." He said he was ready to offer any support to Imran to ensure that the residents of Kibra are fully served. "After the election, we should go back to our past life and strengthen our friendship. I will offer you maximum support," Mariga said. Imran acknowledged his congratulatory message in a tweet saying, "I'm humbled to have received a congratulatory call from @MarigaOfficial . Thatâ€™s the spirit of politics. I promise to move forward with every interested party for the good of our people. God bless Kibra." So far, provisional results indicate that Imran is taking an early lead with 3,632 votes, followed by Mariga with 1,306 votes as Owalo comes third with 826 votes. This is from 33 polling stations out of the 183.
