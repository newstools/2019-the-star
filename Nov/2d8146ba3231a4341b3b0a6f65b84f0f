John Allan Namu has bagged a TV deal with Maisha Magic to produce a crime show. Tim Okwaro, Director for East & Southern Africa Channels, said during a media showcase in Johannesburg that the move to incorporate Namu’s content is new. “We have linked up with John Allan Namu, who is a prolific investigative journalist in Kenya,” Okwaro said. “We are basically telling human interest stories that impact society. It is exciting for us because it is a new space, we have done a lot of entertainment but now we want to see how this space grows.” Namu heads an independent media house called Africa Uncensored that was set up by Kenya’s finest investigative journalists. “Our goal is to investigate, expose and empower. Having worked in investigative journalism for years we broke off to follow the stories that matter to the country and the people,” reads the website’s bio. “Our goal is to show Africa as it really is. Africa’s story is often a disjointed summary of facts (and fiction) that don’t do this continent justice. Yet there is so much to say and show about Africa. We believe that the power of investigative and in-depth journalism can be used to hold up a mirror to Africa and show it what it really is. Besides Namu, Sanaipei Tande is another lead character in the TV drama called Kina. She stars as a tough villain. In the trailer screened in Johannesburg during the Multichoice media showcase, Sanaipei character is seen driving a tractor in a field, chasing after a screaming woman who then falls into a pit. Sanaipei’s character then buries the woman alive.
