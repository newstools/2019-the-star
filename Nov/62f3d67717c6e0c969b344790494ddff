Two more businessmen have been charged with attempting to extort Sh30 million from Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi. They pretended to be investigators from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. Gorge Ngugi and Abdul Aziz Alim, Mombasa traders who have been on the run for the last two months, presented themselves before Nairobi chief magistrate Lawrence Mugambi. They denied attempting to extort the money from Kingi and were each released on cash bail of Sh 600,000 pending hearing of the case. Ngugi and  Alim were charged alongside Moses Musee Maluki and Noah Akala Aduwo who already pleaded not guilty. All the accused are represented by three lawyers led by Lewis Kanyoka. The magistrate had issued warrants of arrest against Ngiugi and Alim for failing to appear in court to take plea. Senior state prosecutor Jennifer Kaniu told the court the accused had not complied with earlier court summons. Kaniu informed the court the accused had caused plea taking to be deferred several times by offering lame excuses. "A letter written to this court from a Mombasa hospital does not disclose the ailment and treatment prescribed," said Kaniu. She said a defence lawyer urged the court to defer the plea taking three times to enable the suspects to travel from Mombasa to Nairobi. In his ruling,  Mugambi said the defence had been given the opportunity to present the two suspects but they abused the goodwill extended to them from August 26. Ngugi, Alim, Maluki and Aziz are charged with introducing themselves to Ahmed Ibrahim, the liason officer to Kingi, as EACC officers investigating corruption at the county of Kilifi when they were not. The four are charged with extorting Sh30million from Mr Kingi alleging they were investigating him over corruption. The alleged offence was committed on June 20, 2018 at Gracia Hotel in Kilimani area, Nairobi .
