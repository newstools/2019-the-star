Members of the Bomet County Assembly on Wednesday said they will support the Building Bridges Initiative only if Deputy President William Ruto approves it. However, they will read the report and analyse it before seeking the views of the Deputy President who "is our region's leader". The MCAs, who were led by majority leader Josphat Kirui, were addressing reporters outside the assembly a day after the BBI report was handed to President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga. They said that inasmuch as all Kenyans were free to make their own decisions on the report, they will bank on the DP to provide them with direction. Kirui claimed that the BBI was the ‘imagination’ of two individuals - President  Kenyatta and Raila Odinga.  He feared that it might be a trap to hoodwink Kenyans to support the extension of Uhuru's stay in power and the creation of a position for Raila ahead of 2022. “We do not want to be victims of circumstances…we shall only follow what Ruto tells us because he is our kingpin. We do not want to do things blindly,” the leader of majority said. Kirui – even without having read the report – claimed that the document failed to capture most of the issues affecting the common man "but only features the concerns and interests of some individuals in power.  It is just but about power-sharing." Embomos Ward MCA Robert Kiplangat Serbai said he was shocked that the report was only about changing the Constitution instead of addressing the serious economic challenges currently facing Kenyans. Serbai said he is opposed to the introduction of a parliamentary system of government.
