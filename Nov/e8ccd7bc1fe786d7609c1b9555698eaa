International Deaf Athletics Federation president Kentaro Shimobo has tipped Kenya to host a World Championships following the successful inaugural Africa showpiece held in Nairobi in September. Shimobo said he was satisfied with the standards of the last Africa show in Nairobi, adding that in future IDAF could ask the country to stage a world competition. He said: “ I was impressed with the organization of the first Africa Deaf Athletics Championships. I feel Kenya is capable of hosting a world event given a chance and I encourage them to bid.” In the same breath, Sports' Principal Secretary Ambassador Kirimi Kaberia also threw his weight behind the proposal, saying DAAK have the blessings of his office. “Deaf Athletics Association of Kenya (DAAK) did well during the Africa Championships and if they register their interest to host a world event with the Ministry of Sports, we will support them. They plan and run their activities effectively,” the PS noted. The earliest opportunity the DAAK has to put in a bid for a global field and track extravaganza is the 2024 championships. The fourth World Deaf Athletics Championships are slated for between July 18 and 25, 2020 in Radom, Poland. Shimobo, also the president of the Japan Deaf Athletics Association pointed out Kenya as a potential development hub for Deaf sports in the continent.
