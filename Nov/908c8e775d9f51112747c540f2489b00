The financial struggles of second-tier sides may be a thing of the past after the Football Kenya Federation revealed that a sponsor for the National Super League will be unveiled on Tuesday next week. Available information hint that a fast-rising betting firm will be the league’s new financial partner. This will come as a welcome relief to long-suffering clubs who have had to pay match officials from their pockets. In fact, yesterday’s match pitting league leaders Nairobi City Stars and Talanta was delayed as the latter frantically sought their share of Sh10,000 to contribute to the referees’ allowances. “It will be good news for the league if indeed it gets sponsors. Maybe the financial struggles that some teams have had to endure will be alleviated and the players can concentrate on playing football and not thinking of where their next meal will come from,” said Talanta assistant coach  Ayub Inziani. City Stars’ eventually emerged 1-0 winners, thanks to Ebrimma Sanneh’s penalty on the hour mark. The promotion favourites dominated from the off with Sanneh, Jimmy Bageya and tricky pony Oliver Maloba a constant menace to the Talanta backline manned by Michael Kahugi and Eric Shikano. Davis Amuyunzu had the best opportunity to open the scoring for City Stars but his effort was saved by Michael Kalumena. Talanta sole sight of goal fell to Brian Juma but his effort was blocked by the burly frame of Salim Abdalla. City Stars continued to dominate when the second half started with Sanneh hitting the upright with a header. The posts were to come to the rescue of Talanta once again with 55 minutes on the clock as Bageya tried his luck. The opener came five minutes later as Amuyunzu was brought down in the box by goalkeeper Michael Kalumena, allowing Sanneh to convert from the spot. Unbeaten City Stars remain top with 35  points.
