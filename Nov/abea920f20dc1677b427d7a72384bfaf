Fashion, commotion, long queues, tight security, finger pointing. These are some of the things that are happening at Kibra constituency, where a by-election is being held. The by-election is taking place following the death of Ken Okoth who was its Member of Parliament. Voters trooped to the polls in a contest considered a dress rehearsal for the 2022 General Election and a test of muscle for both DP William Ruto and ODM party leader Raila Odinga. The residents woke up as early as 4am to queue as they waited anxiously for the IEBC to open polling stations at 6am. Some residents wore trousers that reached their chests while others came riding on cycles to the polling stations. Others just walked bare chested to their respective polling stations while another one mimicked Pharaoh's ancient way of dressing. Even with all the fashion, the security was tight as supporters and leaders alleged voter bribery. Officers from the GSU and the regular police were on standby manning the hotly contested seat. So far, four people have been arrested after they were found bribing voters. One of them was injured by an angry mob that beat him up before surrendering him to the police. Former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale was forced to flee Kibra DC grounds after youths threw stones at him. He was seen running away from the youths who did not want to see him in the area. In retaliation, Khalwale was seen carrying a stone to defend himself from the youth. The police were forced to shoot in the air to stop some minor chaos that occurred at DC grounds.
