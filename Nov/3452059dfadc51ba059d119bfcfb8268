Some female legislators have slammed Narc Kenya party leader Martha Karua over her recent slur on Inua Mama and Team Embrace factions of Jubilee Party. They dismissed Karua as a lone ranger suffering from political humiliation. Kandara MP Alice Wahome said Karua was a political reject who had lost direction and confidence among Kenyans and had no moral authority dressing down other women. While defending the two women bandwagons, Wahome, the Inua Mama team leader, said it was sad that former Gichugu MP was against the recently formed women's movements yet she was among women leaders pushing for empowerment. “Karua should understand that the growth and space of women in this country which she started has reached another level and we wonder what message she is trying to put across,” Wahome said. Speaking in Bomet on Saturday, Wahome said their formations as women in the country were not in any way political but groups meant to promote unity, support themselves as women and those underprivileged in society. “We decided to come together so that we can help one another in inspiring other women in our regions as well as raise issues affecting us the country,” she stated. Karua is on record branding the women leaders in the two groups as cheer leaders and choir women for their male counterparts in both Tangatanga and Kieleweke factions of Jubilee. Bomet Woman Representative Joyce Korir told Karua to mind her own business and stop attacking women.
