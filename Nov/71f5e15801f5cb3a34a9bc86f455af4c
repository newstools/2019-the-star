National Police Service Commission has strongly condemned the killing of two police officers in Kayole estate. The two officers were on duty patrolling on Friday early morning near the Saika, Kayole bridge by unknown criminals. The NPSC chairperson Eliud Kinuthia said that such attacks to innocent police officers cannot be tolerated. He said the commission stands with the dependants of the fallen police officers, describing them as heroes. Kayole OCPD Wilson Kosgei said the police have started investigating the matter. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i on Wednesday condemned what he called "an overly negative attitude towards the police". He said that while the public and IPOA have a duty to condemn any mistake officers do, there is a general unnecessary blanket condemnation of the members of the service. Speaking as he launched IPOA's strategic plan, Matiang'i said officers make life sacrifices to run towards dangers as people escape and hence it was unfair to look down upon them. "Our officers go beyond the call of duty. They do it beyond their salaries to protect us. We must be fair to them and support them," he said.
