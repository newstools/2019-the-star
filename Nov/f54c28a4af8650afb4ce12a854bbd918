Kisumu All-Stars are determined to build on their first league win of the campaign and edge away from the bottom two—a spot they have occupied since they returned to the Kenyan Premier League. 'Otenga' as All-Stars are referred to,  ended their winless run with a gritty 1-0 win over fast-fading Kariobangi Sharks to give their players hope that better things lie ahead. “We have to keep improving and we will. The fans' support against Sharks was outstanding. The push they gave us brought more belief in the team and we got the late win. I can only urge them to continue believing in us,” remarked defender Patrick Ochieng. The victory could not have been more timely for All-Stars coming as it did, just a day after the Kisumu County government reportedly gave the team a six-month performance-based contract. All-Stars now have six points from nine matches and have not lost any of their last three matches, proving that it might be a turning point for Henry Omino's charges. All-Stars next face fellow promoted outfit Wazito. Chemelil Sugar, who have lost all their league games so far this season, remain bottom of the table after their 3-0 mauling by Posta Rangers.
