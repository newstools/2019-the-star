 Limuru residents have asked the government to investigate the stalled construction of a level 4 hospital that was commissioned by First Lady Margaret Kenyatta. The hospital, located in Ngarariga village in Bibirioni ward, is designed to have a 270-bed capacity and would receive emergency cases and have a cancer centre. Construction works stopped two months ago and workers left. Bibirioni MCA Jacquie Nungari said the ward has no public health facility with residents seeking treatment at Tigoni or Lari hospitals. "Tigoni hospital is about 7km and Lari hospital is over 10km away," Nungari said on Tuesday. Locals are demanding answers on why construction stopped. Muchai wa Kabue said the First Lady laid a foundation stone at the hospital on May 24, 2018, only for the multi-million project to stall slightly over a year later. Kabue asked Deputy President William Ruto to give directions on the matter on Saturday when he is expected at an Akorino Summit at Manguo Primary School. "We want the government to investigate what happened. We cannot imagine that such a project can stall. The DP should be in a position to tell us the way forward," Kabue said. "We are very sure even the First Lady does not know that her project stalled." Kiambu county government officials refused to comment on the matter and instead asked reporters to seek comment from the public works department.  edited by peter obuya
