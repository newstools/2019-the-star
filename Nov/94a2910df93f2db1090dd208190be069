Jubilee candidate McDonald Mariga has said he will push for the legalisation of bhang if elected as the next Kibra MP. He spoke at a rally in Laini Saba grounds, Kibra, on Sunday ahead of the by-election on Thursday. In two days, 118,658 registered voters are expected to vote one of the 24 candidates to be the next Kibra MP. The by-election was occasioned by the death of Ken Okoth, who succumbed to cancer. “Mnataka tuongelee mambo ya shada. Tunajua shada inacure cancer. Hio lazima tuipush. Shada si ni medicine? Sasa mimi nataka muniingize bunge tuanze kutetea hiyo mambo ya shada (Let's talk about marijuana; we know it cures cancer. We need to push for it. However, we do not want you to misuse it. Vote me in and I will push for it),” he said. Okoth had planned to introduce a Marijuana Control Bill, 2018 with a view to decriminalising the growth and use of bhang. In his proposal to Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi, Okoth wanted amnesty measures to be instituted for the removal of criminal records against citizens with prior convictions for marijuana use. "There is a regulation for growth and safe use of marijuana and hemp, including the registration of growers, producers, and manufacturers." Mariga promised to change the lives of Kibra residents by creating more jobs. "They (ODM) have abused us but we will continue reforming lives. We want to reduce the number of police stations in Kibra by creating more job avenues," he said.
