Sporadic strikes over unpaid dues are to blame for National Super League side Shabana's poor run this season, says coach Andrew Kanuli. Kanuli said he is frustrated by the state of affairs at the club as they remain winless in their last five matches. “It is very frustrating. Sometimes we train once or twice a week because of the strikes which affect my program and yet the fans expect us to win. Fitness levels and consistency of some players have dwindled,” noted Kanuli. He added that during the team's 2-0 loss against Fortune Sacco at Kianyaga Stadium in Kirinyaga County on Sunday, some players gave almost zero effort, while several first-team regulars skipped the game. Some players have already left, leaving Kanuli with just 22 and hopes to make six additions in the  January transfer window. Shabana are 10th on the log with 22 points and will hope to arrest their poor form when they play Mt Kenya United at Camp Toyoyo on Saturday. Meanwhile, Shabana's ardent fans are organising 'Shabana Night' on December 6 at Egesa East Villa in Umoja to raise funds for the broke club. Among the top performers will be Man Pepe Sagero, Bana Sungusia, Mr Miggy, Mr Ong'eng'o, Kwasa Kwasa among others. Organisers have appealed to fans to turn up in large numbers to support the club.
