Tactical discipline and game management are some of the key areas Lionesses are focusing on ahead of next mont's Dubai Invitational Sevens tournament. Head coach Felix Oloo admitted that the two areas were problematic at the Olympic qualifiers in Tunisia last month. “ We had issues in those two key areas during the qualifiers and we must tighten them not only for the tournament in Dubai but also the World Seven Series qualifiers in Hong Kong in March next year and the Olympics in Japan,” added Oloo. Kenya finished second in the qualifiers, losing to South Africa 15-14 in the final but they were given the nod to the Olympics after South Africa Olympic Association withdrew their women's team. Oloo said he expects a competitive tournament in Dubai with the likes of China, Belgium and South Africa among the teams expected to feature in the two-day event. “The girls will be well tested. The quality of teams in the invitational event is very high and I want the girls to go and enjoy themselves in the event,” he noted. Oloo was brimming with the confidence that the girls can win the invitational event in the Arabian Gulf. “ The girls have shown tremendous improvement in skillset and defence has improved. We have what it takes to go all the way and win the event,”  he said. The girls will train for the next the two and a half weeks before leaving for Dubai in early December.
