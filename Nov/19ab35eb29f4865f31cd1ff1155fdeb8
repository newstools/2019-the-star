A KCSE candidate from Narok town is sitting this year’s exams in police cells after he was arraigned with rape charges. Gideon Chepkwony,19, a student at Royal Vision High School was on Tuesday arraigned before Narok Chief Magistrate Wilbroda Juma and charged with raping a girl on October 14 in Narok town. He also faced an alternative charge of an indecent act with a minor. Juma ordered that the education office be served with proceedings so they may put in place all logistics for invigilation of the accused’s exams. She also ordered Narok Police Station OCS to provide security for the exams the accused would write while in remand at Narok GK Prisons. She further ordered that the prison authorities provide security and escort for the accused to school on the days of practical exams. Chepkwony had previously appeared before Narok resident magistrate Adeline Sisenda where he had pleaded not guilty and was awarded Sh200,000 bond with a surety of a similar amount but he could not raise the surety amount. The prosecution had opposed his release on bond alleging that his mother was interfering with witnesses as she had tried to bribe the complainant with Sh20,000 to withdraw the case. The case will now be mentioned on November 13 and heard on November 21. Edited by R.Wamochie
