The National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale has lauded ODM's elect Benard Otieno following his win in the just concluded Kibra by-election. Duale said the votes garnered by Jubilee's candidate  McDonald Mariga indicated that its the party at the moment. "To secure over 11000 votes in the most unlikely political 'bedroom' is no mean achievement. We may not have scored but that was a classic on target goal. We are coming," Duale said. Duale further congratulated Mariga for penetrating to Kibra without fear, an area perceived to be ODM's stronghold. IEBC announced Imran as a winner with 24, 636 votes followed by Mariga who garnered 11, 230 votes. Amani National Congress candidate Edward Owalo came third with 5, 275 votes with Ford Kenya's Khamisi Butichi coming in a distant fourth with 260 votes. The total votes cast was 41, 984 against a registered number 118, 658 votes representing a 35.38% voter turnout. Duale was in the Jubilee team campaigning for Mariga. Mariga conceded defeat saying he would support Imran to deliver services to the Kibra constituents. Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga also congratulated Imran for his win. Imran will pick from where his late brother Ken Okoth left while serving as area MP. During  Okoth's time, Imran was in charge of the CDF.
