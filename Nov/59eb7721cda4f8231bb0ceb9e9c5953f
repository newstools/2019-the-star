After two KRU Championship opening matches, Egerton Wasps will hope to bounce back when they host unbeaten University of Eldoret's Trojans at Njoro in Nakuru County tomorrow. Wasps lost their opening match against Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST) before succumbing to a second defeat against Kisii RFC at Gusii Stadium last weekend. Wasps coach Enos Otieno said they have to beat Trojans. “We are looking for a positive result against Trojans because we have a target to meet this season. Against Kisii, we dominated the game but committed mistakes and we were punished,” said Otieno. He added: “Despite losing our opening two matches, I’m confident we will meet our target of reaching the playoff.” His Trojans counterpart Kelvin Otieno is also keen on maximum points against fellow students. “We have had a perfect start so far and we want to maintain our momentum,” said Otieno. Log leaders Strathmore Leos will seek to maintain their 100 per cent start of the season when they host Catholic Monks at Strathmore University in Makadara, Nairobi while MMUST will welcome debutants Eldoret RFC in Kakamega. Eldoret last week lost 7-6 in a closely contested match against UoE. Winless Mean Machine will be at home against debutants Northern Suburbs. While at Ukunda, it will be derby day when South Coast Pirates welcome Mombasa RFC. Financially-troubled Kisii RFC will face 11th placed United States International University (USIU). The former Kenya Cup side is yet to record a win. “We are rebuilding the team and our target is to reach the playoff. I have several players who are playing in the league for the first time. The game against USIU has always been a tough one for us but we always beat them,” said Kisii coach Eric Bosire.
