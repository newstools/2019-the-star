Former Africa 2,000m steeplechase junior champion Daisy Jepkemei, Family Bank Half Marathon champion Daniel Simiyu and Africa cross country junior champion Nicholas Kimeli will be chasing the inaugural Tuskys 10km Great Run title in Eldoret tomorrow. After abolishing the annual cross country championships, the Tuskys Chain of Supermarkets have embarked on the road race and the trio will be hope to make history by winning the inaugural race. Jepkemei, who won at the 2019 Ndalat Gaa and inaugural Bishop Cornelius Korir cross country championships in Nandi and Eldoret respectively, faces Kenyan-born turn Turk Yasmin Can, formerly Vivian Jemutai. Can, who trains in Iten, won the third edition of Chebara Dam Half Marathon a week ago in Elgeyo Marakwet County. “I know I have the power to run a better race. I have been running in many cross country races in the region in preparation for this race,” said Jepkemei, younger sister to Norah Jeruto. “Once I heard that they are paying well, I saw no reason to compete abroad this month,” said the 5,000m and 10,000m specialist. Focus will also be on Simiyu, who has dominated locals races including the Family Bank Half Marathon, Kisii 10km road race and Standard Chartered 10km category. The national 5,000m champion will be chasing the title alongside Kimeli, who represented the country at the World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar in September. “He is ready for the race. Today (Tuesday) we did some good morning run and speed work to ensure that he remains fit for the race,” said Kimeli's coach Erick Kogo.
