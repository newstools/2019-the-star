The chaos that was recently witnessed in Malindi and Kibra during the by-election campaigns is an indication that this country has not yet developed into carrying a chaos-free election. In the past, chaotic polls have claimed the lives of many and even with this knowledge at hand, many seem not to have learnt a lesson. The 2007-08 post-election violence should have acted as a lesson to every Kenyan that chaos only end in misery for every common mwananchi. Provision of a violence-free environment to conduct a poll should start from the competitors by playing the sportsmanship role of knowing that there is both a winner and a loser in every game. On there other hand, supporters of competitors should not give way to incitement at whatever cost. It is only through this that the country will get leaders who possess leadership skills and lead in the right order. But letting politicians use us as weapons and turn us against our brothers and sisters, with whom we share the ‘smaller slice’ of the cake, only harms us.  Nairobi
