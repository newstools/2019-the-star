Kenya Breweries Limited has unveiled the 2019 Gifting Catalogue. The 30-page catalogue is inspired by a KBL Gifting Survey Report conducted in July. The study found that alcoholic beverage packs are among the items Kenyans gift most during festivities, but that they lack enough information to guide their selection of gift ideas. The unveiling took place at the Aspire Centre Westlands on November 7. Speaking at the launch, KBL’s head of spirits Grace Nshemeire-Gwaku invited Kenyans to take advantage of the catalogue in appreciating their friends, colleagues, mentors and families of legal drinking age this festive season. “Johnny Walker is a must-stock whisky for Christmas, New Years and beyond, and our range of Johnny Walker Blended Whisky caters to every palate," she said.
