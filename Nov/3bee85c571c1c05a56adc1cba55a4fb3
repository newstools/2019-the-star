The counties which feeling resentful of the outcome of the national census should conduct their own count. After all, they’re also a ‘mini-government’. Counties can cry foul but court action will not reverse the figures. The aggrieved counties should just conduct their own to have the figures to challenge the central government figures. Complaining only seems like a false allegation against the national government but with tangible proof to contest the released result, they have a better chance of getting the nation’s attention. But as long as all they do is point fingers and threaten to sue, they are just another batch of Kenyans complaining about something. They have themselves to blame for having not sensitised their people on the importance of being counted.  Mombasa
