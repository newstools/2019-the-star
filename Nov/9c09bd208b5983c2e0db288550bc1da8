Police are pursuing a preacher alleged to have defiled over 20 girls in Mwingi. On Thursday, more than 10 girls were rescued in different rental houses where the pastor is said to have held them hostage as sex slaves. The preacher’s wife was arrested. The preacher (name withheld), witnesses claim, feeds the girls on some substances after which they refuse to go back to their homes. The story broke when parents from a village caused fracas demanding the return of their daughter who had scored 304 marks in this year’s KCPE. Following the chaos, residents heard how the pastor has been preying on minors. A resident said his niece had been impregnated and the case went unresolved even after being reported to Mwingi police station. A Mwingi town businessman said he had to rush to the area after he heard about the rogue preacher and how he had taken away a couple's daughter soon after she completed primary school. He urged police to take stern action against the preacher who is still on the run after he was informed that he was being sought by the police. Mwingi sub-county police chief Peter Mutuma said they got information about the pastor from the public and he promptly sent officers to the area where several girls were rescued. Mutuma said the preacher had been preying on the young girls brought to him by their parents while sick or possessed.
