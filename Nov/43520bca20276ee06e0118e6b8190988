The move by the government to extend the tenure of Deputy Inspector General of Police Edward Mbugua by four years is timely and commendable. This will give Mbugua the opportunity to complete reforms that he initiated in the force since he took over. It is clear that the DIG as an officer in charge of the police department has greatly helped hasten reforms aimed at ensuring efficient and professional service delivery to Kenyans. Mbugua has also moved to ensure terms and conditions of services among the officers are improved especially those in hardship areas unlike in the past when the officers complained of harsh conditions while rendering services in such areas. Cases of insecurity along the Kerio Valley in areas of Baringo, Keiyo, Pokot, Samburu and Turkana have drastically reduced, thanks to tireless efforts by police in containing them. Several police officers in border areas dealing with issues such as cattle rustling, banditry and terrorism maintain that since Mbugua took over, their morale as far as duty is concerned has been boosted. It was encouraging that upon taking over the department, the DIG toured various police stations to see the reality on the ground and suggest ways of improving such conditions. The reforms at the police department that have led to high discipline among the officers in the last few months should be commended and supported by all Kenyans. It is impressive that there is discipline among officers apart from the few cases of indiscipline, which is common among a few individuals in all departments in the country. But for police to effectively discharge their duties, members of the public must support them because security matters are a collective responsibility.  Baringo
