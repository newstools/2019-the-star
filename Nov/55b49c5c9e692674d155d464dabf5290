Defending champions National Cereal and Produce Board men's handball team have warned rival teams to brace up for a fierce battle as the team returns to action this weekend. Team manager Ednah Kasandi said the team will take one game at a time as they seek to keep their hopes of retaining the title alive. Kasandi's remarks come as the top three clubs currently remain unbeaten. Black Mamba, Strathmore and NCPB are ranked first, second and third with 20, 16 and 14 points respectively although Mamba have played more games than the two. Kasandi is adamant that the improved standards of the game will energise his charges to push for the title even more. She said: â€œThis season, all the teams have raised the bar. We just need to keep the momentum and hope that our rivals drop points along the way. We are unmoved by their performance. Our commitment is to get results and help the players improve on their weaknesses." She, however, admitted that it's going to be a tough season hence warned rivals to be ready for a long fight. NCPB will be keen to improve on their defence after conceding 104 times. Second-placed Strathmore have conceded 95 goals, the fewest in the whole division. NCPB play Administration Police and St. Pauls tomorrow and Sunday respectively.
