Kenya Breweries last Sunday flew a delegation from Nairobi for the Guinness Smooth party at Simba Union Club, Kisumu. The posse included top rappers Sailors and Khaligraph Jones, as well as media personalities and influencers. KBL head brewer Kennedy Mwangi said, “Guinness Smooth is brewed using only the finest natural ingredients, many of which are sourced locally. "With the coffee and rich notes from the roasted barley marrying with a fruity, butterscotch flavour from the brewing process, Guinness Smooth is truly unique.”
