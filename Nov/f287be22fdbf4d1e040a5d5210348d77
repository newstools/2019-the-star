Nairobi County MCAS are a bunch of befuddled pigheaded self-servers who give public service a bad name. If not pursuing get-rich-enterprises, they are plotting ridiculous schemes of political infighting that have become the bane of long-suffering city folk. Right-thinking people are driven to despair by the crude unending squabbles that unfold one after another. Even before their boorish brawl in which Speaker's office was trashed by goons and the speaker threatened with violence, they were up to no good. They are at it again. Yesterday, the issue was the office of the Majority Leader following a coup in which embattled Abdi Guyo was booted out after a secret meeting in Mombasa. A number of whips were also shown the door. As usual, the assembly descended into chaos; police were called. Jubilee MCAs, unable to behave like grown-ups, now want President Uhuru Kenyatta to sort out their problems. The President should not waste his time preaching peace though he deserves sympathy for tolerating misfits in his party. The Nairobian is a poor stressed-out citizen eking out a living and propping up thankless rudderless politicians. One thing these clowns can be sure of is that the electorate is watching, it wants services â€” and 2022 is quickly approaching.   Richard Baxter The English clergyman was born on November 12, 1615
