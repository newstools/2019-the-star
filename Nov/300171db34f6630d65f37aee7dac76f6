@faymatete Hundreds of bright but needy students in Kisumu are set to benefit from sponsored secondary education by a Muhoroni-based NGO. The organisation in Ombeyi ward has been assisting needy students to access secondary education but plans to fund more students. Stars Children Africa-Kenya chapter director Missionary Joshua Auko said more than 100 students have benefited from the programme. The organisation also supports a number of students at universities, colleges and polytechnics. “We are happy that currently we have the bursaries and Helb which also help some students,” he noted Auko said the aim of the programme is to ensure needy students do not miss out on education because of lack of school fees. Head of Stars Children Africa in the US Ken Prussner, who visited the project, said the organisation will continue to partner with Auko to reach out to deserving students. "The partnership with this organisation has been running since 2006 and this is the 13th year I am visiting," Prussner said. Beneficiaries lauded the support and promised to work hard in school.
