ODM party leader Raila Odinga has asked voters in Kibra to protect their votes in the ongoing by election. "We are in our bedroom and I want to ask our people to protect our bedroom against infiltrators and outsiders," Raila said. Speaking after casting his vote in Old Kibra Primary on Thursday, Raila asked residents to be peaceful. "We want the people to decide on their own... we urge all our supporters to be very peaceful today we don't want anybody to complain of intimidation," he said. "People must be allowed to exercise their democratic right today. I want to urge all to come and vote today." Raila urged those who have not voted to come out and vote. He was accompanied by his wife Ida and daughter Rosemary Odinga. Voters trooped to the polls in a contest considered a dress rehearsal for the 2022 General Election and a test of muscle for both DP William Ruto and Raila. The winner succeeds Ken Okoth who died in July, triggering the hotly contested by-election. ODM's Bernard Okoth, Ken's brother, faces Jubilee's McDonald Mariga, an ex-football star and Eliud Owalo of ANC. Twenty-four candidates are on the ballot. The poll is being overseen by 188 presiding officers and 625 clerks. There are 118,658 voters listed on the IEBC roll.
