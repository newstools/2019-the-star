A 25-year-old man on Monday denied defiling a 15-year-old girl who allegedly lied to him that she was 18. Timothy Simiyu was charged with defiling the minor in their rented house in Lunga Lunga slums, Nairobi, from June 1. He is accused of marrying the girl until November 10 when she was taken away from him. According to the charge sheet,  Simiyu met the minor in January and requested her to accompany him to a café but she turned down his request because she was with a young brother. They would later meet and schedule a meeting at which Simiyu asked her to be his lover which she accepted. Simiyu later invited the girl to his house and when he asked her age, she said she was 18 and in Form Three, he says. He claims to have advised her to first complete school but she allegedly refused, saying she believed she might lose him to another woman. They continued living together as husband and wife. Neigbours reported to the village chairperson that they suspected Simiyu’s wife was a minor. The chairperson reported to police and Simiyu was arrested. He denied charges before senior principal magistrate Angelo Kithinji and was released on a Sh300, 000 bond with a surety of similar amount. The case will be heard beginning March 16 next year.
