Relegation-threatened Strathmore University Gladiators needs at least six points to retain their status in the top tier, according to coach Meshack Senge. With only three matches to go, Gladiators are placed 8th with 10 points having lost 11 times from 15 matches.Â  They have lost both legs against Butalii (7-0, 5-0) in some of their heaviest defeats this season. Gladiators have the worst defensive record in the division, having conceded 39 goals in 15 matches. Last weekend, they fell 4-0 to Police, leaving them more desperate ahead of Sikh Union on November 23. Their other opponents will be USIU (November 24 and Parklands (November 30). Sikh Union and Parklands have nine and seven points respectively and like Gladiators, they will be seeking to survive. Sikh beat Gladiators 3-2 in the first while Parklands drew with them 2-2. Senge intimated that his charges have to be mentally prepared to avoid giving away easy goals if they have to survive. He said: "Things are becoming difficult for us but we must get six points to survive. We have a chance based on the calibre of the opponents we will face. We are facing relegation candidates like us and we must rise on the occasion," he added.
