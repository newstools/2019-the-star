Parents from Samia subcounty in Busia county have been cautioned against marrying off their underage daughters at the expense of education. Addressing parents, teachers and pupils during a fundraiser at Upendo Education Centre in Bwiri ward last Friday, Eve Okumu, a human rights activist, accused some parents of pushing their expectant girls to be married by the men who impregnated them. They should instead take legal action against the men responsible, Okumu said. She said such parents deny their expectant girls the opportunity to continue with education as they are allowed by law to return to school after giving birth. “The law allows expectant girls to resume learning after giving birth, so I would wish to urge parents from Samia and Busia at large to take advantage of the opportunity and allow their girls to resume learning after delivery instead of marrying them off to those who impregnated them,” the activist said. She said some parents think pregnancy must lead to marriage, adding that the girls should go back to school. “If there is somebody who has defiled your daughter, report the matter to me immediately so that stern legal action can be taken against those involved,” Okumu said. A man was jailed for 20 years recently after he defiled a nine-year-old girl in Nangina while another was jailed for life.
