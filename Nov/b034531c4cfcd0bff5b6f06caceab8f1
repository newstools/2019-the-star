Kisumu county government has distributed textbooks and writing materials worth Sh20 million to Early Childhood Development centres. Governor Anyang Nyong’o said all the ECDs within the county received resources from the county in the last financial year. Nyong’o noted that the programme has boosted the learning activities of children. The county has also provided meals to ECD children at a cost of Sh14 million to improve enrollment and retention at the centres. The administration, Nyong’o said, has constructed 27 new ECD centres across the county. He spoke on Friday during the state of the county address at Tom Mboya Labour College. The county chief noted the important role played by early childhood development and education programmed in setting the foundation for lifelong learning. Nyong'o said 668 ECD teachers received their three-year contract letters with clearly defined job groups that correspond to their level of certification to motivate them. Additionally, Nyong’o said the teachers will also be remunerated through the IPPD System with each one of them acquiring personal numbers. Under the new job groups, teachers previously on Job Groups (G) and earned Sh10,500 as their basic salary currently get Sh20,800. Those previously in Job Group (H) and earned Sh12,500 now receive Sh23,780. The governor said his administration is also committed to promoting technical and vocational education and training. Currently, the county through Kisumu Urban Project (KUP) is constructing Sh350 million ultra-modern business and incubation centre at Rotary Vocational Training Centre in Kisumu city. “This will encourage innovation and nurture business ideas from experimentation to commercialisation,” Nyong’o added. He said that the enrollments in existing TVETs have increased, with 700 new trainees admitted in the last financial year.
