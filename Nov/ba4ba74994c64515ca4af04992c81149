The family of the late KMTC lecturer Eunice Kiema, who was killed in Mwingi on Monday has asked DCI George Kinoti to intervene. During her tense and emotional burial at Kyanika village in Kyuso subcounty, Kitui, the family said no arrest has been made since November 11. Boniface Mwenga, the deceased nephew, said they want DCI Kinoti to intervene because the family fears the matter might be ignored now that the deceased has been buried. Mwenga complained that the investigations are sluggish, insisting that by now, the suspects linked to the murder of the mother of two 20 days ago should have been arrested. “As a family, we fail to understand why the security team is not giving us any information concerning the brutal murder of our loved one,”Mwenga said. Mwenga said they feel the investigations are too slow and more needs to be done to ensure justice for Kiema. Eunice Mukungi, another relative, urged the government to look into cases of women murders that have been on the rise in the recent past. “Women are being killed in cold blood every day. We are no longer safe. The government should step up and save us, “ Mukungi said. Mwingi Central subcounty commander Peter Mutuma said investigations are still ongoing. Kiema taught at KMTC, Mwingi branch.
