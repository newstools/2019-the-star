The stage is set for the annual World Aids Marathon to be held on Sunday in Kisumu. Nyanza North Athletics Kenya chairman Joseph Ochieng said besides the main 42km and 21km races, there will be a 21km relay. Ochieng said athletes from Uganda are among those who have confirmed participation in the 21km relay. “We expect about 300 athletes to participate at the event and we look forward to a huge turn out on Sunday. Preparations for the annual event are ongoing,” said Ochieng, adding that the event will start and finish at Jomo Kenyatta Sports Grounds. “We have a 10km route in Milimani Estate. Athletes running the full marathon will pass on the route four times. It's a flat course and I am sure athletes will enjoy it,” Ochieng added. Top 10 athletes in each event will receive cash awards. Registration will start on Friday at Jomo Kenyatta Sports grounds where interested participants will pay Sh200 and proof of identification. Meanwhile, the Safaricom Kisumu 10km road race will be held on December 15. “We decided not to have a marathon because Safaricom reduced sponsorship to Sh1m. This also happened to Mombasa Marathon and Kisii Half Marathon,” Ochieng revealed. He said an 8km cross country race for junior men and 6km junior women will be held alongside the main race. “Since we cant subject the junior athletes to the road race, we have decided to have the cross country race for them,” Ochieng noted. Ochieng, at the same time, said the Nyanza North World Under 20 training camp at Sang'oro High School is likely to start next week. “We have been given a go-ahead by Athletics Kenya to start the camp. We are just waiting for the money. Initially, we had identified 61 but we have been asked to start with 30,” added Ochieng.
