Tanzanian femcee Rosa Ree has been banned from performing or releasing a new song for six months. Ree got into trouble after releasing an explicit song, Vitamin U, featuring Kenyan artist Timmy Tdat. She was summoned by the Tanzanian music regulator, known as Baraza la Sanaa la Taifa. A representative of BasataÂ told Dizzim on Friday the decision is meant to serve as a reminder to uphold good morals. "We have charged her [TSh] 2 million (KSh88,568). We have also banned her from doing music for six months and we hope that this teaches her a lesson," the representative said. "The fact that we have taken that step on her means that most of her work has not been following the process we give for releasing a project. "We are shocked when we see artistes release work that is not morally upright. We need to receive the artists' contracts when they get into collabos with other artists so that when anything unnecessary happens, we are aware of the information."
