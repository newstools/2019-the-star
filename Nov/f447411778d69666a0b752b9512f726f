Kenyan men and women's roll ball teams will today play the quarter-finals of the ongoing fifth Roll Ball World Cup in Chennai, Tamil Nadu in India. The women's side, under the tutelage of Martin Abunde are on course to reclaim the World title (won in 2015) but have to handle Poland with a lot of caution today if they have to advance. Caleb Akhumbi's men's line-up come face-to-face with Sri Lanka to progress to the penultimate stage from where they will have a chance to better their best ever performance (bronze medal) at the World Cup. Akhumbi was full of praises for both the men and women's outfits and urged them to keep up the energies and focus in the remaining duels. He at the same time, the coach also warned of complacency. “We started the show piece on the right footing and I am proud we have reached this far. We have to take one match at a time. We cannot afford to underrate the any team, we are all at the quarter-finals by merit. “We've been watching the Sri Lanka play and we've noted their strengths and weaknesses so we have strategized to counter their game. Where need be we'll employ our different formations that we're sure will do the magic for Kenya. We have to know how to penetrate their defense, and execute our shooting with precision,” noted Akhumbi whose charges foresaw challenges with the Indian foods and carried their own maize flour from Nairobi. He added that despite the men are motivated and have a burning urge in them to win this years world cup. On their way to the quarters, the Kenyans topped the men and women's Pool 'C' on unbeaten streak. Custodian Emily Amimo has a clean sheet after Kenya beat The Netherlands 15-0 and Egypt 7-0. Their male counterparts thwarted Argentina 10-0, Guinne 7-0, Sierra Leone 7-2, Singapore 10-0 and Netherlands 18-0 in the preliminary ties.
