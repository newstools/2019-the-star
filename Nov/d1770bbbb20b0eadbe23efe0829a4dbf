The squatters who will benefit from the expected redistribution of the long-disputed Mwea settlement scheme have been cautioned against selling their land A committee of elders from the scheme that is looking into ensuring fair redistribution of the 108, 726 acres (44,000 hectares)   has said it will ensure the repeat allocation is fair. The 15-member committee said it has given out the names of the genuine beneficiaries to the government after going round and registering them. The committee is chaired by Andrew Ireri, with Antony Maina as the secretary and Nicolas Muli as the treasurer. The committee, however, said they have received reports that some of the expected beneficiaries who live near graves in Mbeere South subcounty are planning to sell their land and settle somewhere else. Speaking to the press at Nembure market in Embu North subcounty the committee advised the squatters and any other person with such plans to refrain from it, noting they will only be given land to settle on not for business. He noted that there are people who have benefitted from government land in the past in the county but decided to sell it only to suffer later as squatters. Ireri said it the beneficiaries will benefit from joint development projects by the government in the area. Ireri said the committee will not allow such people to do as they are vowing and that it will ensure their children will not suffer due to their unscrupulous parents. “The land will be given out owing to the fact that some of the beneficiaries do not even have anywhere to live or farm and thus selling the land will be ill-advised and they should refrain from doing so,” Ireri said. Distribution of the Mwea settlement scheme into 7,232 parcels started in 2013 and ended last year. It was, however, stopped in May last year confrontations that led to the killing of Kennedy Muvevi and shooting of seven squatters by police while preventing beneficiaries from being settled on the land.
