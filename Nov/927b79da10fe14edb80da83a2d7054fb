When Andrew Githua appeared at the dock before chief magistrate Heston Nyagah he looked beaten. He did not look like the son of a rich woman he claimed he was when hurling vulgar and offensive words to Nancy Njoki at Eastlegh Market on November 8. Clad in a green jumper, a black trouser and plastic open shoes, Githua pleaded not guilty to the offence of spitting on food in a kiosk. He told the court that he was drunk at the time of the incident. It is alleged that Githua, who is well known in Eastleigh, went to Njoki's food stall with a roll of bhang, lit it and started smoking. He then announced to Njoki that if she or anyone had a problem with him smoking, they should move out of the place because he was not about to stop. "I'm not afraid of anyone. Whoever feels irritated by the smoke should go to hell.  After all my mother is a very rich woman and wealthy enough to buy my freedom if I get arrested,” the police statement read. When Njeri ignored him, he started calling her names and even incited her customers not to buy from her, saying she would steal from them. On seeing that the complainant still was not reacting to the insults, he unzipped his trousers and urinated on the goods. He also coughed and spat on the goods she was selling. The complainant then became fed off and went to report at Pangani police station. Githua was released on a cash bail of  Sh5,000 and the hearing of the matter set for February 20 next year.
