Kenyans have been urged to stop over-relying on firewood and adopt modern technology for their domestic fuel needs. Meru University of Science and Technology Chancellor Dr James Mwangi said the effects of global warming and climate change experienced in the country and world over is the creation of human beings. “My mission is to plant thousands of trees. Humans have destroyed the earth, and  we are facing climate change and global warming. Trees attract rain, absorb carbon dioxide, prevent soil erosion, provide shade and are a source of beauty but people cut them for firewood and timber,” he said. Mwangi spoke when he led lecturers, students and community members to plant 40,000 trees at the university grounds. He said destruction of forests has caused devastating effects on wealth and health. Mwangi, who is also Equity Bank CEO, said the university is probably the first to initiate a tree planting project, named ‘Chancellors Forest’. “Where we are planting trees according to history was a lake, there were five streams running down to the far end. There was a river too but due to destruction by human activities it dried up," he said. "People must take individual responsibility to reverse this. Let us practice agricultural forestry to reduce soil erosion and soil degradation. We have planted 13 indigenous tree species in the Chancellor’s Forest.” Mwangi encouraged other universities to lead from the front and plant trees in their institutions. Vice chancellor Prof Romanus Odhiambo said the institution will continually support and device new solutions to lessen the effects of with climate change.
