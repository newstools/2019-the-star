A 36-year-old man has told a Nairobi court that he moved to his grandmother's house with his four children after tough economic times took a toll on them. Edward Mwiti has been charged with disposing of waste in Nairobi’s Landhis Road on November 5. The prosecution said he was arrested after askaris during their patrol. Mwiti pleaded guilty to the offence. In his pleadings, Mwiti said he has been depending on his 90-year-old granny for food and shelter because he has nowhere to call home. He told Nairobi city court chief magistrate Roslyne Oganyo that his tribulations began way back after his father showed one-sided love to his mother and left him to suffer. "I don’t know my real dad. When I was young, my mother fell in love with a man who only loved her but openly rejected me,” he said. After his mother moved in with his stepfather, he went back to his grandmother Jennifer Kailentu in Meru county and grew up under her care. He later got married to Salome Kinya but the marriage did not last. They separated in 2012 and the wife left their four children in his custody. “Your honour, I got married but we latter separated from my wife because of marital issues. She ran away from me. I was forced to move back to my grandmother's house together with my four children,” he said. The magistrate told Mwiti that he and his four children a huge burden to his granny and urged him to reconcile with the estranged wife. But Mwiti said their differences cannot be resolved. He was sentenced to six months on probation. (Edited by F'Orieny)
