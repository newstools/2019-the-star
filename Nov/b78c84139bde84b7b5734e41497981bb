Governor Mike Sonko is expected at the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission today for allegedly giving false information to vie for the gubernatorial seat in 2017. An October 28 letter from EACC chief executive officer Twalib Mbarak says that the anti-graft agency is investigating allegations that Sonko provided false information to the anti-graft agency in his self-declaration form dated March 9, 2017. “The commission would like you to respond to these allegations and record a statement regarding the same. To this end, you are required to appear at the EACC headquarters Integrity Centre, Nairobi, on November 5 at 10am to facilitate investigations,” the letter says. Mbarak tells Sonko that the EACC shall render him liable to penal consequences if he fails to comply. Sonko is expected to record a statement with officers Abdirizack Abduba and Pius Ndiwa. This is the third time Sonko will have appeared before EACC this year. His last visit, accompanied by lawyer Cecil Miller, was on September 3. It lasted nearly eight hours. He was questioned over tender awarded to private companies to collect garbage in the city. He was with East African Legislative Assembly MP Simon Mbugua, City Hall’s chief of staff Peter Mugo and a few MCAs among them Majority leader Abdi Hassan. EACC is probing claims of corruption in the award of Sh357 million tenders for the financial year 2017-18. On August 1, Sonko had appeared at the Integrity Centre following a July 30 letter from Mbarak. He was questioned over remarks he made against Nairobi Woman Rep Esther Passaris on Madaraka Day over her unpaid per diem for a trip she made to New York.
