The government has maintained all the families affected by the West Pokot landslides will be supported. Through Deputy President William Ruto, the government on Monday said it is mobilising resources to help all victims. Ruto said the government regrets that many lives have been lost in the incident. The Saturday night landslides that hit Tapach, Weiwei and Batei Wards have left 53 people dead. “The government is working closely with various agencies to ensure that we do not lose more lives,” he said. Ruto spoke on Monday at Kapenguria County Teaching and Referral Hospital where he visited patients and victims of the tragedy. He was accompanied by West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, MPs Samuel Moroto (Kapenguria), Peter Lochakapong (Sigor), Mark Lomunokol (Kacheliba), David Pkosing (Pokot South) and Woman Representative Lilian Cheptoo. “The government would support all the affected families. We have deployed an extra helicopter to help in terms of logistics," he said. He said some 40 doctors from the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital have been mobilised to attend to the survivors of the tragedy. Governor Lonyangapuo noted that the situation was dire, and called on the well-wishers to offer their help, noting that at least 20,000 people had been displaced. “There is an urgent need for an upscale of humanitarian assistance. We have never experienced a disaster of such a massive magnitude," the governor said. Currently, a multi-agency team comprising the Kenya Defence Forces, the Kenya Police, Kenya Red Cross and Disaster Management Units from different counties are helping save the situation.
