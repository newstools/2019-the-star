Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos appeared before the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission on Thursday over the alleged mishandling of tender to supply fuel to the county. Tolgos arrived at the EACC headquarters in Nairobi at 9 am and left shortly after 11. Addressing the media outside the EACC offices, the governor dismissed allegations that he was being probed over misuse of office and having a hand in the Sh200 million fuel supply tender. “I am here to give a clarification of fuel supply which was about Sh742,760 to the Health Department,” Tolgos said. He said that he provided all the files which have been requested by the EACC and will be waiting for their determination. The governor admitted that the supply was done by the Oil Libya company which he used to work with as a dealer before being elected as a governor. “I used to be a dealer for Oil Libya Company but I don't own anything in the company now,” He added.
