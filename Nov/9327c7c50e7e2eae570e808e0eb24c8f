The daughter to Deputy President William Ruto has scored 406 marks in the just released KCPE results. Abby Cherop Ruto was one of the top performers Greenvale School based in Uasin Gishu county. Her mother, Prisca Chemutai Bett, said her 13-year-old daughter has been very promising all through her academic work. She said the success can be attributed to Deputy President William Ruto who has been very supportive. "I know he has received the news. He is yet to send a congratulatory message but when he gets time I know he will. He has been very supportive and we appreciate his effort," Chemutai said. Chemutai said though the school was still analysing the results, but she was sure that Ruto was among the top five candidates. A total of 1,083,465 pupils sat the KCPE exam. Out of these, 543,582 were boya and 539,874 were girls. While releasing the results at the KNEC headquarters in Nairobi, Education CS George Magoha said some 9,770 candidates scored above 400 marks. Andy Michael Munyiri was announced as the top candidate with 440 marks, followed by Flavian Onyango, June Cheptoo Koech  and Sean Ndung'u  who tied in the second place with 439 marks. In 2017, Chemutai in a lawsuit demanded child support for her daughter who was then 10 years old. Chemutai said she was Ruto's ex-college lover. Accusing him of "abruptly" abandoning them after he became DP,  Chemutai  said she lived in poverty because Ruto had neglected all parental responsibilities. But in a quick rejoinder  Ruto said his daughter was well provided for, contrary to the lawsuit's claims. "My 11-year-old child Abby is well catered for, including her education in private boarding school," he said via Twitter. He asked politicians and "Busybodies to keep off".
