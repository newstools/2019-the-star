Gospel star Bahati has gifted fellow artiste Dennis Karanja with a car. Dennis, whose stage name is Denno, is a visually impaired artiste who came into the limelight after collaborating in 'Mbona' alongside Daddy Owen. Talking exclusively to Word Is on Thursday, Denno said he can never thank Bahati enough. "It felt like a dream only to realise it was real. My wife was also very happy about the news," he said. "I feel very good and I can never forget this good deed. I call Bahati my destiny helper. I will never forget that he is the one who got me out of using matatus." Before buying the car, Bahati had inquired from Denno on how he moves around. Denno said he used public means, which was very challenging. "Sometimes you agree to meet someone but you stay so much in traffic and the other person can't understand your predicament," he said. Speaking to Word Is, Denno said he is now back to the music scene. "It's true I had been silent because I was going through financial difficulties. Next month I am releasing another song. I had been silent for some time but I promise to give the best," he said. Speaking on his reality TV show 'Bahati Reality', Bahati promised to help Denno until he is back to the top again. "I will do the best I can to see that you have gone back to the top," he said. "As long as God has kept me on top, I will help with the little God has given me."
