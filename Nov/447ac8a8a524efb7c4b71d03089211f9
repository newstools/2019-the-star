 Doctors in public health facilities in Kisumu will go on strike next week if the county government will not have addressed several outstanding issues. The issues included promotions, NHIF cover, remittances of their statutory deductions and study leave. The doctors issued the 14-day strike notice from November 21 through the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union. KMPDU Nyanza branch secretary Omweri Lameck accused the county government of failing to implement the 2017 collective bargaining agreement and the return to work formula signed on June 24. Omweri noted that the county also failed to respond to their demand letter dated October 28 on the pertinent matters. â€œThe union is right in her assertion that the county government of Kisumu is a hostile employer engaged in illegal subversion of workers' rights," he said. He noted that they sincerely hope that the government will engage the union and hour the binding agreement to ensure uninterrupted services in Kisumu. The letter was addressed to the county secretary through the executive member for health. In the June 24 return to work formula, the county government promised to address all the doctors' grievances. The strike notice comes barely two months after the county health workers went on strike during which several people died due to lack of medical attention. The caregivers were protesting stalled promotions, un-remitted loans and statutory deductions and delayed payments.
