Double World and Olympic gold medalist Samuel Mushai will defend his T11 1,500m title today at the ongoing 2019 World Para Athletics Championships in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Mushai, the world 1,500m record holder (3:58.37) set in London 2012)  guided by James Boit, finished third in his heat to book a place in today's finals. He clocked 4:14.06 to finish behind Brazilian Julio Cesar dos Santos who is guided by Lutimar Paes (4:11.70) and Japanese Shinya Wada under the guidance of Nataka Takashi (4:13.07). The totally blind (T11) Kenyan runner will line-up against Japanese Karasawa Kenya, Aleksander Kossakowski (Poland) Dos Santos, Gustavo Darwin Reyes (Ecuador) and Wada in the finals. Mushai said he expects tough competition in the finals but was quick to say that he is up to the task. “I just needed to qualify for the finals then await the toughest part. Both heats were tight and I project a tougher final competition,” he said. Wilson Bii and Rodgers Kiprop who did not make the cut for the finals timed 4:18.36 and 5:00.87 in the T11 1,500m. Though they did not qualify for the finals of the T46 1,500m, Stanley Misik and Wesley Sang met the minimum qualifying standards for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics. Misik timed 3:58.49 to finish fifth in his heat while Sang was sixth having clocked 4:02.87. 2016 Rio Paralympic T11 1,500m silver medalist Nancy Chelagat who is guided by Geoffrey Rotich, clocked 1:03.25 for her new best time in T11 400m and placed third in her heat. She was,  however, eliminated from the 400m finals. Chelagat finished behind heat winner Linda Patricia Lopez of Venezuela (1:00.70) and Alina Samigulina of Russia (1:0219) who placed first and second respectively.
