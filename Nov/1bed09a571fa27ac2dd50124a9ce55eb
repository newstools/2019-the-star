Fresh from qualifying for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics for the second time, Kenya Sevens will turn their attention to the World Sevens Series’ opener in Dubai next month. Skipper Andrew Amonde was over the moon, observing that he is happy the team is firing on all cylinders. “This was a good opportunity to test ourselves against quality teams and we have passed with flying colours,” he said. The veteran forward said there is room for improvement and expects a stern test in the Arabian Gulf when Kenya face three-time champions South Africa, England and Spain. “There are a couple of areas we have to work on but we have nothing to fear. We have prepared well and we will be ready for what the opposition will throw at us,” he noted. Amonde opened the scoring in the final against Uganda with Daniel Taabu converting. Taabu turned scorer minutes later, crossing the whitewash and converting his own try for a 14-0 score at the interval. On resumption, Oscar Dennis scored Shujaa’s third try. Dennis was on the mark yet again seconds later, weaving his way past a static Uganda defence. Vice-captain Jeff Oluoch then rounded off the scoring at the final whistle. In the semis, Kenya thrashed Madagascar 40-14 with Alvin Otieno scoring a brace as Vincent Onyala, Nelson Oyoo, Bush Meals and Willy Ambala scored a try each. Both teams were tied 14-14 at the interval. Kenya had earlier seen off Uganda 24-7, Namibia 33-0, Senegal (50-0) and Ivory Coast (36-7) in the pool stage. The team returned to the country last evening and will resume training later in the week.
