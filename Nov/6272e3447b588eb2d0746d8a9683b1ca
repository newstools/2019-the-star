Directorate of Criminal Investigation detectives on Tuesday arrested a man caught on CCTV assaulting a female security guard. The assault happened in Komarock. Justus Kamoja, 30, will be arraigned on Wednesday. The video of Kamoja assaulting the guard went viral on Monday. DCI advised the guard to make a formal complaint against the man. Private Security Workers Union secretary general Isaac Andabwa condemned the attack. "The man should be arrested and face the wrath of the law," he said. Isaac added that the private security sector needs reforms in order in order to gain respect from the public and its employers. A similar attack happened during the weekend where a supervisor at Eastmatt supermarket assaulted an employee. Ibrahim Taraiya, the supermarket supervisor captured assaulting a female cashier, was arrested on Saturday and detained for 10 days. This is after the  Office of the Director of Public Prosecution on Monday opposed his bail application on grounds that he will interfere with the investigation. Taraiya, a supervisor at Eastmatt supermarket in Kajiado county, was captured physically assaulting the cashier named Sara Atieno.
