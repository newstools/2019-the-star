The government has put on notice millers of the five maize brands linked to aflatoxin contamination still selling the flour in the country's markets. Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri said the ministry is aware that some millers of the listed maize flour have resorted to lowering prices so as to clear their stocks. Appearing before the National Assembly Agriculture Committee on Wednesday, Kiunjuri said the government will take stern action against any of the five millers who are yet to comply with the Kebs direction to recall the contaminated brands of the maize flour. The affected millers are Dola Maize Meal, Kifaru Maize Meal, Starehe Maize Meal, 210 Two Ten Maize Meal, and Jembe Maize Meal. Kebs said it's Market Surveillance Department team identified that the five listed products have high levels of aflatoxin. The agency said affected manufacturers are required to institute corrective actions before being confirmed by its officials' failure to which the agency will revoke their licenses. The CSÂ  noted they are doing random check to ensure no brand listed by KEBS is sold to Kenyans. "We have established that some of the millers are selling maize at lower prices to clear their stock. We must take tough actions on these millers," Kiunjuri said.
