A Congolese national was on Tuesday arrested at JKIA by DCI detectives who were working jointly with Immigration DepartmentÂ officers. Ledivin Mupanga was nabbed on arrival from Ethiopia following a stop order that had been placed by Serious Crime Detectives. The 41-year-old suspect is accused of obtaining Sh10 million in March this year from a complainant with the false promise that he could purchase gold for him and thereafter disappeared. Mupanga is in lawful custody awaiting arraignment in court on Wednesday. Further investigations are ongoing. In May, a Bulgarian national and a Kenyan suspected to be involved in a fake gold scam were charged with obtaining Sh3 million from a trader by falsely pretending they could sell him 10kg of gold. Yulian Stankov Petrov alias Vikta Rosta, a Bulgarian, and Mohammed Akabar Rashi alias Ammit Gathi, a Kenyan, pleaded not guilty to the fraud charge before Milimani Senior Resident magistrate Caroline Nzibe. The magistrate released Rashi on a bond of Sh500,000 or a cash bail of Sh100,000, while Yulian was ordered to remain in custody until the hearing of the case
