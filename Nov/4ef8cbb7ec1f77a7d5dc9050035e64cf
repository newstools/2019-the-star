It is very disheartening to learn that some legislators are saying they have no apologies to make over what happened in Kibra during the just concluded by-election. Jubilee MPs and supporters were intimidated and harassed in broad daylight. Some ODM MPs were even watching as their goons roughed up Jubilee representatives. Many Kenyans were dismayed by these actions and the immediate call was immediate arrests. To hear ODM MPs and party officials, at their thanksgiving rally in Kibra, say that they have no apologies to make is discouraging. I just want them to know that without apologies, there will be no Building Bridges Initiative. I repeat, no apologies, no Building Bridges Initiative. The Building Bridges Initiative was supposed to offer solutions to electoral problems like those, but the ODM team seems to entrench them. I was once attacked by goons when I was with Kimilili MP Didmas Barasa. We were in Kimilili town campaigning for Jubilee during the 2017 elections when goons hired by our rivals descended on us. I am still pained when I remember it. It has again happened to Barasa. How can one be attacked before the Handshake and after the Handshake. This just means that the BBI, a product of the Handshake might be doomed if our counterparts continue to behave that way. Leaders should create an environment for healing after an election, but our competitors are maintaining that they say they cannot make an apology for the political thuggery in Kibra. They were behind all the negative things that happened in Kibra but they seem to be chest-thumping about it. I am in shock that some are even making fun of the violence meted upon Barasa and former Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale. It is public knowledge that I was not in support of the Jubilee candidate McDonald Mariga, but we should give everyone a chance to campaign freely anywhere. The Gatundu South MP spoke to the Star.
