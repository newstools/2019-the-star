Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has condemned what he called "an overly negative attitude towards the police". Matiang'i on Wednesday said that while the public and IPOA have a duty to condemn any mistake officers do, there is a general unnecessary blanket condemnation of the members of the service. Speaking as he launched IPOA's strategic plan, Matiang'i said officers make life sacrifices to run towards dangers as people escape and hence it was unfair to look down upon them. "Our officers go beyond the call of duty. They do it beyond their salaries to protect us. We must be fair to them and support them," he said. He pledged support to the civilian police oversight body, asserting the government aims to achieve accountable policing. He also vowed a productive working relationship with civil society organisation in ensuring the right of the members of the public are observed in policing.
