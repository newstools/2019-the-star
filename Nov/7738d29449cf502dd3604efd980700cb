The Kenya Society for the Blind has said that at least 38,000 children with visual impairments have no access to education. The society’s executive director Juliana Kivasu said out of 45,000 recorded cases only 7,000 had been enrolled for studies. This translates to about two out of ten children. Kivasu blamed the situation on costly learning materials which most parents or guardians cannot afford. She called for concerted efforts to help enrol more children for studies. The director said they are concerned about the high numbers out school hence the need for more sensitisation to be done across the country. “The figures that we have are high but we believe there are more cases that have not been recorded because some parents hide children with such disabilities,” she said. Kivasu spoke in Bomet county on Thursday during a disability mainstreaming workshop. She urged the government to put more funds towards putting up more learning centres and acquiring learning materials for the group. Bomet chief officer for Gender, Youth and Social Services Jayne Sigilai said that the administration has an agreement with the society to establish a rehabilitation centre for the physically challenged in the county. Sigilai said that the county has purchased a 13-acre piece of land for construction of the centre. “We have plans to put up a structure that will aid in the rehabilitating all kinds of special needs among the affected persons in our county,” she said. Assistant director for social services Paul Kimetto said only 10 facilities for children with special needs are in the county; two of which are for the visually impaired. Kimetto said that the partnership will be of great benefit to children with disabilities. KSB Bomet branch chairman Wilson Keter decried moves by some parents to hide children with special needs. He called for awareness creation and proper sensitisation on the need to bring up the vulnerable group.
