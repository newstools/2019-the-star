The Njuri Ncheke council of elders has appealed to Chief Justice David Maraga to transfer land dispute cases to the elder’s shrines for resolution. The elders said the backlog of cases in the Meru law courts is contributed to by many litigants seeking land resolutions in court. Kaberia Limuki of Tigania West Shrine said 95 per cent of cases are land related and exuded confidence that the elders can resolve them. “We are aware there are so many land dispute cases leading to huge backlog in our courts but Njuri Ncheke has the best alternative dispute resolution mechanism to finish the cases quickly and ensure justice for all,” Limuki said. The elders warned the Kenya Defence Forces against evicting residents of Tigania to get more land for KDF use. “The 78 battalion is within Tigania East and West and we want to appeal to Defence CS Rachael Omamo that KDF should desist from interfering or interrupting the daily living of residents. Let them be satisfied with the 793 acres they own,” said Thiankei M’Mucheke. Recently, Meru presiding Judge Afred Mabeya on Wednesday lamented that the government’s delay in undertaking land adjudication process in Meru and particularly Igembe region has fueled land disputes leading to alarming murder incidents. Justice Mabeya noted that over 500 murder cases filed in the court arise from the Igembe region. Justice Mabeya noted the county government had made good effort on land demarcation and adjudication so that area residents can get land ownership tittle deeds.
