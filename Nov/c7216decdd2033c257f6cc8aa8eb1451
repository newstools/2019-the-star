Delegates from different parts of the world converged at the KICC this week to participate in the 25th International Conference on Population and Development. They came clad in attire that showcased their different cultural backgrounds for the conference, which started on Tuesday and will end on Thursday. The conference is organised by the Kenyan and Danish governments to mobilise the political will and financing needed to implement the ICPD Programme of Action. Matters to be discussed include universal access to sexual and reproductive health rights as part of UHC, financing to realise the programme of action and ending gender violence.
