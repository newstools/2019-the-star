Yes, everyone with a KRA pin should file returns. A PIN is a Personal Identification Number used while doing business with Kenya Revenue Authority, other Government agencies and service providers. Tax returns are only filed for the year ended. For example, if you are filing your Individual Income Tax Returns, you can file for a particular year of income, anytime between 1st January to 30th June of the following year. You are required to have a PIN if you are employed, in business, have rental income, wish to apply for a HELB Loan. Kenya operates on a self-assessment tax regime where each individual or businesses voluntarily declares their income received during the year and settles the resultant tax liability, if it exists. Where one did not accrue any income, then the law allows the taxpayer to file a nil return. What is the penalty for late filing and paying? Individual Income Tax Returns should be filed on or before 30th June of the following year. The penalty on late filing is usually on whichever is higher between, 5% of the tax due or sh 20,000. For late payments, you pay 5% of the tax due and a late payment interest of 1% per month on the unpaid tax until the tax is paid in full.
