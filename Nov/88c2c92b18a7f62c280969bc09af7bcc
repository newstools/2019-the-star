The Media Council of Kenya has condemned the harassment of journalists covering Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko yesterday. In a statement, CEO David Omwoyo said police officers deliberately lobbed tear gas at journalists in a bid to prevent them from covering the unfolding events. “Press freedom is a right enshrined in the Constitution and any attempt to block journalists from exercising this right is a gross violation of the supreme law,” Omwoyo said. The council called upon the the Director of Criminal Investigations and Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate the circumstances surrounding the attack on photographer Collins Kweyu (Standard Group), Steve Shitera (Citizen TV), Jeff Angote (NTV) and Joseph Wakhungu (Milele FM) and prosecute the perpetrators. Sonko was captured on live TV attacking a journalist at the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission offices. The Governor had arrived at Integrity Centre after he was summoned to clarify information he gave that enabled him to be cleared to vie for the gubernatorial seat two years ago. At the half-opened gate, Sonko and his bodyguards are seen slapping and shoving back the journalist who was trying to make his way into Integrity Centre.
