Harambee Stars rose two places to 106th in the world football rankings released by Fifa yesterday. Kenya's improvement is undoubtedly due to the draw they earned away to Egypt (51) in the first match of the 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifiers earlier this month. That result was slightly undermined by a drab home draw against Togo. The rise however slight will be a source of encouragement to coach Francis Kimanzi under whose previous tenure in 2008 Kenya achieved their highest ever ranking of position 68. Togo are now ranked 126th having fallen down two places following their defeat to unheralded Comoros (133). Despite being the lowest-ranked team in the group, Comoros top the qualifying table with four points. Their recent results including a home draw against Egypt have seen them rise nine places up to their current standing. Ahead of the Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup that kicks off in Ugandan next Saturday, Cranes (77) remain the best team in the region followed by Kenya and Sudan (128). Senegal (20) the losing finalists in the 2019 Afcon are the top team in Africa followed by Tunisia (27), Nigeria (31) champions Algeria (35) and Morroco (43). Belgium are the top men's national team in the world. Champions of the world France are second, Brazil, England and Uruguay follow them in that order.
