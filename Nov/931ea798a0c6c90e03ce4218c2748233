The Central Organisation of Trade Unions has urged Parliament to reject the Labor Relations Amendment Bil 2019, terming it retrogressive and unlawful. The Bill, which originated from the Ministry of Labour, has successfully gone through the first reading in Parliament. It seeks among other things to introduce stringent regulations governing industrial strikes, labour relations and union membership. The proposed law is currently before the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the National Assembly. Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli on Wednesday said any amendment to the Act will contravene the international labour laws and attract sanctions on the country. Atwoli noted that the Bill will infringe on the rights of workers and go against the Constitution. He said that should the Bill be approved, then he will go to court to overturn it. Speaking in Kisumu at an International Labor Organization(ILO) event, the secretary general said the Ministry of Labour had invited him for a meeting on Tuesday next week with his technical team. However, Atwoli criticised the Bill saying it will demand that members vote before a strike is called. He claimed the Bill was trying to classify services carried out by workers saying some were essential. “The Bill will stop some groups of workers from going on strike because they provide ‘essential services’ to the public. We will not allow this. You cannot use thorax to muzzle trade unions,” he said Atwoli maintained that the labour movement is anchored on the International Labour Organization, a United Nations Agency and not a department under any ministry of government.
