Embu MCAs have accused the county government of misappropriating Sh17.5 million in a tree-planting project that never was. The county assembly said the funds were budgeted for in the 2016-2017 financial year. MCAs have now demanded information on where the seedlings were procured and planted. The issue came up during deliberations on the assembly’s Public Accounts and Investments Committee’s report on the findings of the Auditor General on the financial statements for the year ended June 2017. Deputy Speaker Steve Munene said there was no sign seedlings worth Sh17.5 million were supplied or planted in any part of the county. There would be a huge plantation forest in the county if the seedlings had been planted two years ago. At Sh50 each, the county would have bought more than 350,000 seedlings of various species and Embu would be a re-afforestation success story, unless all the seedlings withered. The PAIC report tabled by committee chairman Phillip Nzangi (Makima MCA) indicated that during the year under review, the county executive had an approved budget of Sh3,000,144 for overhaul of infrastructure and civil works under development expenditure for the Lands and Urban Planning Department. However, the actual expenditure under this item was Sh17, 500,000 spent on the supply of tree seedlings procured from Kenya Forest Service on March 13, 2017. Nzangi revealed the budgeted provision for procurement of certified seeds was Sh14,499,856, while the actual expenditure was Sh17.5 million, resulting in an unapproved over-expenditure of Sh3,000,144. The report was unanimously adopted by the MCAs. It revealed that no documents were made available to show approved reallocation of funds set aside for overhaul of infrastructure and civil works. The assembly recommended that Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) take up the matter, saying the Sh17.5 million may have been embezzled.
