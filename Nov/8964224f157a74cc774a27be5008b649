A leadership row is brewing at the Nairobi Hospital after businessman Joseph Kigwe claimed he was the new chairman. Kigwe, who is also a board member at the hospital, stood up during the graduation of the School of Nursing students and declared himself chairman. This was done during the introductory session at the amphitheatre in Nairobi hospital on Friday. Kigwe stood up alongside his deputy Coutts Otolo - a former Mumias Sugar Company chief executive. "Up to now they have not sent any memo in regards to the said changes," a source told the Star. Many of the staff members have been left asking about the whereabouts of Simba and why he was replaced without any notice. Sources at the hospital told the Star that Simba might have resigned over pressure at the hospital. However, no memo in regards to the change of guard has been sent out. Kigwe joined the hospitalÂ board in June this year after two members of the troubled management resigned, citing personal reasons. Nairobi Hospital has been on the limelight over leadership wrangles at the facility. In April, The Nairobi Hospital sacked its CEO Gordon Odundo. Odundo had been on suspension for three months and another extension of one month. Before his appointment, he was the CEO at Gertrude's Hospital. Odundo is said to have differed with the board over the management of the Sh8 billion hospital projects.
