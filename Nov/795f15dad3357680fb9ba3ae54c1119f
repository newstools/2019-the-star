Defence, discipline and a dynamic bench will be key for Kabras when they face champions KCB at the Lions Den in Ruaraka on Saturday. Head coach Henley Du Plessis said the three facets of play will play an integral part as Kabras search for their first win against the bankers since being promoted to the top flight in 2015. “Our defence alignment and organisation has to be spot on in the match. We will also be cautious not to give away needless penalties and whoever comes in from the bench must add value in the last 15 to 20 minutes off the match,” said Du Plessis. he said an area of improvement for his charges is the lineout which malfunctioned against the bankers last season. "It's an area of strength for KCB so we must be secure in our ball and put pressure on their ball to compete,” observed Du Plessis. Du Plessis said they must erase the errors from last season's two matches, where the sugar millers lost 44-20 in the group phase and 23-15 in the final. "In both matches, we had our chances but made a couple of errors which cost us,” he added. The South African tactician observed that the team want to get the monkey off their back following a winless run. "The players are determined and hungry to win this game and we are relishing the challenge,” he added. He noted that the tough matches against Mwamba and Impala this month have prepared his charges mentally for Saturday's showdown. “We had competitive matches against Mwamba and Impala and that will aid us for the big game,” he said. Du Plesis has a full squad to choose from and will most certainly go with his big guns in the forwards including skipper Max Adaka, George Nyambua, Asman Mugerwa with Brian Tanga, South African Ntakisa Dukisa and Fijian Timoci Senaite in the backs. The sugarmillers are expected to arrive in the city tomorrow.
