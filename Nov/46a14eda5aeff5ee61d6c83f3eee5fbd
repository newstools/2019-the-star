An application in which Governor Mike Sonko is seeking to stop the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission from investigating him over corruption failed yesterday to be heard for the third time. Justice John Onyego adjourned the matter after he told the parties he had received an urgent call of a bereavement. When lawyers appeared before Justice Onyiego, he said the matter had been wrongly listed before him in the cause list and was properly before Justice Mumbi Ngugi. The judge however declined to issue conservatory orders and directed that the application be heard before Justice Ngugi on December 3. He directed parties to respond to an amended notice of a motion and certificate of urgency filed by lawyer Cecil Miller on behalf of Sonko. In the amended application, among the new prayers sought by Sonko is an order blocking his arrest and prosecution pending an inter-partes hearing of his application. Governor Sonko also wants EACC director of investigations Abdi Mohamud to step aside to pave way for investigations in relation to allegations of corruption and economic crimes leveled against him in the petition in accordance with the provisions of the law. "EACC and Mohamud have showed open bias, discrimination and unprofessionalism in the conduct of their investigative role in relation to corruption and economic crimes as provided for in the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act No. 3 of 2003 by unlawfully, illegally, selectively and discriminately pursuing investigations against the petitioner‚Äù, Sonko says in the suit papers. Parties will be required to file and serve their responses to the amended application by close of business on Monday. Lawyer Miller urged the court to give an early hearing date, saying this was the third time the application had failed to be heard.
