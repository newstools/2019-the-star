West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo has vowed to support the BBI report saying it presented 95 per cent of the views he issued when the team visited the county. Lonyangapuo said the report has good plans to unite Kenyans and urged other Kenyans to support it. “This report will unite Kenyans once and for all. A developed country is a country that has unity," he said on Wednesday. The governor said it was a shame 56 years after Independence, we still experience political disputes. He said BBI will help end them. “Kenyans are tired of individual political greed. Let’s all support this report to help put an end to the individual interests of political leaders,” he said. The governor asked Kenyans to accept the report and avoid going for a referendum. “We don’t have money to waste on a referendum. If there are any changes that need to be made on the report, Parliament should do the amendments." The national Parliament has powers to make the amendments, he said. Lonyangapuo proposed a reduction in political parties in the country saying the country has many political parties "that have no meaning". "The country only needs three to four parties that will help in nurturing democracy." He said most developed countries have few political parties that have strong policies to develop them. The county boss also proposed that the report should help in empowering local contractors. He said most of the contracts in the country are awarded to international contractors "and this has killed many local contractors". Edited by R.Wamochie
