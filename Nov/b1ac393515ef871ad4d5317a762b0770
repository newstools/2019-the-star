 Canadian Nicholas Latifi will replace Robert Kubica in the Williams driver line-up for 2020. Kubica’s departure was announced in September and Latifi, 24, will partner Briton George Russell next year. Latifi has spent this season as the team’s reserve driver and has taken part in a number of practice sessions. “We look forward to him stepping up into this new role, as we look to fight our way back to the midfield,” said Claire Williams, deputy team principal. Latifi finished second in this year’s Formula 2 championship. Williams’ announcement means the full driver line-up for the 2020 season is now complete. Meanwhile, Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto says Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc are aware their Brazilian Grand Prix collision was ‘not acceptable’. The pair collided on the Interlagos circuit’s back straight as they raced for fourth place on November 17, with the team saying they have since ‘cleared the air’. “We discussed together and I think that they understand what happened was not acceptable,” Binotto said. “We know how to move forward.” Both drivers were forced to retire from the race in Brazil as a result of the damage to their cars caused by the crash, as the impact of the collision broke Leclerc’s front suspension and gave Vettel a rear puncture. Binotto, answering fans questions in a video question-and-answer session, added: “You could think that they are in conflict on the track, but that is not the case.
