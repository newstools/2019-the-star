University of Nairobi Terrorists Eugene Genga and his Kenyatta University Pirates counterpart Gitau Waringo have maintained that they belong in the Premier League after their smooth promotion to the top tier. The two tacticians promised to shake up the division, insisting that the future in Kenyan basketball belong to the universities. Genga, a former national team forward, said he has a young talented side and doesn’t expect them to disappoint. “This team is just growing up. If they play more games, they will get better. I have height and will disturb some teams in the Premier League. “The rebuilding has taken time but I am happy that with discipline and help from an alumnus, Terrorists are back and will strike,” noted Genga. Long-serving Waringo, on the other hand, targets a playoff spot next year before planning to challenge for the premiership title. “We had planned to come back. It has taken four years but now we are here and ready for the challenge,” Gitau, a Premier League title winner with Posta. “We have a tough final coming up against the Terrorists. We plan to sweep them 3-0 and show how serious we are. This rivalry is good for this sport.” UoN and Pirates remain the pioneer varsity teams in the country having featured at the top level for decades. They have produced some of the nation’s greats.
