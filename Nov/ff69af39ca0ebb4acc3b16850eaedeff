Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) opponents’ in the Basketball Africa League second round qualifiers have been revealed. The porters together with Gendamerie Nationale will proceed to Kigali, Rwanda for the December 17-22 festival that will involve eight teams. KPA and the Islanders made it to the Elite 16 from Group ‘F’ after matches played in Antananarivo over the weekend. They will now compete against regional rivals Patriots (Rwanda) and City Oilers (Uganda), who qualified from Group ‘D’ in Dar-es-Salaam. Clube Ferroviario de Maputo (Mozambique) and UNZA Pacers (Zambia), who played in Group ‘E’ are also Kigali bound. Two more teams will be named from the East Division to join the group on a wild card, taking the number to eight. Eight teams will also qualify from the West Division. The games will be held in Yaounde, Cameroon on November 26 to December 1 and will attract top clubs from Algeria, Cameroon, DR Congo, Liberia, Mali, Gabon, Ghana and Ivory Coast. These games were brought forward due to the unavailability of the Yaoundé Multipurpose Sports Complex in December. KPA returned home on Monday evening with coach Sammy Kiki attributing their achievement in Madagascar to hard work. The tactician hailed his players for the feat, saying they played well throughout the tournament and that is why they emerged winners. KPA were placed top in the five-team festival in the Indian Ocean Island where they won all their four matches, dominating in all but one.
