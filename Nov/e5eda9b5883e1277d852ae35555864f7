Kisumu RFC coach Brain Makalama will use their opening four matches to determine the direction they want to take ahead of next month's transfer window. The Kenya Cup returnees have so far played two matches, falling 89-0 to Kabras before recovering to a beat Nondescripts in a 19-17 win. “We are struggling in some positions but I will make a final decision after four matches. If we decide to sign some players in the December window, we must go for young players,” said Makalama, a former Uganda Under-19 coach. Speaking after team training at the Kenya Polytechnic yesterday, he said: “We got a rude welcome when a very physical Kabras thrashed us 89-9 but I'm happy the boys bounced back against Nondescripts. "In the game against Nondies, the boys showed character and determination. We want to build on that because we have a target of maintaining our status in Kenya Cup.” He added: “We have now played away and at home. This weekend, we are playing Mwamba in Nairobi but I have asked my boys not to be scared even though Mwamba are a very strong and experienced team. We look forward to learning from them.” Kisumu are seventh on the log with four points while Western Bulls lie 10th with a single point. Kenya Harlequins are bottom without a point. At the same time, Western Bulls will this weekend be looking for their first win of the season. Bulls, making their Kenya Cup return, will be away against Kenya Harlequins. Bulls have lost their two opening games against Kenya Cup champions Kenya Commercial Bank and Menengai Oilers.
