The fighting spirit displayed by Mathare United in fending off a late charge from Sony Sugar last weekend to claim back-to-back wins for the first time this season has impressed coach Salim Ali. Mathare held off a spirited fight-back from Sony Sugar to claim a 3-2 win in Awendo and  Ali has praised his charges for their never-wavering attitude at the Green Stadium. “The boys were magnificent on Sunday in their attitude to never give up and kept fighting for the win until the final minute and I am honestly proud of their resilience,” Salim said on the clubs official portal. Youngsters, Chris Oduor, Daniel Otieno and Klinsman Omulanga scored in an explosive second half that accounted for all five goals with the Millers getting their goals through Samuel Onyango and Salim Chacha. Omulanga’s winner came in the 91st minute after it looked like the Slum Boys were going to share the spoils for the sixth time this season. “It is the first time we are winning back-to-back and the manner in which we have done it shows the hunger within the squad. I was not, however, particularly impressed with our defence but overall, in general, it was a good performance from the boys and I do understand the fact that we playing three games in the space of 10 days can have a toll on the players,” remarked Salim. Salim also touched on the upcoming international break which he feels brings with it both positives and negatives for his team. “We take an almost two-week break from now and on one side I am happy because it will give the lads some time off to rest and for me to go back to the drawing board and iron out some details. But on the other hand, it halts the momentum as we are in a good place. But all in all, it is in the nature of the game,” he said. Unbeaten Mathare are fourth on the KPL log with 17 points, tied with two other teams and just a point adrift of top spot occupied by Gor Mahia. They have a home tie against Sofapaka at Moi Stadium, Kasarani on November 20.
