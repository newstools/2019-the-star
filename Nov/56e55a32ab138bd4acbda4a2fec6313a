The Nandi county government has protested against being listed among devolved units with millions of shillings in pending bills. County Finance executive Alfred Lagat said most of the Sh1.3 billion bills failed to meet statutory procurement requirements or the projects quoted didn’t exist. Lagat said they already settled bills totaling to Sh629 million while the remaining Sh262  million is catered for in the proposed supplementary budget. Nandi county will also complete construction of the stalled three-storey headquarters allocating Sh35 million in the  budget. Lagat said the contractor is already on site to complete the headquarters that stalled after Cleophas Lagat, a former governor,lost in the 2017 General Election. “The county is also completing stalled Kipchoge Keino stadium after allocating Sh40 million for its completion during the current financial year,” Lagat said. The stadium named after legendary athlete was also abandoned  after former governor Lagat lost in the polls. Treasury placed Nandi among 15 county who have failed to settle their pending bills and  may be blocked from accessing development funds from January 2020 if they don't clear the arrears. Contractors and suppliers had sought court  interventions over their pending bills that date back to 2014. However, they were directed to seek arbitration instead and went back to the county government. “No money should be blocked by the National Treasury because we already  paid and are in the process of clearing the remaining  within the current supplementary estimates at the assembly,”  CEC Lagat explained. The county has budgeted for Sh145 million for the bills, with the departments of Agriculture and Roads topping with pending bills.
