Sofapaka coach John Baraza has admitted that the impending knee surgery to his fast-rising midfielder Brian Magonya is a massive blow to his title ambitions this season. Magonya, alongside teammate Tevin Omutere, is set to go under the knife after picking injuries which have left their coach a worried man. Baraza took over the reins two weeks ago from his sacked Portuguese boss Divaldo Alves and has since registered one hundred per cent record. "Truth be told, we will miss Magonya, who has been arguably our best creative midfielder. We have to adapt to playing without him. It would have been an advantage to have him around as far as our targets are concerned. It has always been our dream to win our second league title but we will still give a spirited onslaught this season," said the former Harambee Stars striker. In his return as coach, Baraza has humbled Wazito 2-1, ended Mathare United's unbeaten run in a 1-0 win last week and were 2-1 winners over Zoo Kericho over the weekend. Baraza, in the meantime, revealed that the team regained it's winning momentum courtesy of the decision to allow players to express themselves freely on the pitch. Under Alves, Sofapaka had registered a paltry two wins in eight matches inflicting a dent to their title hopes but Baraza has credited their recent resurgence to his players. "I have let them have the luxury of freedom on the pitch. This has instilled confidence in them and hard work is also rife. They work as a unit and I am happy with the progress," said Baraza. Sofapaka last laid hands on the league gong in 2009 while Baraza was still their talisman in front of goal. He harbours dreams of replicating the same this season albeit from the touchline.
