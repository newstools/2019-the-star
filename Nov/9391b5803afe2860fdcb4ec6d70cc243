 An Embu man who pleaded guilty to stealing tea leaves on Tuesday scorned a magistrate for jailing him for four months. Julius Ndwiga, 39, had asked Embu senior resident magistrate Jean Ndengeri for leniency when he took the plea. but the court fined him sh10,000 with an alternative jail sentence of four months. He was unhappy with the sentence and expressed his displeasure as he was led away by police. "Baki na Yesu na ubarikiwe (Remain with Jesus Christ and be blessed)," Ndwiga said in apparent scorn at the magistrate. Those inside the courtroom broke into laughter. Ndwiga was charged with stealing 20kg of tea leaves worth 1,460 from neighbour Joseph Muchangi. He committed the offence on October 21 at Katereri village inÂ  Embu North. The court heard that Ndwiga entered Muchangi's tea plantation and started picking tea leaves before his elder brother Peter Njeru noticed him and informed the farm owner. Ofiicers at Karau police post were notified and they found Ndwiga in the act. he was arrested. Ndwiga told court he was not stealing but instead clearing bushes to find his national ID card that he had misplaced. He asked for forgiveness. The magistrate said the offence was serious.  edited by peter obuya
