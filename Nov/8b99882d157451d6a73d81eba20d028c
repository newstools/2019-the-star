Police in Kisauni are investigating seven suspected criminals on their wanted list after a court granted them 14 days to detain them. Kisauni OCPD Julius Kirago said Abubakar Mother, Mohammed Abdallah, Mohammed Abdi, Said Salim and Seif Kai were busted on Wednesday night in their hideouts in an operation steered by the DCI. Two other suspects had been arrested earlier that day. Kirago said the suspects have been involved in several criminal activities within Mombasa and they will be charged after investigations are completed. On Sunday night, a gang attacked residents in Kisauni and Nyali leaving 10 with bodily injuries. According to police reports, the gang was armed with pangas and knives. They seriously injured two people while eight got minor injuries. Police later arrested 11 suspects believed to be behind the attack and were arraigned at the Shanzu law court. Kirago has told the Star that among the 11 was a 70-year-old Kahindi Kasi believed to be a witch doctor who has been brainwashing youths in the area. "He has been telling youths that when they take his traditional herbs, they will not be shot or even found by police once they commit a crime," he said. The officer said the report shows that a number of criminal gangs operating in the area have been consulting the witch doctor. "Some youths are involved in criminal activities after they were brainwashed by Kasi and we are continuing with operations in Kisauni until all the suspects are arrested and charged." Kirago identified the seven suspects as the most wanted criminals within the area. He said they are detained at Kisauni and they will help police with investigations. "These are the hardcore criminals whom we have been looking for for many days." Edited by R.Wamochie
