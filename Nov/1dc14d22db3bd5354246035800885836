Police in Homa Bay are holding two suspects after they recovered from them a homemade pistol allegedly used in criminal activities. Security officers acted on a tip-off from concerned residents that Evance Odhiambo was hiding at a rental house within Kendu Bay Town. County police commander Esther Seroney said her officers have been looking for the man who is suspected of theft of motorcycles and other crimes. “The man has been under police radar for a long time. Several victims of theft, burglary and robbery with violence have mentioned him as the mastermind,” she said. The suspect is reported to have relocated to Kendu Bay town from Homa Bay town a week ago after a group of boda boda operators threatened to kill him. During the arrest, Odhiambo was with a woman named Beryl Akinyi. Both are being held at Homa Bay police station. Seroney said the suspect was found with a metallic homemade gun that can fire. “Officers conducted an inspection at his house and found the gun. It had no live bullets in it but it has been proven that it can work and cause damage,” she said. The officers also found the suspect with a motorcycle without a number plate believed to have been stolen. “She [Akinyi] will be questioned by police officers so that she can tell more information about the suspect and their relationship,” Seroney said. The commander said her officers are on the ground looking for more suspects believed to have been working with Odhiambo. The police boss further told wananchi to be vigilant and report suspicious characters in their residences. “We will only end crime in our county if locals collaborate with police and report cases,” Seroney added. The suspect is expected in court on Thursday.
