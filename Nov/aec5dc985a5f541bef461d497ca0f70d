When Jane(not her real name)  was chased away by her mother for arriving home  late, the only safe  place she thought of at that hour was her teacher's house in Huruma within Nairobi county. Documents presented in court show Jane had arrived at their home  at 6pm after  playing with her friends on November 21. A confrontation with her mother forced her to seek refuge at her teacher’s place. A police report says she went to teacher Omondi's house and explained to him how her mother had chased her away for staying out late. Omondi then offered to give her accommodation for the night. But he later told her to sleep on his bed, where he ordered her to remove her clothes before defiling her repeatedly. In the morning she left his house and reported the incident to a Nyumba Kumi elder who accompanied her to Huruma police post where they recorded a statement. Omondi was later arrested and handed over to police by members of the public. He pleaded not guilty to when he appeared before senior principal magistrate Angelo Githinji. He is also faced with a second count of intentionally and unlawfully committing an indecent act with a child. The accused was released on Sh300,000 bond with a surety of the same amount. The matter will be heard on April 1, 2020.
