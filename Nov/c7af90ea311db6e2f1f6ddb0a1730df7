Education CS George Magoha has said all class eight pupils will be placed in high school​ by December 2. Placement of candidates will start on Tuesday to December 2. Speaking during the release of KCPE marks at the KNEC headquarters on Monday, he assured parents of 100 per cent transition to high school. "I assure all candidates that by December they will know which schools they will go to," he said. The CS said the selection will be fair, transparent and fast. "Parents will have enough time to prepare their children for highschool re-entry. They won't spend all the money on food during Christmas," he said. He further said 9000 scholarships will be awarded to candidates, with 30 per cent awarded to candidates from slums in inner major cities. The CS said the top candidate had 440 marks, followed by three other candidates who tied in the second position with 439 marks. The top candidate was announced as Master Andy Micheal Muchiri from Thogoto. Flavian Onyango, June Cheptoo and Sign Micheal tied in second place with 439 marks. Magoha said the number of candidates who scored 400 and above marks had however dropped from over 11,000 to 9,770. Individual candidates’ results can also be accessed by sending an SMS containing the candidate’s Index Number followed by KCPE to 20076. Last year, 50 per cent of the candidates scored over 200 marks, with two tying at the top scooping 453 marks each. Some 1,088,986 candidates sat for the exam compared to last year's 1,052,364. The exam started on October 29 and was completed on October 31. The candidates were examined in seven subjects tested in nine papers in some 27, 827 examination centres. President Uhuru Kenyatta was earlier briefed by Magoha and officials of KNEC on the results of this year’s KCPE ahead of their release today.
