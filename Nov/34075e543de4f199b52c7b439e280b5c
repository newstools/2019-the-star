Secular artiste Nameless, real name David Mathenge, says the reason he has remained relevant in the industry is that he strives for longevity. Nameless came into the music in the '90s with his hit song 'Mega Rider', and years later, he is still relevant. Speaking to Word Is on Monday, Nameless said, "When you are creating music, you can use different tactics to reach the people to get an instant intense reaction." "Other times you use tactics that can provoke a reaction that will withstand the test of time and capture people's attention." Nameless says he likes keeping things simple. "I always keep it simple, such that in 10 years, one can relate to the song or lyrics. Sometimes I stay for long before I write a song and people may wonder why," he said. "It is because I listen to it on different occasions and ask myself if I achieved the intended intention. My aim is always longevity. I do not release songs too soon so often because staki watu wazoee sana." Nameless recently featured in a new song, 'Wakilisha', in collaboration with Jegede, Stivo Simpo Boy, Daddy Andre, BigPin, JerryOgalo, FundiFrank and VDJ Jo. Speaking about the new song Nameless says 'Wakilisha' is all about representing your vibe. It was such a debate on who we should put at the end of the song, we had different people in mind but Jegede suggested Stivo Simpo Boy.' Adding that after settling on Stivo as their choice they contacted his management. 'Jegede then contacted his management and when we heard his verse it was perfect . Simpo Boy is the climax of the song and that is why most people loved the song. Nameless said that Jegede had approached him and told him he had a project that he wanted to include other artists in 'It was a good collaboration and I enjoyed being part of it, Especially being Kenyan artistes who work with other artists who want to be in the project in the right way.'
