Double Paralympic gold medalist Samuel Mushai relinquished his T11 1,500m title at the ongoing 2019 World Para Athletics Championships after settling for silver medal in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Mushai, guided by James Boit, clocked his season's best time of 4:08.47 to settle for silver. This is Kenya's first and only medal won at the Dubai Club so  far Kenya's 2017 Sports Personality of the Year has, however, not lost everything as he is still the world 1,500m record holder. He set the record at the 2012 London Paralympics. In the absence of Mushai's long-time nemesis Brazilian Odiar Santos on the track, the latter's compatriot Julio Cesar dos Santos, guided by Lutimar Paes gave the Kenyans a run for their money and ended up carrying the day. Dos Santos timed 4:07.02 to win the event as Polish athlete Aleksander Kossakowski, guided by Krzysztof Wasilewski, closed the podium after crossing the line in 4:08.71. This is Wasilewski's best performance ever. In 2016 Rio Paralympics dos Santos, 28, ran in the T12 (partially blind) category but was recently classified as a T11 (totally blind) athlete. Mushai will now shift focus to defending his 5,000m title on Thursday. Meanwhile, Hannah Ngendo who pairs up with guide Maurice Onkoba will be seeking to advance to the T12 200m semis from the heats. She boasts of a personal best time of 28.42 seconds in the distance. She will line up against Spaniard Nagore Folgado Garcia guided by Joan Raga Varo, Venezuelan Greilyz Villarroel under the guidance of Edicson Medina and BrazilianViviane Ferreira Soares directed by Viera de Almeida in heat two.
