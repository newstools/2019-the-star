RB Leipzig reached the knockout stages of the Champions League for the first time with two late goals against Benfica. Leipzig were in the third tier of German football five years ago and are only playing their second season of Champions League football. Benfica, who needed to win, had a two-goal lead going into the 90th minute. But Emil Forsberg scored twice - including a 96th-minute equaliser - to send the hosts through. Portugal midfielder Pizzi had opened the scoring for the visitors, who have never won a Champions League match in Germany in 12 attempts. That run looked to be coming to an end when Carlos Vinicius doubled the visitors’ lead. But Sweden midfielder Forsberg completed a spectacular finish by Julian Nagelsmann’s side — scoring with a penalty and then heading in Timo Werner’s cross in the sixth of 11 stoppage-time minutes.
