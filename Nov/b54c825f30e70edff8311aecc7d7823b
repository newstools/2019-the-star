A teacher involved in marking this yearâ€™s Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examinations died on Tuesday night after he collapsed. The incident comes as the Kenya National Examination Council enters the homestretch on the marking exercise that commenced at the onset of November. The deceased has been identified as Robert Kiua Muindi, an English teacher at Tusunini Primary School in Makueni county, and was undertaking the marking exercise at Alliance High School. The school is one of the ten stations Knec is using for the exercise. Knec chairman John Onsati in a statement on Tuesday said Muindi collapsed at the marking centre and was pronounced dead on arrival at Kikuyu PCEA Mission Hospital. Details on what the teacher might have suffered and circumstances that led to his death still remain scanty. "The council wishes to send our heartfelt condolence to the family, friends, relatives and the entire teaching fraternity for the loss of a dedicated professional in the education sector," Knec's statement reads. The incident takes to two the number of examiners who have died during the ongoing national examination. A principal died on November 5 in a road crash on her way to collect exam papers in Naivasha. Two other people were injured. The accident occurred along the Naivasha-Maai Mahiu Road at 5am as the principal of Reverend Gitau Secondary School in Maai Mahiu rushed to collect examination papers in Naivasha town. Onsati on Tuesday said the council had informed the family and subsequently notified the Teachers Service Commission. Kenya National Union of Teachers in a backlash on Wednesday linked the incident to work pressure the markers were being subjected to. Edited by R.Wamochie
