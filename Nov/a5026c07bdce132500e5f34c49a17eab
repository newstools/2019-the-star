 The upcoming conference on population in Nairobi should steer away from discussions on abortion and homosexuality, National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale has said. The conference to be held at the KICC between November 12 and 14 has been critcised by religious leaders who say organisers want to introduce unacceptable ideologies. On Friday, Catholic Bishops said the ICPD25 forum is targeting youths for moral corruption and urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to ban the conference. Speaking in Garissa town on Sunday, Duale said Kenya is a God-fearing nation and would not allow issues of homosexuality to be discussed or given prominence in the meeting. The forum will discuss issues of finance, health, population. However, there are fears that the sensitive issue of homosexuality might feature. “We want to make it categorical that the National Assembly has been very clear that issues of abortion, homosexuality and any other thing that is contrary to our culture and Constitution will not be issues that will be tested among the Kenyans," Duale said. He added, “So we are telling the UN population team who are organising the event that as much as we want to listen and allow the conference to take place, it must be done within the limits of the value system of the people of Kenya.” Muslim clerics and the Anglican church have also urged the organisers to respect family values which they say cannot be compromised. The United Nations decided to mark the 25th anniversary of the ICPD, which also marks the 50th anniversary of United Nations Population Fund. The Nairobi Summit on ICPD@25 is themed, ‘Accelerating the Promise.’  edited by peter obuya
