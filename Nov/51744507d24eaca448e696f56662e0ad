President Uhuru Kenyatta should direct that we complete the SGR construction locally. It would be a shame if the project stalled simply because the Chinese have lost interest. Have Kenyans so little faith in themselves and their abilities? We have thousands of engineers and workers who can complete it. Building a railway is not rocket science and can be done. Let us stop thinking we are inferior. If we gather our minds and resources we can easily complete the line with local talent trained in our institutions. Let Kenyans build and industrialise our country without begging others.  Nairobi
