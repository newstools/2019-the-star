Deputy President William Ruto has finally broken his silence over President Uhuru Kenyatta's meeting with Gema leaders last Friday at Sagana. In the meeting, the President told off warning them to stop sabotaging the Building Bridges Initiative, as he rallied his Mt Kenya backyard behind the handshake. Uhuru hyped support for BBI by praising the fruits of the handshake and urged Mt Kenya leaders to focus on their work instead of succession politics. "Why do you want to bury me when I am alive? I will take you back on the journey we have walked together. In 2007, you recall what we went through. The country almost went up in flames," He said. On Sunday, Ruto who has largely remained silent over the Gema meeting broke his silence by responding to Sunday Nation's front-page headline, 'Inside plot to wrest Jubilee from Uhuru'. Ruto rubbished the story insisting that the Jubilee Party had emerged stronger after Friday's meeting. "Detractors rattled by Jubilee emerging united/strong post-Sagana are, in collabo with usual brown envelope journalists," Ruto tweeted. "Back to the drawing board to continue their never-ending scheme to stumble us. The words of Matt.18vs6 await you if you succeed in your ungodly mission. Tunawaombea." The story highlighted how the DP's allies were keen on Ruto taking over Jubilee ahead of 2022. The DP on Saturday camped in his Rift Valley backyard, a day after the Gema where he was vocal on the need of a united Jubilee heading into 2022. Ruto warned those in the Opposition to stop meddling with Jubilee affairs and instead focus on cleaning the mess in their own political outfits. Speaking in Kericho County, the DP told those torn between being in Jubilee and the Opposition to make up their mind. “They should decide where they want to be. It cannot be both. They must plan for their own political destiny instead of being used to being division in Jubilee,” he said.
