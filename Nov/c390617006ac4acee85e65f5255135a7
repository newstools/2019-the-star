The disunity and selfishness depicted by the Luhya leaders in Kibra by-election will deny them the country's top seat, National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale has said. "Mudavadi's candidate got 5,000 votes while Ford Kenya managed a paltry 260 votes. This clearly shows how the Luhya nation is divided. If they had picked one candidate and supported him, things could be different," Duale said. The Garissa Township MP asked the community to throw their weight behind Deputy President William Ruto "who is one step to the top seat". ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya have all declared their interest to lead the country in 2022. Duale spoke over the weekend at a fundsdrive in aid of the Muslim community consortium in Kimwanga trading centre within Bumula constituency. He said Ruto's bid is unstoppable. The MP claimed that disunity and selfish ambition among Mulembe leaders was the stumbling block for any of them. "Ruto has real stood with this country. He has fought many wars; he has been criticised far and wide but he has remained steadfast in serving this country." The legislator challenged Kenyans to be patient and wait for the release of the Building Bridges Initiative report instead of speculating about its contents. "The report will be released probably this week. It will be shared with all Kenyans. Let's read it and if it favours the country we will pass it; if not we disregard it and life goes on," he said. National Assembly Chief Whip Benjamin Washiali called on Kenyans to support Ruto's presidential bid. "He is the only leader who has got Kenyans interest at heart, he doesn't cause divisions and listens to each of us," the Mumias East MP said. Bumula MP Mwambu Mabonga and his Matungu counterpart Bishop Justus Murunga also vowed to mobilise support for the Deputy President's bid. Edited by R.Wamochie
