After winning silver at last weekend's 4th Africa Cross Country Championships in Marrakech Morocco, Kenyans are now hoping to extend their good run at the next year's World event. Athletics Kenya (AK) Universities' secretary-general Edward Mwema said Kenya will field a full team during the World Universities Cross Country. “In Morocco, we only fielded four athletes and managed a silver medal. We have been assured of support from the Ministry of Sports so we shall field a full team during the world event on March 7 next year. We have done well in past editions and we want to replicate the same next year,” said Muema. Muema thanked Maseno, Kibabii, Kabianga and Kenyatta Universities for sponsoring the four athletes to the continental showpiece. He asked university athletes to prepare for the games by participating in the AK  cross country meetings which start in Machakos on November 23. He said they will use the Kenya Universities Athletics Championships to be held in Eldoret in December to identify athletes for the final trials to be held in mid-January. “We already have a provisional list of athletes. However, we shall do the final selection in mid-January. We want to field a very strong team at the world showpiece,” said Muema. During the Africa Universities Cross Country Championships, Kibabii University journalism student Benson Moshon won a silver medal in the men's race, behind  Morocco's Abdelali Aichi who clocked 30:39 to win gold. Another Kenyan representative Festus Kipkurui from Maseno University finished sixth in 32:34. In the women's category, Kenya was represented by Kabianga University's Sharon Chebet and Kenyatta University's Diana Wanza. Chebet was fourth (37:26) while Wanza finished 15th.
