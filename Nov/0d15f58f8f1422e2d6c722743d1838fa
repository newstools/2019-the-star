Harambee Starlets left for Tanzania yesterday morning, hours after safely landing back into the country from Lusaka where they took part in the 2020 Olympics Qualifier against Zambia. Starlets bowed out on a 3-2 aggregate score, bidding the competition goodbye after four rounds of action which saw Kenya dump out Malawi and heavyweights Ghana. The team’s focus immediately shifted to the upcoming Cecafa women’s Championships set to be played in Tanzania starting this Saturday to November 24. “We were disappointed to miss out on a place to the Olympics which would have been a great achievement for football in the country. It was a good experience which will help the team in future assignments. Now we have a good opportunity to do well in the Cecafa tournament and we will strive to win it,” said assistant coach Jackline Juma. Kenya have been pooled in Group ‘B’ alongside Uganda, Ethiopia and Djibouti. Group ‘A’ comprises of Tanzania, Burundi, Zanzibar and South Sudan. The top two teams from each group will proceed to the semi-final stage of the championship.
