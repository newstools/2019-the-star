The Orange Democratic Movement party has promised to hand Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala a direct ticket should the Amani National Congress expel him. ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna on Sunday said that the Musalia Mudavadi-led party was frustrating Malala for losing in the Kibra by-election. “Malala supported us in Kibra, ODM party will stand with him. ANC is pained after losing the by-election,”  Sifuna said. “They spent money, and they are feeling the pinch. As the ODM secretary-general, I want to say that should they (ANC) oust you, we shall receive you." He spoke during a funds drive at Cheptulu Salvation Army in Vihiga County on Sunday. On Friday, ANC party issued a statement announcing the suspension of Malala from the party's register. It said the ANC disciplinary committee made the decision after holding a meeting to discuss his misconduct. The disciplinary committee said Malala rallied behind ODM candidate in the Kibra by-election, which goes against the Constitution and party's regulations. Malala, while addressing the press in Kakamega on Saturday, said the national disciplinary council did not follow the due process but he would not waste time seeking legal redress. Malala also said he has not received any official communication from the party. The lawmaker added that ANC, by law, is still an affiliate party of the Nasa coalition and so supporting a candidate of ODM, which is in Nasa, was not wrong. “To date, ANC has not rescinded this association publicly or privately. In the fore stated agreement, members of affiliate parties were allowed to campaign for candidates within the coalition, their political parties notwithstanding,” Malala stated. He dared the ANC leadership to formally expel him from the party, saying he is ready for a by-election. Malala said he is confident he would recapture the seat with a landslide.
