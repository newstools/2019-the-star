The chaos Kenyans were treated to by Nairobi MCAs this week should be strongly condemned. After embattled assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi returned to duty after being reinstated by the labour court recently, it was an ugly confrontation–and not even for the first time. Ward representatives who find it difficult to serve with her refused to take their seats in the chamber and started chanting ‘court order’ to get the speaker to stop presiding over the plenary session. The order had barred Elachi from doing so. The MCAs then walked out of the assembly chamber when the speaker did not budge. It is extremely important for our leaders to display virtues for which the citizens elected them. They should show their effectiveness in discharging their duties. I believe if the MCAs had impeached Elachi on substantial grounds, we would have avoided the violence. On the other hand, all leaders should be about working together harmoniously as an example to their electorate. If they fail to read from the same script, let them solve their battles with honour. If they cannot do it in order, they should fight their ugly battles out of the public’s sight. This is the 21st Century and we should not be solving our problems by measuring muscles. Violence and physical war are outrageous, especially coming from the people we chose to lead us. It should dawn to leaders that their position is less important than the actual job we elected them for. The real job of a leader is not about being in charge but taking care of those in their charge. As much as we cannot avoid disagreements, the repercussions of messy conflicts are that our children–leaders of tomorrow– will emulate them.  Nairobi
