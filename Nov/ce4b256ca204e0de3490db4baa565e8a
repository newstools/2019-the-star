Kenyan boy group Ethic has apologised for the offensive lyrics in their new song 'Tarimbo'. They tweeted, "As Ethic Entertainment, we are truly remorseful for any dolor caused by the lyrics to our single, and for every single person that was triggered to a displeasing memory or emotion by it, receive our sincere apologies. Rest assured that no disrespect was intended." The hook of the song has some very harsh words, where Rekles, one of the members, says "I nut without permission", lyrics that fans have condemned as encouraging rape.
