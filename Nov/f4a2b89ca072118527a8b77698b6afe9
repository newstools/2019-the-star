A KCSE candidate will write her remaining papers from her maternity ward bed after she delivered moments before the composition paper on Wednesday. Dadaab sub-county Education officer Idriss Buthul told the Star by phone that the student was rushed to MSF Hospital in Dagahley refugee camp where she delivered a healthy boy. Buthul said the candidate, who is a refugee, will sit all her papers at the hospital. Last week, a KCPE candidate from Hagadera refugee camp was allowed to write her exam on a mat outside the classroom. She was unable to write the answers while seated. Schools at the vast Dadaab refugee camp are administered by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and other agencies. Although the teachers are also refugees, all national examinations are manned by Kenyan teachers and supervised the Kenya National Examinations Council. This year, 1,484 refugees are sitting the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exam. Out of the number, 1,028 are boys and 456 girls. There are six exam centres in Dadaab. The government has put up stringent measures to curb exam malpractice countrywide. Examination supervisors and coordinators are under strict instructions to ensure that there are no irregularities in this year's KCPE. Northeastern regional commissioner Mohamed Birik regretted that the region had one of the highest cancellation rates of the national tests last year. Last week, Birik declared the exam centres no-go zones to any other people except monitors, candidates and security personnel. He said the malpractices "happened in the presence of exam managers, invigilators and other officials supervising the exam in all the centres". Edited by R.Wamochie
