Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to address the financial crisis facing The Judiciary. In a press statement on Tuesday, Atwoli said he recognises the heavy responsibility burdening the Judiciary. Atwoli said the handling of corruption and criminal cases is key in dispensation of fair and timely justice so that courts are deemed to be free and independent. "Chief Justice  David Maraga occupies an important position that calls upon all Kenyans to have confidence in him and his team,"he said. "As a highly developed country, we should not retrogress to petty and suspicious informality kind of administration." Atwoli  cautioned the government not mix politics and dispensation of justice as it is Kenyans who will suffer. This follows a public outburst by CJ Maraga on Monday who claimed the Judiciary is being treated with contempt. During a press conference on Monday, Maraga expressed dissatisfaction at the Executive following a cut in the Judiciary's budget. He said the slash has hurt the Judiciary. "The Constitution does not give such a direction in respect of the budget of any other state organ," Maraga said. He added that the Constitution accords the Judiciary special treatment and that no single arm of the government is authorized to exercise the sovereign power of the people. Chief Justice David Maraga has vowed not to attend some state functions unless the government starts treating him and the Judiciary with respect.
