Ivlyn Mutua is set to release her album, '12 Beats of Christmas'. However, she had already released the first song to the album, titled 'Missing You'. The 12-track album features superstars like Mordecai from H_art the Band, Fena, Sage, Wyre, Atemi and Trina Mungai. Mutua takes fans through a story in which she not only reveals her journey through challenges with life but also acknowledges that it wouldnâ€™t be possible without the help of family who kept her positive through it all. "As an artiste, my aim is to impact with my music. Music that people can directly relate both emotionally and through the struggles of life," she said. "For example, if someone lost a loved one, despite the grief, they should accept the situation and pull through with positivity." This debut album, which was recorded in 45 days, will be free of charge and is set to be dropped on December 1.
