Kenya Ports Authority qualified for the second round of Basketball Africa League (BAL) that starts later this month. Coaches Sammy Kiki and Cliff Owuor concurred that KPA can now take on the best after a tight 89-70 win over Cobra Sport of South Sudan in Madagascar. The porters, playing in the Eastern Division, remain unbeaten in Pool ‘F’ and were due to play Usoni of Comoros in their last fixture last evening. “We took the game against the South Sudanese very seriously. It was a tight game but the boys were focused,” Kiki observed. Owuor, who is the national team tactician and was assigned to assist Kiki opined that KPA were on the right track going into the main event. KPA took the first quarter 24-15 but trailed to 20-16 and 21-17 advantage in the second and third quarters. They managed a close 24-22 edge in the deciding stanza. Congolese Michael Kazunguzibwe continued to shine as he sunk 20 points, Valentine Nyakinda shot 16, Ariel Okall hit 14 and Martin Kitongo 11. Deng Moses, Steve Wundi and Leek Malual connected for 18 points each while Alex Tombe added 17 for the Sudanese side. “We came out very aggressive and took advantage of our speed. But at times we had some lapses especially in defending three-point shots,” noted Kiki. “We were able to contain them. I am happy and proud of the team and the effort they put. We have already qualified for the next stage of BAL.”
