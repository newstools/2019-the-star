Five of the six people killed in a road accident near Marula farm on Monday were family members on their way to bury a relative in Naivasha. The sixth was the driver of the four women and a three-year-old child. The five died on the spot while the driver died hours later in a hospital. The car collided head-on with a truck before ramming the side by a lorry. Naivasha deputy OCPD John Kwasa said the car driver was overtaking a truck during the collision with another truck. “We lost five women and a minor. The truck drivers escaped with minor injuries,” Kwasa said. Martin Ndung’u, a relative of the victims, said the six had travelled from Njoro to Naivasha for the burial of a relative on Tuesday (yesterday). “I have lost my sister and two nieces while the others are my cousins and a grandson,” he said. “This is a very painful moment for the family but we are praying for strength as we prepare to lay them to rest,” a distraught Ndung’u said. Meanwhile, a middle-aged man was crushed to death by a boulder in a quarry at Maraigushu, a few kilometres from the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. His colleagues escaped death by a whisker. “The man died on the spot after the boulder hit him on the head. Over 40 people work in the quarry,” Kwasa said.
