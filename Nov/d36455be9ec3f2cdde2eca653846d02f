Probably nothing bothers women like having acne on their faces. At present, one of the societal definition of beauty is a clear and smooth face. As such, women who have acne feel pressured to get rid of acne and feel “beautiful” as per societal expectations.  Some people have pried to the desperation of such women to reap them off their money. There are so many creams in the market that are supposed to get rid of acne and have a smooth face. Some creams do not even have names and are not even medically approved. One common cream is the “mkorogo”, which is a mixture of several skin-lightening creams. The “mkorogo” gets rids of acne and lightens the skin. Sadly, as the name suggests, it is not medically approved since the different creams are mixed manually and sold at surprisingly high prices to desperate customers. Many Kenyans would be surprised to know that the “mkorogo” creams they buy cost more than visiting a professional dermatologist. Many women fail to visit dermatologists claiming the skin healing process takes too long to bear fruits compared to the “mkorogo” option. However, the “mkorogo” has adverse effects such as lightening the skin excessively to the extent of botching up the face. Imagine living with a botched up face while a dermatologist would have treated the acne safely and permanently. Next time you develop acne or rashes on the face, do not rush to Dubois Road for some expensive “mkorogo” that smoothens the face in one day. Instead, visit a professional dermatologist and receive a permanent solution. Skin healing routines from a dermatologist might be slow, but they are sure, safe and permanent. Nakuru
