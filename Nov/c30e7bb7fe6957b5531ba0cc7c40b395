Thunder coach Collins Gaya believes the two playoff wins recorded by his charges over the weekend can now spur them all the way. Gaya was speaking after Thunder struck Eldonets 97-57 to advance to the semis in a quarter-finals tie at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium. “We are headed for the semis against either Equity or Strathmore. The two results suggest the team was peaking at the right time.” After a shocking Game One loss in Eldoret, Thunder convincingly won Game Two 82-50 and shut the losers out by winning the series 2-1. National team captain Griffin Ligare scored 26 points, Kevin Chogo shot 20 and Faheem Juma added 19. The match was delayed for an hour due to poor lighting although the issue was later sorted. Thunder, who finished the regular season in the second position, now joins top seed Ulinzi Warriors who eliminated Lakeside. Baobab also qualified from the lower division after they hit Kenya Christian Industrial Training Institute 65-61. Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology were the other qualifier after shutting out Nebulus 97-70. In regular season matches, women champions Equity Bank defeated Strathmore University Swords 61-51 in a tough encounter.
