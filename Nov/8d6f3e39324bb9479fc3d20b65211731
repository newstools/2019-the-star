EQUITY Bank tackle Emyba in an epic play-off quarter-finals Game Two match at the Nyayo Stadium this evening. The bankers had to use every trick in the book to pip a stubborn Emyba side 66-64 in the best of three series opener at the same venue a week ago. Tony Mwendwa was unstoppable for Emyba in that encounter, sinking 18 points and Equity will have to figure out how best to stop him from start. Lenson Kisia, who posted 12, will have to team up well with Titus Musembi and Alex Oguso to lift Equity who will miss injured Faisal Aden and Kevin Kigotho. Action will start with a lower division fixture that pits Kenyatta University Pirates against KDF Morans. The match tips off at 6 pm. Tomorrow, women champion Equity Bank start title defence against number eight Tangit Sparks. Equity coach David Maina said he will miss national team star Betty Kananu through injury but will rely on the rising Linda Alando to excel. KPA, who are placed third, will play Eagle Wings in a game they are favoured to win with ease. Third-placed Strathmore University Swords will take on Storm while the University of Nairobi Dynamites confront Zetech University. In the lower division, Kisumu Lady Bucks host Eldonets in the lakeside town while KPA Youth are at home to Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.
