Tourism sites in Nandi county will be mapped by the National Museums of Kenya. Governor Stephen Sang and museums director General Mzalendo Kibunjia signed an Mou on Monday in Kapsabet, saying Nandi was a key northern tourism circuit site. “Nandi has rich tourism sites that have remained unexploited since they remain unknown, however, we will ensure they are mapped to become new attractions,” Kibunjia said. Sites include Mau Mau caves, destroyed meeting sites of slave traders, Nandi Rock, Chepkiit Falls, Kiplolok Springs, Chepsangor Hills, Kimwani blocks and the tropical south Nandi forest. He  said the rich history of the Nandi people remain unexploited and that the county was known to have produced some of the most brave men and women. The National Museums will provide professional training to Nandi government staff from departments of tourism and culture. Nandi has very few curators and the National Museums will provide new opportunities for the youths. Until 2005, when President Mwai Kibaki ordered construction of a mausoleum in honour of legendary leader Orkoiyot Samoei killed in 1905, little was known of the site where he was killed. Samoei had led a 10-year resistance about British colonial rule compulsory takeover of their land for growing tea. Sang said, his government was focussing on tourism for economic gains. “in our Kenyan history, people have been reading about key Nandi leaders including Ipnyolei, Jean Marie Seroney, Chelagat Mutai and the famous Nandi rock,” he said. “We will ensure Kenyans and other visitors know where to find these sites," Sang said.
