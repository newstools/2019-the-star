Some 18 Form 4 students of Kobala Mixed Secondary were arrested for allegedly sneaking out of the school for a night out. The students were 16 boys and two girls. They were arrested by the chief in Wang’ Chieng, Karachuonyo constituency, after some residents reported them to him. They sneaked out on Saturday night for a disco in the village. They danced past midnight and went and camped inside a house at a home within the area, where chief Peter Agunga arrested them on Sunday and took them to his office. He said the students jumped out of the school using a wooden ladder. “We rushed to the house where the students had locked themselves and found 16 boys. We took them to my office before being joined by the two girls,” Agunga said on Monday. The administrator said he detained the students and called their parents. “We handed the children to their parents who took them back to school. The school management has confirmed they returned and are taking their exams,” Agunga said. He appealed to the candidates to adhere to school regulations until they complete their exams. “Let students not engage in activities that are likely to spoil their future,” he added. Homa Bay county commissioner Herman Shambi had banned night discos and live bands in the county. The commissioner directed local chiefs to ensure the ban was immediately effected to allow candidates to get ample time for their national exams.
