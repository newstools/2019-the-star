Quins coach Dominique Habimana is not worried about the slow start to the  2019 Kenya Cup season. The Ngong road giants have lost their two opening fixtures, losing 26-13 to Homeboyz and 32-20 to champions KCB but the former Nakuru and Kenya Simbas assistant coach believes his charges will come good as the season progresses. " I'm not worried at all. We have played two formidable sides and they have shown their quality. There are certain areas we need to improve on as a unit but I still think we are headed in the right direction,” added Habimana. He observed that being a long season, his charges will not be defined by just two games. "It's a long tough season. There will be ups and downs. We have not lost our goal for this season — qualifying for the playoffs,” added Habimana. Quins gave away three soft tries in the opening forty minutes against KCB and trailed 29-3 at half time before staging a comeback in the second half to score 17 points and limiting the bankers to a just a penalty. "The boys fought hard in the second half and showed character to take the game to KCB,” he observed. Habimana, however, warned that they can't afford to continue with the poor start in going forward. "It's very difficult to play catch-up rugby and that is something we are telling the players — start well, control tempo and score as many points as possible,” said Habimana, whose side is bottom of the pile. Quins next face Western Bulls at the RFUEA ground this weekend with fixtures against Nakuru, Menenegai Oilers, Mwamba and neighbours Impala coming up.
