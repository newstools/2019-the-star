Harambee Starlets coach David Ouma is confident that his charges can finish the job and clinch a maiden Cecafa Women championships crown when they take on hosts Tanzania in the final this afternoon. Starlets easily romped to the final with a 5-0 win over Burundi in the semifinals played on Saturday at the Azam Complex in Chamazi. A brace from teenage sensation Jentrix Shikangwa, who currently tops the scorers’ chart,  and a goal apiece by skipper Dorcas Shikobe, Mwanalima Adam and Corazon Aquino, saw the Starlets express their dominance ahead of the high-stake final. "I am happy with not only the result in the semis against Burundi but also the performance of the team. Our focus is now on the final, and I am confident that we will come home with the trophy,” said coach Ouma. Starlets are yet to concede a goal at the tournament in their four outings ahead of today final. Ouma's charges have plundered 22 goals and are the tournament's leading scorers. Their biggest win was in the second group match where they thrashed Djibouti 12-0. Ouma is likely to keep faith with the team that started in the last four encounters. Shikangwa's performances, however, will provide some headache for the coaching staff as they look to assemble a winning side to start against Tanzania.
