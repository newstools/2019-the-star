Nairobi residents will benefit from an additional 10 million litres of water daily following the drilling of 29 boreholes. Athi Water Works Development Agency managing director Michael Thuita on Friday said the boreholes, which cost Sh200 million, are spread in the 17 city subcounties. Over 200,000 people, especially in informal settlements, will benefit. “The 29 boreholes will provide a total of over 10,000m3 per day of water to Nairobi hence cut deficiency in the city,” he said in a statement. Nairobi has a daily shortfall of 250 million litres of water and many city residents are forced to rely on vendors who sell a 20-litre jerrican for up to Sh50. The Nairobi county government has been rationing supply to cope with the deficit. He said a majority of the boreholes are already in operation including in Kibra Primary and Moi Girls Nairobi, Langata Health Centre, Joseph Kangethe Social Hall and Kenyatta University Field Area. Embakasi Health Centre, Wilson Airport Reservoir, Garden Estate Secondary School, and Kamala Police Station also have boreholes. Other boreholes that have been commissioned include Karen Shopping Area BPT, Kenyatta Market, Maisha Poa Centre, ASK Jamuhuri Grounds, Loresho Ground Reservoir, Kabarnet Gardens, Gigiri Reservoir, Kabete Water Works, Ndararua Primary School and SGR Terminus Nairobi. Thuita said AWWAD is drilling the boreholes in partnership with the county government and the Ministry of Water. He said the boreholes will supplement water supply within the city by the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company. “The 200 million was sufficient for the development of 29 out of 40 boreholes. To complete the remaining 11 boreholes, Sh100 million is required,” he said. Thuita noted that the boreholes will also reduce over-reliance on dam water. During drought seasons, rivers supplying water to the dams dry up causing a shortage, he said.
