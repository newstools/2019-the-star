A matatu driver was killed and 11 passengers seriously injured in a road accident at Chabera along the Kisumu-Kisii road on Thursday. The morning accident happened when the driver tried to overtake a lorry near the Chabera bridge. The vehicle hit the lorry on the side. Christopher Obunga died shortly after arriving at Sigowet Hospital in neighbouring Kericho county where he was rushed. The Chabera bridge is narrow but is under construction to expand it. A witness said the accident occurred at around 7:30 am. “The matatu hit the lorry as it tried to overtake it," a witness said. Chabera is in Homa Bay near its border with Kericho and Nyamira counties. Area police commander Charles Barasa said both vehicles were moving in the same at the time of the crash. The 11 passengers, included a six-month-old baby. They were all rushed to Sigowet Hospital. Obunga had sustained head injuries. “Some passengers sustained serious injuries like fractures. They were admitted for specialised medication,” Barasa said. He said the lorry driver lost control of the vehicle after the brakes failed as he tried to avoid the matatu. Barasa appealed to motorists to be vigilant, saying roads were wet because of rains. “We want all road users to be cautious to avoid accidents,” Barasa said. The driver of the lorry disappeared. Barasa said the wreckages will be towed to Oyugis police station for inspection.  edited by p. obuya
