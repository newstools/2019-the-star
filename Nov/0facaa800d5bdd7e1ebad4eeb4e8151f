The 'Lone Ranger' police officer whose beheaded body was found in a mangrove forest in Lamu on October 5 was murdered by drug dealers. Coast regional Commissioner John Elungata said on Tuesday that Constable Hesbon  Anunda is believed to have been lured to his death by a phone call asking to arrest a drug dealer. He took the bait and was ambushed and murdered — a warning to other anti-drugs cops. Anunda was called the Lone Ranger for his outspoken determination to eliminate drugs and drug dealers. He didn't mince words. His body was discovered three days after he was reported missing from Tchundwa police post in Lamu East. His G3 rifle with  60 rounds of ammunition has never been found. Elungata has vowed to deal ruthlessly with drug cartels. He revealed a drugs syndicate targeting police officers who pursue dealers. He said all criminal elements targeting security officers will be dealt with harshly. Elungata said officers are working to smash the syndicate so the law can take its course. The murderers are probably still in possession of the rifle, Elungata said. He appealed to the public to cooperate with the police and provide information leading to arrest of the killers and recovery of the firearm. “We believe the killers want to use the gun to silence any other person who threatens their drug business. Whoever has that gun will definitely use it one of these days., Elungata said. The regional commissioner said investigations into the murder were still underway. Officers are looking into call logs and other intel. Anunda's colleagues described him as fearless and bold as he would go on a mission alone and succeed. “While we would be shaking from fear of the unknown, he would lead from the front. He would command a sting operation and we would succeed. He was something else," an officer told the Star. Edited by R.Wamochie
