A high school teacher was allegedly hacked to death by his younger brother during a quarrel over Nandi land, police said. John Sang, 52,  a teacher at Tambach High School in Elgeyo Marakwet, was slashed by Joel Kpyego, 40, police said. The murder occurred at Chepsiria village, Kongoro location of Aldai subcounty. Nandi police commander Samson Kinne said the suspect surrendered at  Miwani police station soon after the death because he was pursued by a lynch mob. “The deceased found his brother burning charcoal using trees from his share of the shamba. He had planted the trees  a couple of years ago,” Kinne said. The assailant grabbed a panga after he was caught poaching his brother's trees, he said. “He fled immediately as hundreds of armed residents hunted him down with the intention of lynching him. But he surrendered to police in Miwani as he attempted cross to Kisumu," the police boss said. The body was taken to Kasabet County Referral Hospital. The suspect was handed over to the DCI in Nandi Hills. Kinne said police would present the suspect in court and seek time for investigation and a psychiatric exam. (Edited by V. Graham)
