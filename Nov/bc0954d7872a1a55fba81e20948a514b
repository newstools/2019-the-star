Slain journalist Eric Oloo died from trauma caused by injury to his head and abdomen, a preliminary postmortem report shows. Government pathologist Gabriel Juma on Sunday said Oloo died as a result of excessive bleeding. "The body had a blunt injury on the head and a severe hemorrhage intra-abdominally as a result of the blunt injury on the abdomen," Juma said. He spoke at Sega Funeral Home where the autopsy was conducted after the body was transferred from Ambira Hospital Mortuary. Oloo was found dead on Thursday morning in the house of Ugunya deputy OCS Sabina Kerubo. The Star journalist is believed to have been killed by brothers in a suspected love triangle involving the officer. Juma said Oloo could have been hit by a blunt object as internal bleeding was witnessed.  He said trauma may not have been caused by a sharp object. Family pathologist Cedrick Tumbo said they have already handed over their report to the family and the police. The family was freed to carry on with the burial arrangements, Tumbo said. Family spokesman Michael Nyagilo said they will wait for the law to take its course. Meanwhile, police have arrested a fifth suspect in connection with the murder. Sabina, her daughter and househelp and a man believed to have been present in the house at the time of the murder were arrested on Thursday. Siaya county police commander Francis Kooli said the fifth suspect, Franklin Luta, was arrested in Gem.  No suspect has been arraigned. Family members wondered why they have not been taken to court. “A suspect is supposed to be presented in court within a period of 24 hours after his or her arrest. Why are the police handling our son’s case casually,” a relative who did not want to be named said.
