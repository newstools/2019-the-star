Kenya Power staff will no longer enjoy their afternoon tea beginning December 1, as the company cuts down on in a bid to cut down on costs. "Management continues to implement a raft of measures to manage various costs addresses are hereby notified that the provision of afternoon tea services shall be suspended," acting general manager David Monandi said. In a statement on Monday, Monandi said the management seeks the support, cooperation and understanding of everyone as they navigate to turn around the business. UPSURGE IN COSTS In a separate statement, Kenya Power's managing director Bernard Ngungi said the management has observed with concern an upsurge in staff costs in the company. These include overtime travel and associated cost elements. "These costs have reached unsustainable levels ultimately affecting our bottom line and threatening the sustainability of the business," Ngugi said. Ngugi said instances of staff and teams reporting late for work and leaving before scheduled time have also been noted. "...raising serious questions of effective supervision on the ground while managers and other supervisors will be held accountable for the containment and control of various costs in their respective dockets including offering effective leadership," he said. Ngugi urged all staff to commit and rededicate themselves inefficiently serving our customers.
