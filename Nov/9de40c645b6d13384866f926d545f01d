Kenya Swimming Federation(KSF) require Sh54 million to successfully host the CANA Zone 3 Swimming Championships slated for later this month at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Kenya Swimming Federation (KSF)  interim chairman Patrick Muyah has appealed to government and corporates to support the initiative.  “If we are to host the event, we will require Sh54 million. The money will cater for accommodation,  transport,  trophies, medals and other logistics for the four-day event," he added. Despite budgetary constraints that most federations are facing, Muyah was confident the country will successfully host the championship. “I'm confident we will host a successful championship. I am certain with support from different quarters, we can pull it off,” he noted. Ten countries including hosts Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania,  Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan Rwanda, Burundi and Egypt are expected for the event.  According to Muyah, Kenya will be represented by two teams of 40 swimmers each. Team 'A' will comprise elite swimmers who will be competing for medals while the 'B' team will be first-timers at that level and will feature for exposure purposes. Local Organizing Committee (LOC) chairman, Jen Maina: “ This will be a learning curve for Team 'B' swimmers for the sake of future events. I am confident with good preparations, this will be the beginning of good things to come," added Maina.  Maina said by virtue of hosting the championship, Kenya's swimmers will have the home ground advantage. The Kenya team will be named later this month.
