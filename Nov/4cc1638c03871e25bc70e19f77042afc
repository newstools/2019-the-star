Three Nairobi MCAs pocketed a Sh200,000 treated bribe from the owner of Kiragu Waichahi School to influence an inquiry against the school, an investigator revealed. MCAs David Mberia (Langata), Jared Okode (Mathare) and Abraham Mwangi (Woodley) were arrested immediately after taking the bribe. They were allegedly bribed to make a favourable report to the assembly following claims they had made that the private school in Eastleigh was illegal. The revelation was made by EACC investigator Martin Ongara on Wednesday in his evidence in chief at a Milimani court before magistrate Thomas Nzioki. “Together with my colleagues, we treated the money after receiving a complaint from a man named Samuel Maina that the accused persons, who are members of Culture and Social Services committee, were demanding Sh1 million from him to influence a favourable report over his property,” Ongara told the court. MCA Mberia is accused of corruptly demanding Sh1 million from Maina to influence the outcome of an inquiry carried out by the Culture and Social Services committee of the Nairobi county assembly. He is also accused of corruptly demanding Sh500,000, Sh 200,000 and another Sh200,000 from the same complainant. Okode and Mwangi are accused of corruptly asking for Sh200,000 each from the complainant so as to influence the same investigations. The accused persons were released on a Sh500,000 cash bail each. The inquiry was done in regards to the ownership of the land on which Kiragu Waichahi School is located in Pumwani ward of Kamukunji constituency.
