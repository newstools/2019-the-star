Petroleum and Mining CS John Munyes has appointed Macharia Irungu as Kenya Pipeline Company's new Managing Director. Hudson Andambi has been the acting MD since December 2018 after the arrest of former MD Joe Sang and other top managers on allegations of corruption. In a statement, the CS said that the KPC Board of Directors settled on Irungu after a vigorous recruitment process. The board received 88 applicants seeking to fill the position out of which nine were shortlisted. "The names of the three candidates who scored highest were thereafter forward to me for a final decision on who should be appointed the Managing Director," part of Munyes statement read. The CS said Irungu scored the highest points from a final list of three names and brings a 28-year experience in the field to the company. Up to his appointment, Irungu has been working as the MD of the Gulf Africa Petroleum Corporation which is a member of the Total Group. Munyes lauded Andambi for his services delivered to the company during his time as the acting MD. The CS said his decision was reached after wide consultation, giving the board enough time to continue with the ongoing recruitment. "Andambi proved himself as a capable steward of the KPC's affairs during a period of considerable turmoil and has helped lay the foundations for KCP's future access," Munyes said.
