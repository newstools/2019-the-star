Friday was a great day for “former” Miss Zippy Bett, soon to be Mrs Nyamari as top Kenyan musician Nyamari Ongegu, better known as Nyashinski, formally asked for her hand in marriage and received a resounding affirmation. At a traditional dowry negotiation / handover ceremony held at her parent’s rural home in Itigo, Nandi County, Nyamari’s family were elated when they officially received Zippy from her parents to mark the conclusion of the dowry process. The new couple then exchanged gifts in what turned out to be a traditional wedding ceremony, a pre-cursor to a white wedding to be held at a yet to be announced date. Zippy, a fashion stylist who runs her own outfit, Zia Collection Africa, was in the company of a bevy of beauties, her close friends, while Nyamari was accompanied by close personal and industry friends including Nameless, Bien and Savara of Sauti Sol, BigPin, UB, Talent Manager Fakii Liwali, Roba (former Kleptomaniax group member). “This is possibly if not certainly the best day of my life” stated Nyamari, at the end of the ceremony, while Zippy repeatedly thanked God for the blessings of Nyamari, family and friends at the end of a beautiful beginning of the rest of her life. “He who finds a wife finds a good thing.”
