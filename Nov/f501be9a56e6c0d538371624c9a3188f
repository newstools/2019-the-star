Youth and Gender CS Margaret Kobia has asked youths to acquire skills, do voluntary jobs and invest in life skills to relate well with employers. “We have technical vocational education and training to make youths acquire skills. This is why the government is changing the curriculum to Competence-Based,” she said when issuing Sh18 million Youth Fund. Kobia told youths to express themselves and expose their self-worth in all professions. “A study by Aga Khan University shows youth’s unemployment is due to skill gaps, lack of life skills to communicate what they want to be in future. Youths have weak communication in building relationships. Youths must invest in building relationships like negotiation, persuasive and soft skills,” she said on Monday. The CS, however, said that the government is bringing opportunities that cater to the needs of youths by giving them enterprise funds to start small businesses. She said President Uhuru Kenyatta supports efforts in empowering youth, who make up 70 per cent of our population. Kobia noted that there are several challenges facing the youth especially in identifying what they want to do. Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi said his administration aims at empowering and transforming youths not only through sporting but also in the acquisition of relevant job market skills. Kiraitu castigated the youth and local artists for not tapping the music industry. “There is a time when I was forced to contract a band for entertainment away from Meru due to skill gap in the county. I challenge Meru musicians to think outside the box and we will show the nation and world we are capable,” he said. Sports PS Kirimi Kaberia said sports help grow indigenous culture and has positive effects on health. Edited by R.Wamochie
